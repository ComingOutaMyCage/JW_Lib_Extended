<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font14"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Persia—the Land of Extremes</span></h5>
<p><span class="font16">E</span><span class="font10">VERY land where the Devil has had sway is 'more or less a land of extremes. It is his </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">way of</span><span class="font10"> ruling. There is a philosophy in it, too. He selects a chosen few as his representatives, and by the very wealth which he lavishes upon them they so dazzle the common people as to keep them in subjection, keep them in order, make them their hewers of rvood and drawers of water. This is particularly true of the land of Persia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Persia is a land of contrasts. It is a land of the most beautiful gardens and the most forbidding of deserts; of the most lovely climates and the most inhospitable; of art and of squalor; of wealth in the extreme and of poverty in the last degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Though Persia has been described as <sup>B</sup>a land where no water is”, yet there is no place on earth where the nobility are as proud of their gardens. Even the poorest of the poor have some sort of garden, if they have any roofs over their heads at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In latitude it corresponds to the southern states of the United. States, from Philadelphia to Key West. From t W northwest to the southeast ■ is as far as from Portland, Maine, to Jacksonville; and from the northeast to the southwest, as far as from. Atlanta to Milwaukee. The area is about one-fifth that of the whole United States. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It seldom rains in Persia in the summer; hence water must be brought all the way from the mountains in aqueducts, requiring incessant labor to keep them open. This water is conducted through the gardens in trenches and finally lands in the open pool which is the star feature of the family garden, and incidentally provides an ideal place for the breeding of mosquitoes and other insect pests for which the country is famous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ In these pools the family dishes are washed, and also the family feet and hands. But lest you gag too easily over this last item, we pause to remark that such bathing of the hands and feet is rare. Indeed, in the case of babies, the Persian mother has the idea that water is injurious to an infant, and hence its first bath is at six months of age. This first ablution of the child is usually given in a public bath, in which others bathe daily and in which the water is changed once in ten days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Despite the fact that there is no clean piped water in Persia, but the supply for each family is taken from open ditches, and despite the occasional loss of babies through falling into the family pool and drowning, the Persians somehow manage to survive. The reason no doubt is that it is a land of sunshine and none can wholly escape its life-giving rays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">.4 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Huge Basin Within Mountains</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Persia is a huge basin within mountains. To get into the country from almost any direction one must climb over a high mountain. The rivers in the interior are few and small and terminate in salt marshes with no outlet. The whole land would be a desert but for the high mountains which surround it. As the winter snows melt they provide water throughout the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Each city is an oasis, separated from' each other city by the inhospitable lands of the desert. In between these oases the soil has been eroded until nothing but barren ridges are left. There was a time when much of the intervening area was well covered with vegetation, but een-' furies of mismanagement have left it in bad condition, difficult of rehabilitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is no doubt because of the large stretches of desert lands intervening between the various cities that Persia has remained a land in which, the people prefer to stay at home rather than to travel, and the same influence has made them lovers of and makers of gardens. The favorfi e</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark9"></a>m. QOLDEN AQE</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">design of the garden is a succession of terraces, with water falling from one terrace to another </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">un</span><span class="font10">til it finally lands in the family pool. The Persian refers to his home as his garden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The distances between the cities has led to brigandage, and has made close government of the territory difficult. Among the poor, food of any kind is scarce. It has been estimated that three out of every four Persian children die before they reach the age of five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">During the World War, when the opposing armies were ignoring her rights and trampling upon her neutrality, conditions in some sections became so terrible that the starving people ate horses, cats and dogs, and even the flesh of their own dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Ons of the Oldest Empires</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Persia is one of the oldest of empires. At one time a part of Media, the Persians, under Cyrus, revolted from the Medes, engaged in a bloody struggle with them, and finally succeeded, not only in establishing their independence, but in changing places with their masters and becoming the ruling people. This turning of the tables took place about 550 B.C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Cyrus went on and conquered Babylon, and his son even conquered Egypt. A successor, Darius, a great general and born leader of men, extended his empire east into India and west into Europe. One of his generals captured and burned Constantinople. Darius coined the first Persian money. Both Cyrus and Darius are many times mentioned in the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Darius was succeeded by Xerxes, or Zerzes, supposed to be Ahasuerus “which reigned from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces”. (Esther 1:1) From his day the country began to retrograde. Since then it has been many times overrun, and often in anarchy. It was overrun by Alexander the Great, king of Macedonia, in 331 B. C., and in the thirteenth century (A.D.) by Genghis Khan, the slayer of thirteen million of his fellow creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For handed )f years, until .August 5, 1.906, the ruler of Peiila was an absolute despot, and even now its Mejliss, or Parliament, is a very tame affair of 120 deputies, 40 of whom constitute a quorum. In 1925 the- then reigning monarch, Shah Ahmed Kadjar, lost his job because he spent all his time gambling at Monte Carlo, Nice and Paris; but he does not care, because he is a very rich man. His crown jewels include the Great Mogul, one of the largest and most beautiful diamonds in existence, and have been appraised at $40,000,000. When the vote came to be taken, which cost him his throne, he ■was so unpopular that only five out of eighty-five voters voted to retain him. He was in Paris at the time the vote was taken,.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Fanaticism and Bigotry</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mohammedanism is a plagiarism of the Scriptures, and a heartless system of bigotry and superstition, appealing to the basest emotions. It is this that is the “religion” of Persia. The people are under the thumb of the priests or mullahs. Thirteen hundred years after his death the Persians spend one month of each year in mourning for Hussein, one of the sons of Mohammed’s son-in-law<sup>7</sup>, because he was slain while at prayer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the year 1924 the American consul general in Persia, Robert W. Imbrie, one of the best friends Persia ever had, was killed by a mob of Moslem fanatics merely for taking a photograph of a “holy” well. His real slayers were the mullahs, who made the people believe the well is ‘holy’. There are some Jews, Babists, Zoroastrians and so-called “Christians” in Persia, and they have not had an easy time trying to live with the Moslems. The influence of the mullahs will prevent Persia from going Bolshevik. The mullahs do not wish to lose their jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Ages of despotism, and the curse of a fanatical religion, have left the stamp of cruelty upon Persia. The Persist is nervous, artistic, voluble, witty and polite, but he is cruel. The ancestor of the shah who has recently been deposed, Agha Mohammed, caused 35,000 inhabitants of Kerman to be blinded because the city had offended him; he sold into slavery 20,000 'women and children; he caused a pyramid to be built of the skulls of his antagonists. His son caused a general ■who had offended him to be bricked up in a dungeon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Agha came into possession of the Persian throne by one of the most clever tricks ever perpetrated. His opponent Lutf, with a handful of men, defeated Agha’s army of 30,000 men. .Unnoticed, Agha remained in his tent while all about him. fled. With the coming of sunset he bid his muezzin call the faithful to prayer as usual. The effect was wonderful. The fleeing soldiers returned in such numbers that the tide of battle was turned and Agha gained the victory over his courageous, generous and able foeman, whom he afterward had put to death by torture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One of the most progressive men now living in Persia, Saram-ed-Dowleh, a one-time cabinet minister, who seems to have taken a real interest in housing and other problems, murdered his own mother with a shotgun because his father ordered him to do so. She had been suspected of infidelity. In few places in the earth would a man thus unhesitatingly kill his own mother at somebody else’s request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Hiza Shak Pahlavi</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font10"> is no admirer of aristocrats, autocrats and dictators; nor is it an admirer of Riza Khan, Persia’s new ruler. The newspapers like to picture him as a. stableboy that came to be a monarch. That is all folderol. His father was master of ceremonies under two shahs, and he himself is an aristocrat who went into the army to learn the business from the bottom up. Possibly his father suggested to him that some time he could do the very thing- he has done, grab the whole country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The revolution which put Riza Khan on the Persian throne urns a bloodless one. The people wanted him there; that is one reason why he is there. He is well educated, a pianist of fine technique. Besides Persian, he speaks Russian, French and German.. He is said to be a charming conversationalist, -witty and well informed. Like his countrymen, he is a devout Mohammedan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Riza has increased his army to 60,000 men and has the country under discipline, as far as that is possible in a territory embracing such vast wastes. He has all modern equipment, airplanes, tanks and wireless. Idle first thing he did after he had seized control was to dismiss all his Russian and British officers, an act that made him very popular all over the country. He has reformed the army, hanged the bandits, made traveling safe, and tried to do away with open corruption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Riza is no coward, and he is a leader. Nearly 60 years of age, on one occasion he dashed into the camp of an enemy and slew the rebel leader rvitli his own hand. Everything comes to his desk, and he makes an effort to keep it clear. He is said to be tall, heavy, of imposing carriage, calm, slow, definite, unyielding, and capable of unrelenting enmity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Humanitarians have pleaded with him to let one of his old enemies, the sheik of Moham-merah, who is slowly dying of an incurable disease, end. his life- in Germany, where lie can receive medical attention. But no, the old man is technically a prisoner and must finish out his days in the house assigned to him just outside Teheran. He is said to be an adept in choosing subordinates and playing one off against another in such a way as to gradually elevate himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He is </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font10"> great admirer of Mustapha Kemal Pasha, of Turkey, and is doing all possible to emulate him. In future all Persian men must wear coat and trousers, the same as we barbarians of English and American extraction. And they must all wear the pahlavi, which is a new form of headgear named after the Riza Khan Pahlavi himself. Government officials are required to wear, at least part of the time, clothing made in Persian mills. Persia hopes soon to be able to work up her own cotton from the fields of Azerbaijan, performing all the operations until it reaches the consumers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Some of the Natural Features</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Persia has thirty lakes, all of them salt. Both the lakes and the rivers that run into them have an uncanny habit of shifting themselves from one location to another. It is believed that at the time of the Flood Persia was a sort of quiet spot in the waters within which the ark floated without being exposed to much turbulent treatment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Violent sandstorms are frequent in the spring in the desert regions, and hailstorms with bail as large as marbles occur in the same season in the north. In a day’s travel one may be amid heavy frosts and in a tropical zone of luxuriant palms and intense heat. In Arabistan the dry heat in summer reaches 120 degrees indoors. Some parts which are very fertile abound in malaria and insect pests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Flowers are abundant, roses flourishing so profusely that they are cultivated for perfume. The famous Persian eat is now well known all over the world. There are numerous weird types of reptiles and spiders. Fresh water fish are rare; the lakes are destitute of animal life. There are numerous quagmires through which nothing can pass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Along the Caspian seaboard wild animgls are plentiful: hyenas, leopards, tigers, ch|etahSj jackals, lynxes, wild goats, wild asses and smaller creatures. Lions exist in some sections. . he boundaries of the country are indeterminate, a cause of much friction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The center of Persia is a vast plateau of 3,000 to 5,000 feet above sea level, traversed by ridges running for a hundred miles at 8,000 to ’ 10,000 feet, rising in places to 16,000 to 17,000 feet. In southern Persia the mountain ranges present a succession of parallel ridges and valleys, so that it is possible to drive between the ranges for hundreds of miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The air in the interior is dry and exhilarating, - and clear, enabling the vision to travel incredible distances. Extremes of heat and cold alternate. In the north heavy snows occur from November to March. The sun shines fiercely by day, but at night the temperature falls to 15 or 20 degrees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Some of the Treasures</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Coal exists all over Persia, and is being mined in two places. Miners will laugh when told that the way a Persian mines coal is to dig a hole in the ground and when the coal is reached throw it to the surface, but when this is no longer practicable the excavation is abandoned and a fresh one started. As a consequence the best coal is never reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Lead and copper mines have been worked from time immemorial. Persia is known to have some of the most valuable copper deposits in the world. There are also iron, zinc, tin, manganese, gold, silver, mercury and marble. The pearl fisheries on the Persian gulf are annually worth about $2,500,000 and employ 70,000 fishermen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But the greatest treasure of all is oil, of which there is so much that it is believed the country will eventually produce as much as the United States, which at present produces 65 percent of the world’s supply. This oil is now in the control of Great Britain. No doubt you have heard of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Anglo-Persian Oil Company employs some 20,000 persons, and spends enormous sums for the founding of hospitals and schools for its own employees and others. Fifteen percent of its profits go to Persian government, but it is to all intents a state within a state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In these oil fields the British fleet has always a supply of oil to protect its trade route to the East. If at any time this company were to get in trouble with the Persian government there is not the slightest doubt that Britain would take control of Persia, or as much of it as suited her purposes. The oil would come first, and the neutrality next.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Persian oil has been known since the days of Plutarch, and was known to Alexander the Great. The Persians saluted Alexander by sprinkling the street to his dwelling with naphtha, and then lighting it at one end. In consequence the whole street was soon ablaze from, end to-end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Opium Question</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Opium is produced in 18 out of the 33'provinces of Persia, and its production is scattered over an area of 400,000 square miles. The city of Ispahan produces 4| million pounds of opium a year, most of which goes to China. The opium growers include many of the most influential clergy, and it is well known that the opium growers and merchants are the wealthiest people in the country. This makes it difficult to control the trade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another great difficulty is the method of paying the growers. The extra hands are usually ■ paid in opium sap or in part cash and part sap; and. as there are 5,000 of these extra hands employed in Ispahan in time of harvest, and as they dispose of the sap to peddlers, storekeepers and others, it may readily be seen why anything approaching control is hard to obtain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The growing of opium appeals to the Persian mind. The returns per acre are higher than for any other Persian crop, opium requires little water, and other crops can be planted on the same ground after the opium is gathered. Opium is not dependent on railroads or even good roads for transport, and there is always a ready market for the sap and the export opium. It is too bad that it should be so, but it is so. Poppy juice represents 20 percent of Persia’s entire export trade and 10 percent of the government’s revenue. Some attempt has been, made at curtailment, but it is futile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Bedeviled by Britain and Russia</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For the same reason that she is afraid to build a tunnel under the British Channel, or to let anybody else build one, Britain has done everything humanly possible to retard the development of Persia. The theory has been that Bus-sia wants India; and as Persia is on the highroad, everything possible must be done to make the road difficult of travel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In 1914 Russian troops invaded the northern part of Persia, and Britain the southern part. This was to keep Germany out of Afghanistan, still farther on the road to India. In August, 1919, a treaty was signed by which Persia virtually lost her independence. Previously there had been in force an agreement between Russia and Britain that Persia was to be divided into three zones of influence, with Russia in the north, Britain in the south and east, and a central zone where each could do as she liked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This is like two highwaymen holding up a man and each agreeing to take the contents of the pants pocket nearest him, and to fight - for what he may have left. Britain has always been a corrupting influence at the court at Teheran. To many British statesmen this has seemed necessary in order to protect British interests; but, to the Devil, everything he does is necessary. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The invasion of northern Persia by Russian armies in 1914, and the resulting requisitioning of armies and withdrawal of food supplies, reduced the country to famine and resulted in the death of one-fifth of all the people in the country. At present the Persians have no confidence in the good intentions of any foreign power. And ■why should they have?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Since the establishment of the Soviet, the Persian people have been notified that Russia no longer adheres to czarist policies, but wishes to see the Persian people independent, flourishing and controlling their own possessions. It has also said that none of the Russian loans need be repaid. Nearly all the commerce which northern Persia conducts with Europe must pass through Russia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is only since July, 1928, that Persia has been mistress of her own customs tariff, and until that time foreigners were tried by their own consul courts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A recent concession to the British allows the British Imperial Airways to pass through South Persia, effecting a junction at Bushire with the Junkers Line from Teheran, thus bringing Persia into communication by air with India, and the Far East. Persia herself will construct and own the airdromes, which will thus be available for the airplanes of all nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Persia and England are continually quarreling over the islands in the Persian Gulf. Persia has always had them, and wants to keep them because they are near at hand. England wants them for the same reason that she wants everything else on the earth. Persia recently protested to England’s League of Nations about the possession of some of these islands. Britain has hung on to the islands on the ground that they are necessary for the protection of British coaling stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The next time you are pestered with mosquitoes go and take the screen door off your neighbor’s house; and if he wants to know 'why you did it, tell him you had to do it to keep the mosquitoes out of your home. Then put the door up on your own house and make yourself at home. The seizure of the island of Ormuz in 1622 is what gave Britain the control of India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Persian Men .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Persian men are described as <sup>ft</sup>a people of lively and impressible minds, brave and impetuous in w<sup>r</sup>ar, witty, passionate, for Orientals truthful, not without some spirit of generosity, and of more intellectual capacity than the generality of Asiatics”. The estimated population of the country is 10,000,000. The area of the country is 628,000 square miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Persia is a land of large proprietors and landless peasants. The peasant plows with oxen and a bent stick, as his ancestors always did. Three-fifths of his crop goes to the landlord. A landowner may possess hundreds of square miles of arable land, with a dozen or more villages on it, without ever seeing the district more than three or four times in his life. The head man of the village' does the business with the agent of the ovmer, the same as he did 500 years ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The nomadic tribes of Persia move in great masses today as they did in the days of Abraham, moving flocks and herds in a constant search for grass, and continually striving with other tribes for water. A New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font10"> representative saw 30,000 Baktiari tribesmen and 250,000 animals ascend from their winter quarters on the Persian Gulf to the highlands, over roads that w’ere still covered with snow’ and ice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">These tribesmen 'and their families were barefooted and unprotected from the sun, wind and hail, yet not one of them caught a cold. The dust was unbelievably thick. The American marchers tied handkerchiefs over their noses and mouths, and even drank through handker-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">chiefs, as . the dus’f got info everything. The .whole Baktiari tribe take this trip every spring ..nd return to the Gulf in the fall. It is very hard to exercise any kind of government over people who live that kind of life. ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is no middle class in Persia, no engineers, no architects, and hardly any doctors. The mullahs or priests are the lawyers. Persia is divided into master and slave, landowner and landworker, aristocrat and peasant, oppressor and oppressed. Virtually all the nobles are government officials; and as there are not jobs enough to go around, they work one year and scheme for two more to get back into office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All of the original races of mankind are found in Persia. The frequent invasions from central Asia have left a strong element of the Mongols. The inhabitants of the hot lowlands in the southwest are Arabs, Semites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Persian aristocracy is not religious, but frankly and openly selfish, willing to sell out everything for the sake of being maintained in ease and affluence. The aristocrat is ceremoniously polite in the extreme. His speech has three forms of address, one for equals, one for ' superiors, and one for inferiors. Custom demands that they keep on their hats indoors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In Persia, when a man does not wish to see callers, his servants state that their master &quot;has gone within’, the exact contrary of the American foot at home’. When a high priest visits a town everybody who has a black suit of any kind puts it on. This shows that even the Devil has a lingering sense of the &quot;eternal fitness of things’, for surely nothing could be more appropriate than for a people to put on mourning when they see- one of the Devil’s own crowd headed their way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Persian Women</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Persian girl runs about for a few years draped in a long black cloth, but at 10 or 12 years of age is usually married to a man old enough to be her father. Meantime she has learned to help with the housework, to prepare meals, -weave, and wash clothes in the stream outside the town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Trial marriage is common. A Persian may have four legitimate wives, but he can enter into temporary wedlock, for a year, a month, a week, or even a couple of days. The mullah or priest fixes all that. Great are the uses of a priest!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">His principal job is to govern men through women.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is no furniture in the home. The -woman wears one dress day and night for a month, at the end of which time it is washed. Chairs are practically unknown in the Orient. Wherever a Persian woman goes she carries a mattress stuffed with cotton, on which she sits and rests during the day and sleeps at night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">An old Persian proverb says: “Woman is a great calamity. However, no household should be without this evil.” The Persian women must live in an inner courtyard, the anderoon, the only entrance to which is through the birooni, or men’s apartment. Persian women rise respectfully when their husbands or fathers enter the room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Persian veils his wife, so that none but he may see her charms, but in his absence his wife can go anywhere wrapped in her veil and he is none the wiser. Of late some of the women are appearing in the streets without their veils, but this is not safe in all Persian cities. Fanatics do not hesitate,in some places to attack or even kill women ignoring the teachings -of the Koran.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Persian kitchen is simplicity itself. Holes are dug in the floor alongside a wall. The pot containing the dinner is placed in a hole between two fires. The more dishes there are, the more holes there are. Refrigeration is unknown. Clocks are not used. The jangling telephone bell has only recently arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Life in the Cities</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Life in a Persian city is interesting because it is different. Only a few of the -streets in the capital, Teheran, 350,000 population, have any name. None of the houses have any numbers. Until three or four years ago none of the inhabitants had any family names. Then an edict required the adoption of family names, and there were some wonderful inventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The guardian of a gate gave himself the Persian equivalent of “Honest and Faithful”. A postman styled himself “Here, There and Everywhere”. A merchant chose as his name his telephone number, which happened to be “Three Hundred and Ten”; while a proud possessor of much livestock gave himself the euphonious and appropriate name of “Multitudinous Ass”. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The sick are treated by charms and prayers. A sick child may have tied around its neck the dried eye of a sheep, the kneecap of a wolf, .or the claw of a tiger. Or he may be treated by having him drink water in which lias been soaked a piece of paper -upon which a verse of the Koran has been written in Arabic. The mullah or priest attends to all that. Great are the uses of a priest ! A little later, no doubt, the priests will be blessing automobiles and airplanes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Persian boy dresses like a little old man, with long trousers and a long coat. At six or seven he is apprenticed to a carpenter, mason, tinsmith, carpet weaver or other tradesman, and must work ten to twelve hours a day while he is gradually learning the trade. Constant wearing of a hat, indoors and out, leads to early baldness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some new highways are being built, and motor cars are coming into use. Teheran is building new public buildings and lighting the streets, and hotels are coming into existence. Saloons and gambling houses have been closed. There are some newspapers, but they have to be careful what they print. If the editor pays too many compliments to Western civilization they lock him up; if he -is too hard on the westerners they lock him up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The sufferings of the poor in Persia deeply affect ^westerners, but the Persians are so accustomed to them that they think nothing of it. 'Among the poor the rooms of the houses are small and dark, and in wintertime the family is crowded together with no ventilation at all. Of course there is no pretension to hygiene, sanitation or cleanliness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Besides Teheran, with 350,000, there are Tabriz, 200,000; Ispahan, 80,000; Meshed and Kerman,, each 70,000; Barfrush, 55,000; Kermanshah and Shiraz, each 50,000; and about 25 other, cities of 30,000 and upward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Education, and Industry</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">During the last few years Persia has added to the 2,139 primary schools and 308 secondary schools of the old religious type, and 1,133 schools of the Western type, and new schools are being built as fast as the American and English universities at Teheran and Ispahan can prepare the teachers. There are over 750 Persian students studying in Europe, about half of them supported in whole or in part by Government funds. Radio is a government monopoly. The Germans are teaching the Persians scientific agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The game of polo originated in Persia. It died out for a century, but is now popular once more among the nobility. It is claimed that the fireworks displays of Persia are the most ingenious and dazzling to be seen anywhere in the -world. Persian artists are famous .for their </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font10">iature paintings, decorations of costly furniture, and illuminations of manuscripts. The secret of the peculiar’ Persian tinted and glazed pottery of the eighteenth century seems to have been completely lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The principal industry of Persia is, of course, as is -well known, that of rug making. Here the finest rugs in the world are produced under’ the most unspeakable conditions of poverty and wretchedness conceivable. The work is done in ill-lighted and ill-ventilated rooms by boys and girls who work from sunrise to sunset for a few cents a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Rugs yvere woven in Persia before the days of Alexander the Great. The making of them is a very slow but simple process. Generations of training have given the workers inherited taste and ability for the work, and their fingers seem peculiarly deft in manipulation. A girl -will have some part of a design as her peculiar portion and will almost automatically do the work a hundred or a thousand times in just the same way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Each region has a pattern 'different in main ground and border design, and sometimes in color scheme and -weave, from those of other districts. A person familiar -with Persian rugs can tell by looking at one just where it was made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Persia stands first in rug making, sending to the western markets more than three times the value of Turkey’s rugs. Nevertheless, the large trade is gradually lowering the standard of production, and it is claimed that in the museums of New York city there are to be found today Persian rugs of finer texture and appearance than any that could now be produced there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Finance and Transportation</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Up until -1911 most Persians who were in office looked upon the office as a chance to rob' the public and feather their own nest. Bribery and corruption were so rampant that at that time an appeal was made to America for help. W. Morgan Shuster and a corps of American assistants took charge, and in a .few months made such an excellent start that Britain and Russia, then 'dominating Persian affairs, became frightened, and brought about his removal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In 1922, Russian influence having in the meantime been overthrown, Persia again called upon America, and this time A. C. Millspaugh took charge . nd remained for five years, until such time as the Persians felt able to take up the work where he left off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Until recently transportation in Persia was limited to the mail coach. This is a simple rack wagon, without springs. It is loaded with mail sacks and the baggage of passengers. The passengers climb in on top of the. mail, trunks and boxes, and away they go. The coaches are drawn by four strong horses, changed at every relay station. It takes ‘weeks to go anywhere by camel caravan, and the camel as a means of transport is doomed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are fifteen regular trade routes, over which it is hoped some time to build railroads. One of these lines, from the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf, is now building, and is expected to be completed in 1937. It will be 1,200 miles long. Britain and Russia have held back Persian railroad building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In 1924 a weekly motor service was opened between Bagdad and Teheran. It takes three days to make the trip, with stops over night at two cities along the way. There is airplane service across the country in both, directions. Bicycles and motor cycles are much used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">From a study of Persia’s recent history it is plainly evident that in this part of the 'world 10,000,000 people have been retarded in their development by the devilish governments of Russia and Britain; and it is good to know that a better day is at hand, when the people will have a perfect Ruler and’know how to live.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">The doctor informed me that he had done a good deal of research 'work in connection with aluminum compounds but that his findings were not acceptable to the medical board in this center, so he was somewhat of an outsider on that subject.

If that seems ridiculous they cry that it is the labor that makes the bread expensive ; but that cannot be, because machinery does most of the work, and the value of production per worker has doubled since 1914. Meantime one of the baking concerns has increased its stock issue fortyfold, and if you v<sup>r</sup>ant to know the real reason why bread is kept high when the people are starving, that is it, But, anyway, &quot;white bread, is not fit for even a dog to eat; so the adherence to high prices accomplishes some good after all.

At the funeral a “frog” croaked from the text, “And a little child shall lead them.” Of course nothing whatever that would throw any light on the text, or any other text, was uttered in the palaver that followed. But custom requires certain formalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After the croaking was all over, recognizing the lady above mentioned as one of the Bible Students, but not knowing she was a relative, the blind-eyed rooster that had been airing his voice came up and said, “You must not go ahead of the mourners.” Barely restraining a smile the lady informed him of her relationship to the deceased. Nothing abashed, the empty popcorn bag said, “Well, don’t go ahead of the hearse. I will lead this procession.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then the lady wrote us a note about the matter and said that, thinking it all over, it is quite fitting that the preachers should head the funeral processions, and even go in front of the hearse, as is the custom, inasmuch as it is their father the Devil that has led the human family, to the grave.

However, when Romans grew rich and opulent and the lowly cabbage no longer appealed to them because of its simplicity, Greek physicians became the fashion; they practiced with strange herbs and occasionally with, drugs! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Strangely enough, the decadence of Rome commenced about this period. One can argue with, as much right as some present-day arguments are presented that Eome was great until the Romans gave up cabbage and undertook other treatments for disease. Inasmuch as the chief value of cabbage lies in the fact that it produces bulk and roughage. and when, eaten in sufficient quantity produces copious bowel movements, one might reasonably argue that Rome began to decay when constipation began to develop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Air, water, sunshine and food seemed to be enough for the man of olden times, yet we of today think that we’ve got to have surgeons, nose specialists, at least five drug stores per square mile and thousands upon thousands of medicines and chemicals to help us live. It doesn’t look reasonable to me. The travelers of today who have poked around in Africa, in the South Sea Islands, and in other more or less uncivilized sections of the world, find that the simple folk who live there seem to get along pretty well, without all our modern improvements and aids to health. As a matter of fact, Nicholas’Senn, the great Chicago surgeon, returned from, a world tour and said: “The only people I found on the face of the earth who are free from the degenerative diseases, apoplexy, cancer, etc., etc., are the savages.” When you take this man’s view or use your own gray matter, and study people, health and disease, you must, come to the same conclusion . . . any reasonable person would, . . . that wc live in spite of most of our health aids. There are about 250 diseases that we die from, and there are some 1,728 odd (listed) that we suffer from. The whole science of medicine can only boast of about six real cures, specifics: they are quinine for malaria, 606 for syphilis, diphtheria antitoxin for- diphtheria, unpolished rice for beri-beri. There may be a few others, and there may be still a few more that are likely some day to become a specific. However, at the most, there, are only twenty, and every one of these twenty is debatable. It is very doubtful whether 606 ever really cures syphilis. It is well knotvn that not all eases of diphtheria are cured by antitoxin and not all cases of malaria are cured by quinine. And even if they were all perfect, it would leave 1,708 diseases for which no specific cure is available. From this, I think that medicine has still a lot to learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The gullible public are herded into doctors’ offices for examinations, 50% of which are bound to be valueless and wrong, according to the only statistics extant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The worst part of this is that the so-called regular professions use poisons, drugs, and the knife to treat disease vnt.h, and if they are wrong 50% of the time in their diagnosis, it means 50% of the time they put the wrong poison in your body or cut out the wrong organ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The gall bladder is simply a little sac that accumulates bile from the liver. It saves bile to be used during a meal for purposes of digestion. If the gall bladder is enlarged, it must be enlarged because there is something wrong with the bile. Maybe there is too much bile; perhaps the bile is too hard. Now, let us remember what bile is. It is a chemical made by the liver. If the bile is of the wrong kind, then it is the fault of the liver, not the gall bladder. Now, why should the liver make the wrong kind of bile? Well, maybe the liver is out of order. Why should the liver get out of order? The liver has a number of things to do, one of which, is to neutralize waste materials and poisons in the body. All the venous or dirty blood is brought to the liver for cleansing. If the liver has to do too much of this sort of work, it may get overworked ; for instance, if a person is constipated and the intestine is filled with poisons and waste materials, the venous blood may pick up some of these. It brings them to the liver, the liver cleans them out, neutralizes them, changes them a little bit chemically and throws them back into the intestine by way of the bile; therefore gall bladder disease can often originate in constipation. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This peculiar doctor, who thinks and reasons, prescribes a treatment for the patient’s constipation. The biliousness and liver trouble that the patient had from constipation disappear. The liver is once more able to make the right kind of bile: the gall bladder is happy again because it is no longer being distorted by hardened or chemically changed bile; the patient gets well. He is $500.00 and one gall bladder to the good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another example: Most people know what goiter is, and have seen individuals around and about with an unsightly swelling of the neck. The average doctor who treats goiter either rubs iodine on it or something else; hitches the goiter up to an electrical machine, or, if he’s got nerve enough, cuts the goiter out. One man, Dr. Sajous, the world’s greatest expert on goiter, didn’t do things in this fashion. He, too, believed in treating- the patient and not the disease. In Switzerland, the most goiterous country in the world, he was called to study a certain section, where goiter was endemic, which means that almost everyone had it. He found that the people who lived in the valleys of this particular section were- the sufferers from goiter. Those -who lived farther up in the mountains didn’t have it. He determined to find out WHY. He reasoned that whatever was the cause, it must be a pretty general one. He hit upon the plan of investigating the water. He fed the water to a series of test animals and found that they developed goiter. He examined the water and found that it was contaminated with the waste material from, the bowels Of the people who lived higher up in the mountains. Their sewage was disposed of in such a fashion that the water which ran down the. mountain was contaminated. The people in the valley drank it. Sajous changed the water supply, he instituted sanitary measures, he cured goiter in tens of thousands of people. He returned to America, wrote of his experiences, advised physicians and the pupils in the college in which he taught (the University of Pennsylvania) that intestinal waste materials produced a poison which in turn produced goiter. He advised cleaning out the bowels of people who had goiter and seeing that their food sources were not contaminated. The next year one of the most famous clinics in the United States took out five thousand goiters surgically ; and so we learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The medical profession has made many mistakes, and they are making many more. Almost everyone knows that competent nursing is most important in the treatment of the s<sup>:</sup>-k. The nursing profession is the foundation of medical science of today. Yet the nursing profession, as we know it, only dates from around 1860. Before that the nurses were prostitutes, old women, scorned women and the dregs of humanity. They were kicked around by the medical profession and only tolerated by the sick people because of necessity. Florence Nightingale, an English woman with a heart and soul, heard of a German pastor who was training girls to be nurses. He taught them to be kind, to be clean, and he trained them in the fundamentals of anatomy and physiology. Florence Nightingale went to him, studied, and became convinced that the nursing profession was secondary in importance only to the medical profession. She went to the Crimean War and nursed the wounded and the sick. The doctors spat at her, clawed at her, and reviled her. She went back to England after the war and tried to establish a nursing school. The doctors fought her and even had her banished. Finally, the soldiers whom she had brought back to life, whom she had nursed and tended and whose wounds she had dressed, spread the news of her kindliness and efficiency to such an extent that the intelligent common people<sup>1</sup> of England demanded her return and honored her. Above the protests of the medical profession, nursing schools were inaugurated and nursing became an integral part of the art of treating. Can you imagine fighting the idea of educated trained nurses? Nobody but a doctor could think of such a thing!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A laxative or a purgative, no matter how mild it is, always produces injury to the membranes of the digestive system. The reason a laxative works is that it irritates. Anything which irritates a delicate membrane produces watering, just as a particle of dirt in your eye produces a copious watering. When you swallow a pill or take a medicine which has a laxative or a purgative action, the membranes of your stomach and intestines are irritated. They throw out great amounts of -water to wash the irritating substance away. They become inflamed. Because these purges produce a lot of water the intestinal contents are always carried away and the person has a watery, violent stool. Most people are satisfied with this result; they think they have cleaned themselves out. They go along with their same habits of eating; they do nothing whatsoever to cure the cause of their constipation; and whenever the occasion arises they take another pill. Very soon they find that they have to take a little more of the same pill or that it fails to work and they have to find a new one. And so the years pass and after a while they find that nothing works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">An enema consists of injecting into the bowel a liquid, usually water, to wash out accumulated wastes. The effect is immediate, waste materials are washed out, but there is not one iota of curative effect. Simply washing out stagnant matter from, the colon doesn’t restore the weakened muscles to their proper strength; it does not reach causes, and the result is that the enema user beeom.es a slave to a troublesome and harmful habit. I say harmful, because the enema, which has been regarded heretofore as an utterly harmless thing, has two very serious objections. Great amounts of water poured into the large bowel dilute the filth and wastes which may be found there, and the body immediately begins to absorb a certain amount of this dirty water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The result is that the enema taker usually feels worse immediately after an enema than he did before. His head may hurt; he feels toxic. It is the function of the large intestine to absorb the water from feces and make the liquid bowel contents into.a solid. The inevitable result of an enema must therefore be a flooding of the body with diluted but filthy sewage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The second objection to the enema is that ballooning out the lotver bowel with liquid (some people inject several quarts) stretches the muscles, takes the elasticity out of them and utterly weakens them. All surgeons are familiar with the dilated, toneless, flabby colon of the habitual enema user! An occasional enema may be all right, but the habitual enema is as distressing a habit as can be indulged in!</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font10"> crazy old crank nearly 600 years old, named Noe, is upsetting the whole world with predictions of a universal flood, which he avers will drown everybody and destroy all the magnificent works vre have, built up during the last thousand years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font10"> public meeting is hereby called to discuss the -whole and to take measures to allay the fears of the common people, who, though at first they failed to pay any attention to him, are now scared out of their wits on account of his having commenced to build a mammoth ship in which he and his family propose to take refuge from said flood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Accordingly, as the record proceeds, on Saturday, August 30, 2472 B. C., fifty-five thousand people assembled in the Convention Grove and the meeting was opened and its object discussed by the chairman, Perga the Perizzite, as follows :</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">My friends, you have known me for the past 457 years as a leader of the public in all good works, and that my sole object in life is to see you happy and prosperous, but if our prosperity is to continue we must at once take steps, peaceful if possible, but by force if not, to silence this malcontent Noe before he ruins the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I scarcely need to remind you of the trouble he has already brought about. Banks are failing in all directions, all confidence in our financial system has been destroyed, and a vast number of factories have closed down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Our farmers, whom we have always regarded as the backbone of the community, have suffered so from drought that many are on the verge of starvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is true we have considerable grain stored away in our granaries, enough for more than two years if we never raise another kernel, but so badly shaken is our financial system, by this</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">crazy old preacher, that our people won’t accept what they call an inflated currency, and everybody, including the Government, has hidden away the last grain of gold, which you know is our standard of value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With your permission, I shall call for a rising vote, to confirm my call on the Supreme Court for a writ of mandamus, compelling Noe to disclose where he is .getting the funds to build his’ 45,000-ton ship, and ask the judge to enjoin him from any further' pessimistic preachments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hardly had Perga taken his seat when the meeting was addressed by Phalec Olympus, a large wholesale and retail merchant who gave away more than ten million simoleons annually to send red flannel drawers to the heathen in Africa, besides having organized libraries in every village in Ethiopia, and who was quoted in the Bradstreet of that day as worth fifty billion gold talents and whose credit was AAAA 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Phalec reiterated all that his predecessor had said, but failed to disclose a little deal he had made in rubber, in Central Africa, which had netted him four and a half billions, and that he had six factories busy night and day making rubber coats and umbrellas and overshoes and gum boots for which Noe’s preachments had made a great demand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For five hours the people listened to speaker after speaker without coming to any definite conclusion as to what to do, when it was suggested that one of the Nephilim named Allaca-pone be hired to lie in wait for Noe as lie went home at night from his shipyard, and mow him down with a machine gun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At this juncture the clouds obscured the sun, and a slight drizzling rain commenced, which speedily cleared the field, and all betook themselves to shelter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The next morning the rain came down harder than ever, and only those possessed of good</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">rubber coats attempted to go to their offices and factories. Noe and his family were calling all the animals into the ark, and by noon they were all. comfortably settled, and though the ark had been constructed on a hillside, the tide rose sufficiently high by 8 o’clock that night for it to float, and off they sailed to the northeast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What happened subsequently can be read in the 22d verse of the seventh ..chapter of* Genesis, the first book in the Bible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font10">HIS article is not written for ^publication, but for the purpose of giving you the inside dope on the long-ranged guns used by the Germans, in the World War. In issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font10"> of April 16, page 456, you quote news item in regard to these guns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I presume it was from an article written by Prof. Miller, of the University of Michigan, as his article appeared in several of the leading newspapers and magazines of the country. To save time let us dispose of his article by calling attention to the fact that nowhere in his article did he tell how he obtained the knowledge of his detailed account of the long-ranged guns, when the facts stand out that the Allies never found hair or hide of these guns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The facts are that in the year 1901 the writer was granted a United States patent on the long-rang’ed shell used by the Germans. The secret of the long shot was not in the gun, but in the shell, though it is a fact that it took an extra heavy, long-barreled gun to properly handle the shell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I first tried to persuade the United States Government to take over and try out the invention, but, after a year or two of red tape, was notified that the idea was not practical. I then-wrote to the ambassador of France, with no results. I next wrote the German ambassador, who was an attache of the German navy, and who immediately understood the philosophy of the invention, and wrote me for full details, which rfurnished him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After an exchange of about four letters I heard no more from the German, but it was my thought and the thought of my friends that the German had tucked the plans safely away for</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">' have since received Mr. Pool’s permission to publish this letter, and have seen copies of correspondence and newspaper articles which support every statement herein made. There is no doubt in our minds that the “Big Bertha” originated in the mind of Mr. Pool, and the idea was developed and utilized by the Germans.—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Editor. </span><span class="font10">future use. I then began study on a yet more powerful weapon. But in the midst of my plans . I came in possession of the glorious message of the Kingdom, which banished all my military ambitions, and my hope was that my past efforts would be forgotten with the passing years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In 1901 the Kansas City </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font10"> published a picture and description of the shell. In short, the shell was a large shell, bored out at the point to receive a small shell with room for a powder charge behind it and a fuse connection from the powder chamber of the small shell back to the powder chamber behind the large shell. This connection was made by a small hole through the center of the large shell. When the small shell was in place it completed the point of the large shell, which then looked like one great shell. - ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When the gun was fired the fuse connecting the two powder chambers was ignited. As the large shell was speeding upward the time fuse was burning toward the powder chamber behind the small shell. At the time the large shell reached the crown of its curve, high up, ■where there was little air resistance, the fuse exploded the powder charge behind the small shell. The thought was that the small shell would leave the point of the large shell with about the same energy as though fired from the rifle, figuring the greater weight of the large shell together with its tremendous momentum; this with its great height and with little air resistance would carry the small shell an unheard-of distance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In 1917 the world was astounded by the fact that the Germans were dropping shells in Paris, a distance of 72 miles. Two years ago the Kansas City </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Star,</span><span class="font10"> while searching old files, ran onto the article and picture of my invention. They immediately called me by long distance phone, and wanted me to furnish them with the history of my invention. I finally agreed to do so, provider! they would let me tell my own story, which they agreed to do. I showed them by scripture, in a lengthy article, what it all meant and what the future had in store for the nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">While they treated me fairly In that they gave my views on war, they were careful not to quote one single scripture to prove where I got my views.</span></p>

From childhood I could feel his love in the songs of the little birds, and the sweet fragrance of the wild flowers that grew, by the roadside. I was reared in the midst of infidelity, but it never had any effect on me. My daddy was not a believer, but he taught us to always tell the truth and shame the Devil. Last year I lived near Sherman and had free access to the public library. I read over thirty histories on the Bible by different authors. Almost all of them .wanted to discard John’s gospel, and Second Peter, also part of Paul’s writings. They were all big 'doctors of divinity’, too. The last two books I read from the library were Judge Rutherford’s two books </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">'Life</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation.</span><span class="font10"> Oh, horv I enjoyed reading those books!

<p><span class="font10">Decided: Feb. 13th, 1931’ By the Court</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mock, J J.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Oscar Burke was found guilty in the police court of the City of Warren, under an affidavit that charged that he unlawfully went “about from place to place upon the streets of said city” to solicit orders for books without having obtained a license so to do, contrary to a given ordinance of the City. The judgment of conviction was affirmed in the Common Pleas Court and he now prosecutes error to this Court to reverse both of the judgments referred to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Burke had been arrested and fined $100 and costs and carried the case up. He made the claim that he was attempting to place a religious book in homes and not upon the streets. After the record was submitted to the court of appeals, the decision was given at once. The action of the police court was set aside as being against the weight of the evidence. It is reported that at the conclusion of the case, Burke presented each of the three judges with a copy of the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The following is the official decision of the Court of Appeals:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Ordinance invoked against the accused is not one of perfect clarity but we do not deem it necessary to place any interpretation on its terms. If Burke was soliciting orders for books at the time charged, the books which he sought to dispose of were of religious nature. Burke had no financial interest in the sale of them. It is agreed that under another section of the City Ordinance one soliciting orders of this character is immune from prosecution if his solicitation was in fact done for church or religious purposes. Whether the publishing house that furnished these books was conducting a business for profit is not apparent. It is, however, perfectly apparent that so far as Burke was concerned, he was engaged in a religious mission, that the work he was doing was solely of a religious nature and was for the benefit of the church with which he is affiliated. It is not therefore necessary to determine whether under this Ordinance he would have been guilty if he had been engaged in soliciting orders from which he was to profit. It is only necessary to say that the evidence clearly shows that he was entitled to immunity afforded him by the Ordinance last referred to. Because the judgment is manifestly opposed to the weight of the testimony the same is reversed.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Resurrection of ite Just and the Unjust</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A</span><span class="font10">MONG the most beautiful and hopeful doctrines of the Bible is that of the resurrection. Not only does it mean the awakening of the dead, but upon it rest all the blessings of the fullness of life for mankind. It means that those dear to our hearts will return with unending fellowship, gladness will replace the pangs of heaviness and sorrow, health will supplant sickness, the bloom and freshness of youth will dispel the marks of age and infirmity, abundant and everlasting life will replace the ravages of death and disease, and praises and love for the great Jehovah will repel all fear and misunderstanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Bible gives several accounts of the awakening of individuals who were actually dead; and this was accomplished by the power of God. You will recall the death and the awakening of the Shunammite’s son, as recorded in the fourth chapter of Second Kings; also the revival of Jairus’ daughter, in the ninth chapter of Matthew ; and the account of the awakening of Lazarus, as found in John the eleventh chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">While it is true that these individuals were temporarily revived, yet they did not receive that fullness of life and freedom from all imperfections that the Bible promises to those who will have part in the resurrection. The Greek word translated “resurrection” in our Bibles is </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">a-na-sta-sis,</span><span class="font10"> 'which means a revival to fullness of life, a raising to perfect life. While it is true that the awakening from the dead is an important step in the resurrection, yet there are additionally many imperfections, especially of mind and heart, that must be removed before perfect life will he enjoyed by the members of the human family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In considering this subject it is important at the outset to examine Jehovah’s provision for the accomplishment of this great work of revival, as well as the necessity of the resurrection. The broad application of the work of resurrection will increase our love and faith in the Creator. Finally we shall consider the blessings and responsibilities of those who will have part in the resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Necessity of the Resurrection</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">As</span><span class="font10"> we look about us on all sides we find that there is great necessity for the resurrection. We see the diseased and dying condition of our fellows. Man begins his downward course toward the grave even before lie is brought into the world. David under inspiration states, in Psalm 51: 5: “Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.” We find cripples; we find the traces of anxiety and sorrow marking the faces of the people; we find the race burdened with many cares; we find many forms of slavery. No human wisdom is able to cope with the present situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But why are these conditions prevalent in the earth? Why does not man continue to live? In answer to these questions, we must go back to the beginning of man’s deflection from the laws of his Creator, when he came under the sentence . of death and all his children were brought into condemnation. Back in the garden of Eden man had life and there was given to him the opportunity to live on earth forever provided he were obedient to the will of Jehovah, his Creator. A simple test of obedience was placed upon Adam, as stated in Genesis 2:16, 17: “Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good, and evil, thou shall not eat of it: for in the day that thou eat-est thereof thou shalt surely die.” Manifestly, the fruit of the tree was not poisonous nor imperfect; it was a creation of the Lord. The main purpose in making this statement to Adam was to try out the obedience of the first man. Obedience is the hardest lesson to learn. No creature in heaven or earth will- have everlasting life unless such a one is obedient to the will of the Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Over Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden was placed a caretaker, a covering cherub, whose name was originally Lucifer. The name Lucifer means the “bright shining one”; he was beautiful and knew the will of God concerning the first pair in Eden. It was his duty to guide the human race in truth and righteousness, that so mankind might bring honor and praise to Jehovah. Lucifer, however, was ambitious. Pride entered into his heart. Lucifer boasted and said in his heart, as stated in Isaiah 14:13, 14: “I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north. . . . I will be like the Most High.” While God told Adam that death was the certain penalty of disobedience, the enemy came to Eve in the guise of a serpent and suggested that she eat of the fruit. Eve replied to the serpent, “We</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.” To these words the serpent replied in subtle and haughty terms: &quot;Ye shall not surely die: for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.” Thus one of God’s favored agents betrayed his trust and brought man into disobedience and death. He became the father of lies, the Dewi, in the statement, “Thou shalt not surely die.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Of course after disobeying God the first pair were stricken in their consciences and were convinced of disobedience. They .knew good and also evil. This experience did not result to their benefit, but only to their injury. Let man ever keep in mind that the Creator so made him that man’s chief happiness is in obedience to the will of his Maker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Let it be remembered definitely that on account of Adam’s disobedience he came under the sentence of death. God did not say that eternal torment or hell-fire was the penalty for disobedience. In concluding the sentence against Adam, the angel of Jehovah, according to Genesis 3:19, stated: “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it w’ast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It was after the sentence of death had been passed upon Adam and after he was an imperfect and dying individual that he begat children. Of course, these children could not have perfect vitality. Like their father Adam, they must die. The whole race of Adam thus came under condemnation; for it was impossible for Adam to transmit perfect vitality to any of his offspring, as he did not possess perfect life himself. In accordance with this statement the Bible tells us, in Romans 5:12: “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.” Also in 1 Corinthians 15:22 we read, “In Adam all die.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">While we here recognize the statements of the Bible, it is held by some that when man dies a certain part of him called “the immortal soul” escapes and lives on forever. Such theory is entirely out of accord with the Bible and is based upon the lie that was told Eve in the garden of Eden and which the Devil has led mankind to believe. Such an idea is not only unscriptural but unreasonable. Such a theory 'would lead one to believe that a person when hit on the head with .a club becomes unconscious, yet not entirely dead, but if that same person were hit just a little harder he would become more alive than ever. Such conclusion is preposterous. We have several instances of persons who have been dead, some for hours, some for days, and yet were temporarily revived. None of such ever explained where they had been in the meantime. None of them gave an account of being in heaven or in purgatory, or in the torment of hell-fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Bible definitely informs us concerning the condition of the dead. In Ecclesiastes 9:5 we read: “The living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing.” In harmony with that suggestion, in Ecclesiastes 3:19 we read: “That which befalleth the sons of men be-falleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a, man hath no preeminence above a beast.” While it is true that man dies just as a beast, nevertheless Jehovah has made a provision for the return of man from the grave. Such provision has not been made for the animals. The New Testament is also in accord with the statements of the prophets. In John 3:13 we read, “No man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man.” Also, Jesus said, “Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear [the] voice [of the Son of man] and shall come forth.” (John 5: 28, 29) Jesus did not say that the dead were in heaven or purgatory or in hell-fire, but he truthfully said that the dead are in the graves. Let us keep in mind that between the time of death and the time of awakening in the resurrection, the individual is absolutely unconscious. He is not aware of the things that take place, and the moment of awakening will seem connected to the last moment when the individual had consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">That it is the soul that goes 'down to the grave and remains dead until the resurrection, there cannot be any doubt. Death brings about a reversal of the processes of creation. When man was created, it is written concerning him, in Genesis 2: 7, “The Lord God formed man of the 'dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a </span><span class="font11">living </span><span class="font10">soul.” By union of the body </span><span class="font11">®ade of final and</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">the breath which we breathe, in harmony with the power of God, man became a living, sentient creature, which is a soul. Death reverses this process. Man expires the breath of life which is the air common to all breathing creatures, and his body returns to the earth. David states, in Psalm 146:4, “His breath goeth forth, he re-turneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.” In Ezekiel 18:4 we read that “the soul that sinneth, it shall die”. In Psalm 89:48 we read, “What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Of course these statements may strike some as being entirely different from what they had been taught heretofore. But let all such honestly rejoice in the truth, because it always does a person much good to learn new things and put aside old doctrines when such learning improves his understanding and is in accord with that which is right. A wise man is willing to change his ideas and his course of action a dozen times a day if such changes are pleasing to Jehovah; a fool is conceited in his own ideas and will repel changes even when he recognizes such a course is right. The Scriptures are harmonious in the support of the thought that the resurrection is necessary to give man life beyond the grave. In 1 Corinthians 15:13 to 18 we read: “If there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. . . . Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.” The apostle here argues that without a resurrection our faith is vain, and that without a resurrection even the Christians, fallen asleep in Christ, would perish. In Psalm 16:10 we read: “Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell [the grave].” When David was at the point of death he said, according to Psalm 30, verse 3: “0 Lord, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As we review the dying conditions of mankind about us, as we trace man’s deflection from the laws of his Maker, and as we examine the Scriptures, we must conclude that the resurrection is necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Provision</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We are now in position to examine Jehovah’s provision for the resurrection of the human family. The motive that prompted Jehovah to make this provision was love for mankind. The goodness of Jehovah overshadows all his works. The basis for the provision of the resurrection was the gift of his dear Son, who was made a ransom for sin. In John 3:16 we read: “God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” But why should Jehovah give so costly a treasure? Why was it necessary for the perfect man Jesus to die? These are questions that are important in the consideration of the philosophy of the ransom. In answer to these statements we go back to the garden of Eden. Adam had been created perfect. Jehovah always creates things perfect. However, Adam was created with ability to choose that which is good and live, or to choose that which is evil and die. In the case of Adam, the penalty of disobedience was the death of a perfect man. It is written, “The wages of sin is death.” Since, therefore, it was necessary for a perfect man to die in order to release Adam and his children from the grave, it was impossible for any of Adam’s race to provide the ransom. The reason for this is that all of Adam’s children were imperfect. Hence, the psalmist states, 'no one is able to give a ransom for his brother.’ It was necessary for a perfect man to come into the world; this man must go down into death; and he must be raised from the dead in order to present the substitute for the penalty that was placed upon Adam for disobedience. The resurrection of this individual was necessary because the purchase price, the merit of a perfect man, must be presented in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Scriptures present this view of Jehovah’s provision. The Father of Jesus was not a descendant of Adam, for none of Adam’s descendants could give perfect vitality to a son. Jehovah was the Father of Jesus. To this the Scriptures abundantly testify. The mother of Jesus was Mary. While here on earth, Jesus never referred to Joseph or any other member of the human family as being his Father. He always referred to Jehovah God as his Father. In John 3:17 we read: “God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.” Again, in John 1:29, we read the words concerning Jesus at the beginning of his ministry: “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.” Again, in John 6: 39, 40, we read the words of Jesus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“This is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Furthermore, the Scriptures testify that it was necessary for Jesus to go down into death in order to satisfy the requirements for the release of the human family. In 1 Timothy 2:5, 6, we read that ‘'the man Christ Jesus gave himself a ransom for all’. In Bomans 5:8 we read that “God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died fo.r us”. Thus we see that it was necessary that nothing less than the death of the perfect man Jesus could meet the divine requirements for the liberation of the human family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It was necessary, furthermore, that Jesus be raised out of death by the power of God to present the merit of his perfect human life as the ransom for mankind. In accordance with this we read, in John 10:17,18, the words of Jesus: “Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.” While it is true according to the Scriptures that Jesus was resurrected a powerful spirit creature, yet thereafter he took up the value of his perfect humanity and presented it to the heavenly Father in behalf of mankind. We read in Hebrews 9: 24: “Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.” Thus we realize that the provision of Jehovah for the resurrection of the human race is entirely adequate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Broad Application of Resurrection</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We are now in position to understand the application of the text found in Acts 24:15: “There shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.” In this text the word “just” applies to all those who have been justified in the sight of Jehovah. This includes those •who, 'during this Christian age, have manifested faith until death in the precious blood of Jesus; who have 'determined to do God’s will and have been begotten by the spirit of Jehovah. It also includes the prophets of old who found favor in Jehovah’s sight on account of their faithfulness. According to the Scriptures (Rom. 3: 28) a man is justified by faith; the blood of Jesus is necessary in this justification (Rom. 5:9); and it is God who justifies the individual.—Rom. 8: 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">By far the greater number of the human family have not been justified. This includes all the heathen who have gone down to the tomb. It includes also by far the greater number of people in the civilized lands. Jehovah has promised that there will be a resurrection of both the just and unjust. This includes all. Let us note this difference: Those who are now.justified and have a knowledge of the truth are tested out at this time; they have their trial period in advance of the majority of mankind. On the other hand, the unjust will be brought forth from the tombs in the awakening, .and if obedient, will receive life everlasting here upon the earth. Jehovah will help all people to live in accordance with his will who long for righteousness and who wish to cooperate with the Creator in his purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On the one hand, therefore, we find that those who have been on trial during the Christian era and who will be faithful will have part in the first resurrection. In Revelation 20: 6 we read: “'Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.” The Apostle Paul also, in Hebrews 11:35, speaks of the faithful prophets as having part in a “better resurrection”. On the other hand, the words of Jesus assure us that all will be awakened from the tombs. In John 5: 28, 29 we read the -words of the Master: “The hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection [by judgment].” The latter part of this text makes a distinction between two classes: the first are the just, who enter into life in its fullness in the resurrection: the others enter into a resurrection by judgment. They will be put on trial to determine their faith and heart loyalty to the Creator. Thus we see that Jehovah has made provision for every individual to have life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Blessings</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The blessings of those who have part in the resurrection will be manifold. The obligation</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">will be obedience to the will of Jehovah and his arrangements. Those sharing in the first resurrection will be joint-heirs with Christ Jesus and will compose the kingly, ruling class of the kingdom. Those having part in the first resurrection, according to 2 Peter 1: 3, 4, will have the divine nature, which is the highest order of spirit existence. They will be powerful creatures and will be used by Jehovah as the favored agents in accomplishing his great work in the future. The kingdom class, or those who rule, will have given up their earthly bodies of flesh and the privilege of living on earth. The divine nature gives them more power and efficiency in accom-■ plishing the work of the Creator. In 1 Corinthians 15: 50 we read that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. In meekness and amidst much persecution these Christians are bow being tested as to their devotion to the Lord. In the resurrection they will be raised in kingly glory by the power of Jehovah. In Matthew 5:3 we read: “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A kingdom would be incomplete unless there were subjects in the domain. Even so in the Lord’s arrangements, the billions of mankind will be brought forth from the tomb. They will have the privilege of knowing the Lord, of working in accordance with his will, and if completely devoted to his cause, will be given everlasting life upon the earth. In Isaiah 35, verse 10, we read that “the ransomed of the Lord shall return [to return means, of course, to come back to earth where they have been before], and come to Zion [God’s organization] with songs, and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away”. Concerning the heathen, including the Sodomites who were destroyed with fire, and the wayward people of Samaria, the Bible states definitely that they shall all return to earth. In Ezekiel 16:55 we read: “When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate [their former estate was the earth, and they will return to this planet], and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou [meaning the Jews] and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the kingdom, which is the principal thing for man, God will bring about the solution of man’s problems. We are told that wars will cease and that each' man who is obedient will have his own home and provisions. In Micah 4:3-5 we read that the nations “shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up a swox'd against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it. For all people will walk every one in the name of his - god, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We read about the blessings and joy of the kingdom that are promised to mankind, in Revelation the twenty-first ■ chapter, verses three to five: “I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new.” Thus we see how important the words of Jesus are when he said, “Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In reviewing this subject, we recognize the necessity of the resrirrection. As we examined the Scriptures w<sup>r</sup>e found that Jehovah has abundantly provided for man’s revival and everlasting happiness. We have also recognized the love and justice of the heavenly Father in a resurrection of both the just and the unjust. The resulting blessings of the regenerated race of mankind evoke our acclaim and praises to the Giver of all good things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As we witness reorganized society lifted from death to the fullness of life, we see a, new race marching before our eyes. Their faces are no longer marred with the cares of sorrow and disease, but they reflect the gladness and joy which has been planted in. their hearts by the Creator; no longer do we see cripples, the maimed and the halt, but people of buoyant step and stately bearing; no longer do we find nations and peoples separated by hatred and misunderstanding, but arm in arm they go united with one purpose to the praise of Jehovah and concerned for the other’s welfare and happiness; they sing as they </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">go,</span><span class="font10"> and that song is untainted by malice and fear; they sing of the goodness of their Maker and of his works and power. This new race mark’s Jehovah’s work in the earth complete. They reflect all praises and glory to his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Why Not Import Some Irishman?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">B</span><span class="font10">IG- BUSINESS has sung and whistled and preached it all over the United States that there is not a man in their crowd that is honest enough to run the Muscle Shoals power plant in the interest of the American people; and no doubt they are quite right. Their record would seem to justify all this pessimism on their part. But neither they nor the rest of America should be at all dismayed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Granting the premise that the Big Business bunch are so congenitally crooked that they can not or will not' make a success of the Muscle Shoals plant, and that we cannot find anybody else in America who can do- it, why not go to Ireland and get somebody who can do it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Irish have opened their Shannon River power plant. Foreign experts thought it would take three years to develop consumption for so great an amount of power as was thrown upon the market fifteen months ago, but now it is all being taken. Good for Ireland ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now if Ireland has an honest man who can take a big potver plant like the River Shannon project and make a success of it for the Irish people, why can we not afford to set aside all immigration restrictions and let such a man come over here? It is certainly worth trying. Such a man might teach some of our Big Business apostles something of the rudiments of honesty. ,</span></p>
