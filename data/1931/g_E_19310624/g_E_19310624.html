Y., Wednesday, June 24, 1931 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number 307</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Whales and Whaling</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE whale is a cetacean. That is to say, he is a marine mammal, breathing by means of lungs. The cetaceans bring forth living young, which they suckle for some time. The anterior limbs are paddles. The tail flukes are horizontal. The dolphin, the porpoise, the grampus and the manatee, or sea cow, are all cetaceans, as well as the whales.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are two grand divisions of whales: baleen, or whalebone whales, and those that have teeth. The baleen whales go by different names, Bowhead, Arctic, Greenland, Right. Instead of teeth they have plates er blades of whalebone from two feet to twelve feet long and sometimes a foot wide, attached side by side along the upper jaw, and forming a fringelike sieve by which the food is retained in the mouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a baleen whale goes cruising along through the waters he opens his mammoth mouth and every day swallows several tons of tiny crustaceans and other minute sea organisms. These catch on the fringe of their baleen (whalebone) and are sucked down continuously, while the salt water filters out again through the corners of the mouth. The throats of baleen whales are small, never more than eight inches in diameter and sometimes not half that. It was not a baleen whale that swallowed Jonah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There was a time, a hundred years ago, and even less, when whalebone was an important</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">article of commerce; but changing feminine fashions and the introduction of flexible steel for umbrellas and corsets have made it less used than formerly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are baleen whales, like the Sulphur-Bottom of the Pacific, which attain great size, and then others, like those in New Zealand waters, may be as short as fifteen to twenty feet. Right whales, as baleens are called, are slow of movement and easily caught. The earliest whaling operations were confined to whales of this class.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Gray Whale and His Terrible Enemy</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It isn't all fun being a whale and cruising around swallowing baby mackerel by the ton. The gray whale has an awful enemy, the killer whale, the terrible and ferocious tiger of the seas. Although this species attains to but thirty feet in length, it will attack anything that swims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The gray whale can navigate but about six to eight miles an hour, and, when a killer whale arrives, becomes absolutely paralyzed with fright. It turns over on its back, with flippers outspread, and lies helpless at the surface. On comes the terrible killer at full speed, puts his nose against the gray whale’s lips, forces its mouth open, sticks his head inside, and with his mighty teeth, set in both jaws, bites out the gray whale’s tongue. Of thirty-five gray whales examined, seven had had their tongues eaten to a greater or less extent by these frightful savages of the seas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The whalers are glad when a school of killer whales locates a school of gray whales and they themselves happen to be in the vicinity. The gray whales are thrown into such a panic that the men have no difficulty in capturing them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is said that the thresher shark, also called the sea fox, sometimes uses its whiplike tail to flog a whale to death. The so-called white whale is not really a whale, but a variety of porpoise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Homely Humpback</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We can’t all be good-looking, and it seems that it is that way in the whale family. The humpback has a big, flat, massive head, but his total length is only about fifty feet. The anterior portion of his body is quite slender, for a whale, and at the same time so irregularly shaped, and so peculiarly joined to the thorax, that the animal appears misshapen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But the humpback has his strong points. In the first place, he is good to eat. The Japanese hunt him for food. In the second place, he is a savage fighter; and you can’t help but respect</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">him for that. The old-time whalers let the humpbacks alone, but the modern ones take everything. The humpback would sink when killed, and hence could be hunted only in shallow water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The greyhound of the seas is the razorback or finback whale. These used to be found in great abundance off the New England coast. Shooting them from tugs and steamers was a regularly organized business. A rorqual, as this whale is also called, will make thirty miles an hour. It is one of the largest of the whales, sometimes attaining nearly 100 feet in length. It has a dorsal fin and strong longitudinal folds on the throat and belly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Antarctic or blue whale is the largest living animal on the globe. It has been known to measure 115 feet. Such a whale contains 250 barrels of oil, worth about $30 a barrel. When frightened or wounded a blue whale has been known to travel fifty miles an hour. After being wounded one of these monsters will tow a killer boat for several miles at a dizzy pace even when her engines are going astern at eight knots an hour. The capture of these monsters has been possible only since the invention of the harpoon gun. Blue whales are found in pairs; finbacks, in packs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Cachalot, or Sperm Whale</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The cachalot or sperm whale has on the top of its head a large cavity containing the oily fluid which after death concretes into a whitish crystalline substance called spermaceti. It has a head of enormous size. The upper jaw is destitute of teeth. This ’whale sometimes grows to the length of eighty feet. It is found in the warmer parts of all the oceans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has been conjectured that the sperm whale may have been the great fish which the Lord prepared to swallow Jonah. Its throat is large enough that it could swallow a piano. When mortally wounded a sperm whale has been known to disgorge chunks of cuttlefish six feet long by four feet in width. The spermaceti organ, ■which lies above the skull, contains as much as fifteen barrels of oil. The head of the sperm whale makes up one-third to two-fifths of the entire creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The sperm whale is the only one of the species that suffers from indigestion, and this lends support to the thought that it was this type of great fish that was so uneasy after taking Jonah aboard. Ambergris is never found in healthy whales. It is produced only in the intestines of the sperm whale. Sometimes it forms so rapidly as to clog the intestinal tract and the whale dies. Then he becomes a gold mine to his discoverers. Ambergris is used as a fixative of the most delicate perfumes: it causes them to last. It is worth as much as $20 an ounce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Good-sized Babies</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The whale mating season is in June or July, and near the equator. The period of gestation is believed to be ten months. A whale baby may be twenty-one feet long when it is born, which is some baby. The mothers nurse the cute little things for five or six months, and'when they attain a length of forty-five to forty-eight feet they are heartlessly weaned and straightway have to shift for themselves. After that they grow more slowdy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The whale has its young once in two years, and it takes another two years for the young to reach maturity. Like our friend Warren G. of Teapot Dome fame, the bull whales are said not to be as faithful to their life companions as they might be. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whales are warm-blooded, as are all mammals. The blubber or fat acts as a nonconductor to keep the huge creature warm and comfortable in the cold ’waters of the seas in which he delights to sport, and where he obtains his food. His hide is without scales. His head contains four chambers, while that of a fish contains but two. He has lungs instead of gills. His front legs, toes and all, are enveloped in sacs and are called flippers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Greenland wfliale is believed to descend to 800 fathoms below. The reason for thinking this is that in very deep waters a very long line is required, while in shallo’wer waters a much shorter line will do. Sometimes, when wounded, a whale strikes bottom so hard as to kill it, and has to be hauled up dead. Others claim that the whale could not survive a descent below 100 fathoms (600 feet), on account of the terrible pressure to which he would be subjected, but it is hard to get around the long rope argument. Only the whale and his Designer know the truth about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Wonderful Lung Structure</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The One who built the first whale knew what He was doing. The cell structure differs mate-, rially from other mammalian lungs. In the whale lung there is much more smooth, involuntary muscle, and the cartilaginous rings 'which support the bronchial tree are much more numerous and extensive than in the air passages of other mammals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the whale is at a low ocean depth the increase of pressure on him enables him to utilize the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">oxygen</span><span class="font5"> in his lungs down to perhaps one percent. It is also inferred that the oil and fat of the whale aid in absorbing the carbon dioxid from his blood. Otherwise it is not knowm how it is possible for one to remain under water for nearly an hour, as some of them evidently do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A whale will, without even pausing to take a deep breath, plunge beneath the waves and be gone for a long time. When &quot;wounded he dashes about in a frenzy which would, theoretically, consume oxygen at a terrific rate. The carbon dioxid created must be stored somehow, and the oil and blubber no doubt has something to do with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When a whale comes up to breathe he does not rise vertically, but obliquely. His first act is one of respiration. The heavy condensation of air and moisture brought about by his long stay under the water at great depths is blown out through his one nostril, located in the top of his head. This blowing can be heard for half a mile and can be seen for some distance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whales do not spout water. They forcibly expel from their lungs the air taken in at the last inspiration, which is highly charged with watery vapor in consequence of the natural respiratory changes. This, rapidly condensing in the cold atmosphere in which the phenomenon is generally observed, forms a column of ‘steam’ or spray, which the spectator mistakes for water. But as the whale blows just as he comes to the surface, some water is inevitably mingled with the blast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The whale’s vision is not so good, and he depends for safety mostly on the organs of hearing. These are located on the sides of the head, three or four feet behind the eyes. A whaler’s engines must run very smoothly and, as nearly as possible, at uniform speed. Any sudden change in a ship’s speed will frighten whales in the neighborhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The whales prefer the colder waters. It is a whaler’s adage that “no ice, no whales”. This is true of the mackerel and other fish upon which the whales feed. By September the whales appear in the Antarctic, and leave for the west coast of Africa in May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Some Whaling History</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Northmen, i.e., the Norwegians, were the first ones in the whaling business; and they will be the last ones, for it is on its last legs. The whales have been nearly all destroyed. King Alfred, whose reign ended more than a thousand years ago, wrote of the whaling adventures of Othere, the Norwegian viking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the eleventh century the Basques were pursuing the Eight whale with harpoons, in open boats. It is even claimed that they visited the shores of Newfoundland in search of their prey, and it is known that they visited those waters immediately after the discovery of America. The Basques became familiar with the whale in their own home waters of the Bay of Biscay. Their industry reached its highest point in the thirteenth century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the sixteenth century Holland and England were rivals for the whaling business of the waters off Spitzbergen and Greenland. During the decade 1699-1708 the Dutch equipped no less than 1,652 vessels and captured between 8,000 and 9,000 whales.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the beginning of the nineteenth century the supremacy shifted to America. By 1690, and as long as whale oil was the world’s recognized illuminant, New Bedford, Massachusetts, was the whaling capital of the world. Now it is only a memory, as such. Prior to the Revolutionary War there were 308 American vessels hunting whales in the Atlantic; by 1848 they were in Bering Strait. In 1846 the American whaling fleet consisted of 722 vessels, claimed by 34 ports. This was the golden era of American whaling. In 1854 there was a peak production of 12,000,000 gallons of blubber for the whale oil lamps which one can find today only in antique shops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A Dangerous, Exciting Business</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The old-time whaler was a little wooden sailing vessel which went to sea for two to four years on a trip. The whales were hunted with man-powered boats. The old harpoon was a piece of tough steel, fastened to a long wooden shaft for throwing purposes. The whale boat was rowed right up to the whale, and one or more harpoons were hurled into his side. It required an alert and powerful man to make a sure hit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The line attached to the harpoon was coiled in tubs in the bottom of the boat, and whizzed out at terrific speed. If a sailor was caught in the line he seldom lived. When the line ran out the tub was thrown overboard and the crew waited for another chance to harpoon the animal. Boats were often upset, and men lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An infuriated whale would often deliberately attack a small boat and, with the vessel caught in its jaws, the sailors were either drowned or wounded. James Bartley, an English sailor, was actually swallowed by a sperm whale in February, 1891, near the Falkland Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The crew of Bartley’s ship had captured a large sperm whale. After the attack Bartley could not be found. Sailors worked a day and a night removing the whale’s blubber. On the second morning they hoisted the stomach on deck. Something in it gave spasmodic signs of life. They found it was Bartley, doubled up and unconscious. He was a raving maniac for two weeks, but eventually recovered his usual health. His skin was bleached to a deadly whiteness by the gastric juices and became like parchment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Afterwards he remembered being thrown out of a boat into the sea and. slipping along a smooth passage, yielding a slimy substance that shrank from his touch. The heat was terrific, but he could breathe. He became weak and sick, and the next thing he knew he was in the captain’s cabin. His skin never recovered its natural color.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Hard, Difficult, Disagreeable Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Few people except the Norwegians can stand the fatiguing, harassing, disagreeable work that falls to the lot of the whaler. There is probably no regular line of work that is so unremitting in its toil, so uncomfortable, and so dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The whalers spend their summers on their little farms in Norway. In the latter part of July or the first of August they leave home, to be gone until the next spring. A month or six weeks is spent in going to the other side of the world, to Tasmania, New Zealand or Uruguay, where the small boats, 120 tons register, 120 feet long, have steam up awaiting them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For the next five months they live in the roughest seas in the world, and in the most uncomfortable boats, for a whaler has no keel. It must be able to follow the whale and change its direction in a hurry. There is scant time to eat or sleep. The food is all canned stuff. The work is cold, greasy and disagreeable. The odor is disgusting. Yet every year large numbers of college men are eager to have a share in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The attempt to have a church at one of the land stations in South Georgia was abandoned. The men were willing to come ashore to see the movies twice a week, but not to attend church. The dominie gave it up as a bad job and pulled stakes for Norway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the time the whaling starts there is but one theme, and that is to catch as many whales as possible, get the oil out of them and get a full cargo in the least time, and get back to Norway. As a consequence, as there is no darkness in the land of the midnight sun at the bottom of the world, the work goes on unremittingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The greatest adventures of today are not with the whales, but with the Antarctic ice. The bergs sometimes are miles long and three thousand feet high. Sometimes a chaser is sunk and the men may make their escape only in their underclothes. Sometimes the chasers have to let go of whales they have already caught. At the close of the season there is danger of being caught in the drifting pack ice and not being able to get out at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Every Whale a Gold Mine</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A big whale may have a value of $10,000, but he may be worth much more than that. A single lump of ambergris, weighing 926 pounds, was valued at $135,000; and of course this came from a single whale, a very sick one. But whalers cannot depend on finds of ambergris, except rarely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The principal value is in the oil. There are several different grades. The finest blubber oil is a pale yellow, with a faint fishy odor. This is used primarily in cosmetics. The flesh and bones yield bone oil, and the lowest grade of all is used for lubrication purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A good part of our soaps, and all our shaving creams, come from whales; and if we eat margarine, much of that uncertain compound may come from the whale, too. Most glycerine is made from whale oil, and it is used in currying leather, oiling woods, and batching flax, jute and other fibers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The production of guano, bone meal and flesh meal is of great value. Flesh meal makes up into cattle cake, an excellent food for fattening</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">..... cattle. Guano is the meat of the whale, generally the residue of distillation, which goes through a process of drying and disintegration and is mixed with crushed bone in the proportion of two parts flesh to one part bone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whalebone is worth $5 to $7 a pound. From the whale’s hide are made large quantities of heavy belting, besides a quantity of boots, shoes, shoestrings and leather findings. Nothing is wasted, and science is constantly finding new uses for this rapidly vanishing animal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A big whaler may have 200 men in its outfit and may kill a dozen whales a day and turn them into oil. The captain may get as much as ~ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$25,000 for a season, while a mere deckhand,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">receiving as his share of the profits half a cent to a cent a barrel, may get as much as $1,800. The companies that send out the whaling outfits have sometimes made 100 percent profit a year. The total annual value of the business is around $40,000,000. A single ship Jias been known to bring in $3,000,000 worth of oil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Reeking with disgusting, nauseating odors, the Norwegian whaling fleet, when it returns from the Antarctic, is the most evil-looking and evil-smelling denizen of the seven seas; but with millions of dollars’ worth of cargo, all hands can afford to smile as they come back to civilization, for they have what the world is mad after, wealth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Modern Whaling Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Modern whaling began about 1870, with the invention by Svend Foyn of the harpoon gun. Following this invention each whaling field has had a run of a few years, when all the whales were killed off and the business was transferred elsewhere. It is now confined largely to the Antarctic, which is bound to be its last stand, as all the other regions have been worked out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A whaling outfit now consists of a floating factory (which is really an airplane carrier in disguise, and quickly convertible into one) and a half dozen or so of the actual whale chasers. There are also shore whaling stations at Deception Island, South Georgia, and in the South Shetlands. When the whalers return in the summer the first duty of the 150 men who constitute the shore staff is to free the sheds and flensing platforms of the accumulated snow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the bow of each whale chaser is the invention which is putting an end to the whaling business. The harpoon gun is a muzzle-loading cannon, mounted on a swivel. It shoots a hand-forged harpoon of Swedish steel, about six feet long, and weighing 120 pounds. Set in the harpoon’s end are four twelve-inch barbs which spring out at45-degree angles when the harpoon is lodged in the body of the whale. In the harpoon point is a 28-pound bomb charged with gunpowder, automatically fired three seconds after the shaft leaves the cannon. By a later device a light cable is attached to the harpoon and the whale is electrocuted as soon as it is hit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lars Andersen, foremost whale gunner in the world, has a guaranteed income of $40,000 a year. It requires an unusual man to aim a harpoon gun at a whale from a notoriously unstable craft, plunging about in the world’s roughest seas, at the exact moment the whale rises to the surface for air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To the harpoon shaft is attached a rope which passes over a roller and is connected with a powerful winch. The struggling whale is slowly brought up to the chaser and dispatched. Air is pumped into its body, so that it will float. A flag is stuck in it as a marker, and the chaser goes after another -whale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Floating Factories</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The little old wooden whaler used to flense the whales alongside, consuming several days in the operation. The modern flensing factory hauls the whale aboard through a door in the bow and cuts it up in two hours. The flensers slice through the blubber the length of the body. A winch is attached to each strip and peels off the outer coating as one would peel an orange. The flesh and bones are torn apart by machinery and fed into the boiling pans so that every part is utilized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Norway sends out thirty-nine of these floating factories, with some 200 of the chasers and nearly 10,000 men. They bring back about 70,000,000 gallons of whale oil. The whaling capital of the world is the little Norwegian town of Sandefjord on the Oslo Fjord. Here is published the Register of the whaling fleet of the world, and here are the headquarters of the Association of Norwegian 'Whaling Companies, John Rasmussen, ship-owner, chairman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The whaling equipment is now stiffened by the use of airplanes, equipped to land on the deck of the mother vessel, on the ice, or on the water. The Germans are figuring on using airships and dropping bombs. Everything in dicates that the days of the whale are numbered. He cannot compete with man’s scientific equipment for taking his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Extermination Is Near</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the last season there were forty-two whale factories in Antarctic waters, and associated with them were 250 chasers. There was thus a cordon of chasers around the entire Antarctic continent, located only fifty miles apart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the season 1925-1926, during the months November to March, when the whaling season is on, there were taken out of the Antarctic 793,790 barrels of whale oil. It is very doubtful if the whales could survive even such a catch as that, but in 1929-1930, with the whales hardly a fourth as numerous, the more efficient methods of slaughter resulted in bringing out 2,447,690 barrels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was estimated that in 1925-1926 there were at least 30,000 whales destroyed, as many that are killed are not recovered, so that it is likely that something like 120,000 perished in the season of 1929-1930. Realizing that the business is: at an end the old-timers are going after the remnants harder than ever, so as to have a share in the last of the profits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whales have been practically exterminated in the Northern Hemisphere, and it looks now as if tw’O years more will see the termination of -what, in its day, was one of the most thrilling and dangerous occupations of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The British and Norwegian governments are trying to do something to restrict whaling operations, but it seems a difficult task. It has been decided that whale cows with calves are to be protected. The practice of paying whaling crews according to the number of whales taken must be discontinued, and all parts of the animals containing oil must be utilized. Illegal catches are subject to confiscation. Each whaling captain must now keep a record of the number, kinds and location of his catches.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Professor Laski on Democracy</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5">N AN address before the Foreign Policy Association, Harold J. Laski, professor of political science in the University of London, expressed the opinion that there is no case for democracy that can stand investigation for ten minutes, and no alternative that can stand for five minutes. It is his opinion that the supposed practical qualities of business men are most impractical, and that they do not know how to bring about a stable society. He might have added that they are wrecking the one we do have. And we can add to it all that man has but one hope, and that hope is God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">What Milk Did to the Rats</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5">N THE Bureau of Home Economies, Washington, six white rats as soon as weaned were put on a diet of lean beef, potatoes, whole wheat, butter, sugar, salt and all the water they could drink. In five months they gained sixty grams. Six other rats of exactly the same age and parentage were given the same diet, plus all the milk they wanted to drink. In the same five months they grew 206 grams, which is more than three times the growth measured by the first group. The difference in growth is attributed to the calcium in the milk; and, incidentally, this shows why it is that children need fresh milk, and plenty of it, if they are to grow.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font5"> GERMAN who could have been in better business has invented a scheme of grinding apples to a powder and then pressing the powder into blocks. His idea is to make us eat one of these tablet things instead of eating a nice apple. He says it is all the same thing; but it isn’t. The skin is gone, the cider is gone, the core is gone, the crunch is gone, and even the worm is gone; and how could it be the same ?</span></p>

That is to say, the man that used to be the milkman now handles frozen orange juice, and the custom is growing rapidly. It is only a step from orange juice to other fruit juices, and the man that used to be the milkman is the logical one to leave these products at the door.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">B</span><span class="font5">RITAIN still imprisons for debt: not the rich debtor, however, for he can free himself by going bankrupt; but the poor debtor, unable to withstand the temptation of credit. Concerning this subject Sir Robert Parry says, in the Manchester </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When in 1869 imprisonment for debt was abolished for the well-to-do it was deliberately retained and not abolished for the poor debtors, under ‘a saving power of committal for small debts.’ Lord Brougham protested against a debt’s being treated as a Crime to be punished at the will and pleasure of a creditor; but that remains the law today—for the poor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">TT IS good news that the tsetse fly, which has depopulated large portions of Africa, has at last been conquered by the close observations of a naturalist. This man noticed that the fly is nervous, darting first to a shady place and then to one of bright light. This has been the fly’s undoing. A trap has been constructed which meets the conditions perfectly. The fly dashes into its shade, and then a hole in its roof leads him a moment later into the trap proper, where he beats himself to death against the bars of his cage. The device works perfectly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Europe?s Twelve Republics</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">INCE the World War Europe has had twelve new republics, Russia, Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Estonia, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Turkey, Greece, and Spain. It also had during the war France, Andorra, San Marino, Switzerland, and Portugal. It is significant that in Spain one of the first rules of the new- government was that the governors of the different provinces must keep away from church. The grandees of the Spanish nobility fled with Alfonso into France. They all instinctively feel that they have been part of a great fraud upon the people and that the people would be better off 'with them somewhere else. The priests were told that they must keep their mouths shut; that is just a way of saying that church and state have been separated. The Vatican took the hint and stated that it was not specially interested in the monarchy and is indifferent as to the kind of government the people of Spain choose. It has since recognized the Spanish republic. This must have been a bitter dose for it to svvallow<sup>7</sup>, as Alfonso was one of its prime supporters.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">HE owmer of a ‘water company in California, realizing that many of her company’s consumers were out of work or had suffered cuts in wages, made application to the public service commission of California to reduce the water rate while the present depression is on. This is exactly the opposite of the course being pursued by'water, gas and electric companies in the East, nearly all of -whom, right in the face of the hardest times the country has ever seen, have been raising the rates to the poor (by means of service charges) while reducing them to those who could afford to purchase more of w-hat they have to sell. Probably nothing more contemptible in history can be found than the practice of the public service companies in the East in their treatment of the poor.</span></p>

The dominie, that is, the justice, that is, the majesty of the law, took the money. When did one of them ever refuse it? Then the dominie, that is the justice, tried to obtain $30.60 in fine and costs, and finally offered to take over the radio set owned by the father of the kids, but explained that he would not tell anybody where he got it.

<p><span class="font5">EWSPAPERS are admitting that they are suffering badly from the competition set up by radio broadcasting. By means of the latter the public are now given news items, editorials, special features and advertising, besides some forms of entertainment and music which, in the nature of things, cannot be provided by the press. If, in the day of its power, the press had stood for the truth and for the interests of the common people, newspapers would not now<sup>7 </sup>be in the predicament in which they find themselves. One publisher recently closed his broadcasting station, because he found it was taking business away from his newspapers. In 1930, 107 leading radio advertisers cut their newspaper appropriations 12½ percent below those in 1929, while increasing their radio expenditures 63 percent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Changing Structure of industry</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">U</span><span class="font5">NDER the above subhead, in his little tencent book, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The New Capitalism and The Socialist,</span><span class="font5"> Harry W. Laidler plainly shows us the drift of all industry toward some form of socialism. The book is published by the League for Industrial Democracy. In the section which interests us most he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The new capitalism is also developing certain novel kinds of industrial relationships, as that between the various units of the General Motors, relationships which render it possible to bring under one unified control a vast industrial empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The General Motors, for instance, has under its control numerous huge plants for the manufacture of the Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Oakland, Buick, LaSalle, Cadillac, etc.; for the production of General Motors Trucks, Yellow Cabs and coaches, of Fisher bodies, of various automobile accessories, of the electrical refrigerator, Frigidaire. It controls numerous credit, sales. and realty corporations. It manages a great aircraft industry and a radio industry. It owns timber tracts and saw mills. It employs something like $50,000,000 in overseas operations in assembly plants and in merchandising operations. It centralizes a number of activities for the purposes of producing economies, at the same time administering its separate automobile subsidiaries as self-contained units, “headed by an executive who has full authority and is responsible for its individual operation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Ford Company, the other giant in the automobile field, is likewise illustrative of the newer trend. Here may be found under one corporate roof nearly twoscore plants in the United States and several abroad. The Ford Company owns a fleet of boats, possesses nearly half a million acres of timber and ore land' in upper Michigan, operates coal mines in Kentucky and West Virginia, railroads, tractor and aeroplane plants and great research laboratories. In the Highland Park plant alone there are a dozen departments which, if set apart by themselves, would make sizable industries. The radiator department, for instance, is capable of producing more radiators than all other radiator manufacturers combined. The spring, axle, or steering gear departments, if freed from Ford production demands, could supply the balance of the entire automotive industry. Here also are extensive glass and leather plants, a department where Fordite, a rubber compound, is made and a textile factory which weaves cloth on its own looms, as well as numerous retail stores for the Ford workers. Indeed, this huge establishment possesses the aspect of a small American city. In years gone by one of the chief objections to socialism was that public industry would be so unwieldly that it would fall of its own weight. The great billion-dollar combinations of the present day prove that far vaster aggregations of capital can be controlled by one corporate unit than was formerly deem ed possible. Thus another anti-socialist contention may be—at least in considerable part—dismissed from further consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the development of the trust, public industry has likewise begun to assume new forms. Thus the government corporations formed during the war. Thus the Port Authority of New York, and in Canada the Hydro-Electric Power Commission, with its partnership arrangements with 600 municipalities for the generation and distribution of electrical energy. The possibilities of this newer type were thus summarized by the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New Republic:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The government may set up a corporation which has as much freedom from legislative interference and red tape as any other corporation. The legislature may define the purpose of the corporation and outline the method of its control; it may make an initial appropriation; beyond that its detailed control may stop. If the corporation has any voting stock, that stock may be vested in an executive official who has an advisory board, or it may be vested in a specially chosen board of directors. This chief authority, whoever he is, proceeds to direct and take full responsibility for the government’s business, just as if he were a corporation director representing private stockholders. The forms which have been developed to handle business undertakings are utilized for government service. A political administration whose prestige largely depends on the success of such an important undertaking is likely to take pains to discover a good manager.”</span></p>

They walked sixteen miles in a drenching rain to explain that they are law-abiding men, that they have worked but two days a week this past winter, that their wages have been cut, and that the company stores charge outrageous prices for the necessities of life. They did just right to complain, and the commissioners promised to try to help them.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By W. H. Harvey (Arkansas)</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">C</span><span class="font5">IVILIZATION cannot function -without . money. The government, business and society cannot function without it. If all the money in the United States were destroyed tonight and we entered life tomorrow<sup>7</sup> without money, a medium of exchange, there would be a total collapse. There would be no way to buy a newspaper or magazine, to ride on a street car or railroad, to buy groceries, to pay men running the trains, or to meet payrolls in the offices and shops of all forms of industry. There would be bread riots in 48 hours in all the cities. Hence, we can understand the absolute necessity for money, a medium of exchange.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Congress has passed laws providing for the government, after making the money, to turn it over to the money lenders, the bankers, who are the individual owners of the banks and interested in making profits from money for themselves. The money is turned over to the bankers at the cost of printing it, estimated at one-half of one percent; they, the bankers, to put the money into circulation by loaning it to the people at an interest rate of 6 percent per annum and up, and as the government needs it, loaning it back to the government at about 4 percent per annum, taking government bonds or certificates as security.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Congress has passed another law in this connection by which the banks are authorized to loan their credit as a substitute for money for as much as ten times the quantity of money they have stored in their bank vaults; the money held by the banks to be regarded as an asset, ■warranting them in loaning their credit, all drawing interest the same as if it were money for as much as ten times the quantity of money they have stored in their vaults.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This law classifies the banks, fixing the quantity of credit they can thus loan, ranging from 7½ to 13 times the quantity of money they have stored, and on time deposits, thirty-three times the amount of money they have hoarded. So the average credit, a substitute for money, they can loan is as much as or more than ten times the amount of actual money they can show they have in their possession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The monthly reports of the secretary of the treasury at Washington show that the money in the national- and state banks is averaging about four billion, six hundred million dollars and that they are loaning an average of about forty-seven billion dollars, which is a little more than ten times the amount of money they have. A little more than ten for one, on which they are drawing INTEREST. This does not include the money in the Federal reserve banks and the enormous interest that they are collecting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Meetings have been held at Washington, called by the president of the United States, attended by industrial captains, and the proposition is for the railways and all other forms of transportation and industry to spend in the near future something like twenty billion dollars. And it goes without saying that they do not have this twenty billion dollars, but that they are to borrow it. In a few instances they may have a balance on hand, but it is only an item of the twenty billion it is proposed to spend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What it means is that the debts in the United States on which the people are paying interest are to be increased by approximately twenty billion dollars.to give prosperity in the United States. The remedy, thus planned, will but add to the economic disease that now<sup>7</sup> afflicts the United States. It is as plain as that two and two make four that the fall will be the harder, the disaster the greater, when it comes, as it will come after the seventeen billion is spent, under the present financial system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If this system is to continue, no real remedy applied, the time will come in the United States when “cities will be sacked, fortresses leveled, churches burned, monasteries of both sexes destroyed, the fields wasted and the country abandoned so that wild beasts will supply the places of men”, as, it came to the people of the Roman Empire under dictatorships and the same financial system that we now have in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Elliott, in his work on Usury, page 182, says: “One cent loaned January 1, A.D. 1, drawing interest at the rate of six percent, compounded annually, on January 1, 1895, would amount to $8,497,840,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, -000,000,000 (8,497,840,000 decillion dollars). To pay this in gold 23.2 grains to the dollar, using it in spheres of pure gold the size of the earth, it would take 610,070,000,000,000,000 spheres of gold to pay the debt.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We will here give the effect of compounding interest, annually, for one hundred years on $1,000. One thousand dollars loaned at six percent interest, compounded annually, in twelve years makes $2,120. We will call it $2,000. In the next twelve years it makes $4,000. Another twelve years and it is $8,000. The fourth period of twelve years it is $16,000. The next period of twelve years it is $32,000. In the next period of twelve years it is $64,000. In the next period of twelve years it is $128,000. In the next or eighth period of twelve years it is $256,000. In eight periods of twelve years each, in all ninety-six years, $1,000 has grown to $256,000, by the compounding of interest. In this calculation we have not taken into account discounts and commissions, and yet, the frightful result is that the money lender and his heirs, who do not use their money to produce anything, have increased their ownership of $1,000 to $256,000, all paid by the borrowers who are the producers of the comforts and necessities of life. And, by thus monopolizing the money, the usurers are diverting the money from the purpose for which money is made, till a toll or tribute is paid them for the use of it by the producers—the toilers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The churches are now bowing the knee to Mammon and by their silence are permitting the reign of Satan here on earth. They cannot worship Christ and by word of approval or silence recognize Usury. By their silence they are </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">particeps criminis,</span><span class="font5"> accomplices, to the greatest crime in all the ages, a crime committed by selfish man-made law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Soliloquy of a Wyoming Banker</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I have $100,000 which I wish to invest to bring me the largest possible profit—in a way that will reduce the risk of loss to a minimum.” Thus soliloquized a man living in 'Wyoming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I can purchase with it $100,000 in government bonds, non-taxable by nation, state, county or otherwise. I will be exempted from taxation. I will thus escape taxes that are becoming burdensome. On any other investment of it my income from it will be taxed, national tax considerably. And then there are state, county, township, municipal, school, and road bonds and, may be, some other form of special taxation that will catch me. I see that in New Mexico these different forms of taxes average 3 percent on a fair cash valuation, which does not include income tax. I do not know what all these taxes amount to here, but they are a plenty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“If I buy government 2 percent bonds I will be exempt from all these forms of taxation, equivalent to from 5 percent to 10 percent when all forms of taxes, including income tax, I escape are considered—and no trouble, no worry. And I will have something that I can sell for cash, at par or for a premium, at any time, which I could not do with any ordinary investment. Of the different forms of government bonds, the 2 percents to me have a distinctive advantage, by which I can make 15 percent or more, annually, off of them and at the same time be exempt from all forms of taxation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“By buying them, the 2 percents, the government will give me back the $100,000 in fresh new money, at a tax, or interest rate, of | of 1 percent per annum and the cost of printing the $100,000, which is only $62.50; and will confer the privilege on me of my loaning the money 6, 8 or 10 times, at 6, 8 or 10 percent per annum, on each loan. Here in Wyoming where I live the rate at which I can loan it will be 8 or 10 percent, with commissions, at times, on the side. The government permits me, with the $100,000 in new money, given me at practically no cost ($62.50 and J of 1 percent only, annually, thereafter) to conduct a loaning system, a National Bank. Under this system, legalized by law, I freeze on to the $100,000 and use it to loan my credit as money, bank credit, that by law answers for money and is called money. By holding on to the $100,000 in money, I can loan bank credit, a checking system, for a million dollars, loaning each dollar of my $100,000 ten times, at each time, say 8 percent, which is 80 percent annually on my $100,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“By the Federal Reserve Act, Sec. 19, Paragraph A, here in Wyoming, a National Bank is required to hold in real money only 7 percent of demand deposits and 3 percent of time deposits, counting on checks going out and coming in to counterbalance each other, except this small margin of 7 and 3 percent that may be needed in actual money. But this small margin is relied on only in an emergency. It is safer and is so practiced by the banks to hold a reserve, in actual money, of 10 or 15 percent, loaning bank credit, the right to check on the bank, 6 or 8 or 10 times the amount of real money the bank has.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Loans Each Dollar Ten Times</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“There is now, all told, in the United States, outside the U. S. Treasury, about 5 billion dollars, and the banks are loaning and drawing interest on forty-five billion dollars. The banks haven’t got in their vaults all this 5 billion dollars, as some of it is floating in the tills and pockets of the people, but they, the banks, have as much as 4 billion, five hundred million dollars of this money, holding it as a legal asset to loan their checking credit for 45 billion dollars. This is loaning $10 for each one dollar they have. The government reports and statistics all confirm these figures.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here the Wyoming man paused and scratched his head. “I wonder,” he said to himself, “how many of the people know this—that each dollar the government has given the bankers on these 2 percent bonds, at practically no cost, $62.50 for printing the money and 1 of 1 percent interest annually—they are loaning it to the people at 6, 8 or 10 percent—ten times. I wonder! I wonder! if the people know this?” Again he paused with his right hand at his mouth, brushing his mustache, “No! they don’t know it, or hell would break loose in this country.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Small Thoughts About Great Problems</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">'(By Innocento Sei’isev, Australia. From </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Heroldo De Esperanto.</span><span class="font3"> Translated from Esperanto by H. W. Kline.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5"> AM not a person who is wholly inclined to refuse acceptance of the European and Western culture, ordinarily named the “Christian” culture. Of course, that culture has many great merits in human progress, and only a person without brains would disagree with that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nevertheless, the other extreme is not fitting, that the Western culture is the only true culture, and that there is no other that is worthy of such a name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There exists only one culture in the world, and one cannot speak about many or a few cultures. Some say that culture is the Western; in fact that is the belief of all Westerners, the same as all of the East think that the only culture is the Eastern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If one speaks about materialistic culture, and that is what I am doing here, one culture does not exist in the world, because culture forms not only the exterior progress of the life of mankind, but also the contents of life, the spiritual essence of progress, the power which moves mankind to progress: the ideals and aims of peoples. And those cultures are not one, but many• and we are acquainted with at least two types: the Western and the Eastern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Western culture is characterized by Christianity (I am alluding to the fountain of&quot; that culture), positiveness, civilization, society. The white Christian race bears that culture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Eastern culture is characterized by Buddhism or Mohammedanism (as fountains of such culture), mysticism, indifference to social and civilized problems, fatalism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The wisdom of the Western world is open for all, and all know it and bow themselves before it. But the wisdom of the Eastern -world lies hidden, and only the ‘elect’ know it; the ‘nonelect’ think that it does not exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nevertheless, during the last ten years there has appeared in the Western world a great interest in the mysterious wisdom of India, hidden in the far-away things of that land, to the many-thousand-year-old China, and to the young, very capable and energetic Japan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And it is fitting that interest appears in those lands. To them, possibly, belongs the future. Because even the Europeans confess and know that Europe is over an abyss, that the Western world stands at the threshold of twilight and catastrophe, that at least its guiding role will be ended shortly; the first new war will bring an end to that Western world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">India, Japan, China—here are the chief outstanding representatives of the Eastern world. And Russia, as a half-Asiatic land, possibly, also will take part in the unified action of the abovementioned three countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The way of India is long until its awakening; but shorter is the way of China to the same thing. It has already awakened; the internal power is boiling; and we believe that these lands will finally unite for great activity. Japan is already ready to play the first violin in the Asiatic concert (pan-Asia).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The future belongs to the yellow race. And I, personally, do not fear it at all. &quot;We have all reason to believe that the yellow race is capable of bearing the ideals of human culture, and even civilization. And I have no reason to push: that race away from a providential path. The Hebrew race has played out its role as a people selected by God; we, Westerners, inherited that title. Now has come the turn of the yellow race to inherit it. The strength of that race is immense. The union of these people does not mean the invasion of other lands. No, these peoples have already begun to accept the civilization of the Westerners, or Occidentals, but they have no desire at all to accept the culture of the Occidentals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Occidentals scarcely succeeded at all in drawing from the Oriental culture; but the Orientals are succeeding in drawing from the Occidental culture that which is good and truly valuable, and they are accepting civilization to a great extent, partially adapting it to their spiritual culture. The example of Japan is before everyone’s eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The yellow peoples will not destroy the civilization of mankind, created by the Western peoples; they will conserve it and use it for the good of mankind: but they will give to the world also its hidden treasures, its things of great value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From all viewpoints, Japan is a wonderful land. Brave, courageous, energetic, wise, capable, virtuous and noble. It is a certainty that it will be able to guide the yellow race to victory, to superiority. It is a youthful, energetic nation; which, indeed, is great superiority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">India, that 400-million mass of mankind, has its culture, which calls forth our interest and admiration. That very old people in its period of history has lived through various phases and experiments; they have great wisdom hidden, which will gradually become apparent throughout the world. A peaceful people, commercial, noble, patient, and unexacting, they are now in a condition of illness the same as Russia; but illness passes away. . . . Certainly the Chinese are not a people inclined to organize; but the Japanese are. Japan must guide. But guidance is not oppression and exploitation. Guidance is only initiative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is to be regretted that Japan has not as yet confessed such a role. It tries often to catch fish in a shallow, muddy place, only by that exciting China, and offending its national feelings. By such further actions, its guidance will possibly be lost and another country, possibly and probably Russia, will accept this guidance. Up to the present time, the politics of Japan in relation to China leads to reciprocated dislike, hate and distrust. Upon that basis, of course, no union can take place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of the same religion, manner of Writing, and skin, Japanese and Chinese surprisingly dislike one the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The time has come to end this hate. Sincerity and reciprocal esteem, and acknowledgment of mutual purposes, should unify these lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And Esperantists of both lands must, as the first, extend hands and work that unification might be hastened. But up to the present time there has never taken place a joint congress of Chinese-Japanese Esperantists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The future of mankind lies at the Pacific, but there the Westerners of the United States and the half-oriental Russians are the only neighbors. I nearly forgot the undefensive Australians. And the others are oriental Japanese, and Chinese; and nearby is India. Here is why the Western world in the person of Europe will stand aside in the affairs of the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pacificism is a characteristic quality of Chinese and Hindus. Indeed, wars will not menace the world if the yellow race reigns. Peaceful life will attend all mankind.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">How to Test an Aluminum Cooking Utensil </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. C. T. Betts (Ohio)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">R</span><span class="font5">EGARDING aluminum cooking utensils: <sup>r</sup>±he proof whether or not the kind you have is fit for cooking purposes can easily be ascertained by using them in making several experiments. This can be done by yourself, to find out whether or not they are fit to use. I would suggest the following experiments for you to make in this connection. Boil some ordinary drinking water in your aluminum kettle for half an hour; place in a clean glass jar. Let set until cool, and note whether or not you can see the white feathery poison in the bottom of your glass jar when the water is cold. This will take only an hour’s time, and you should get a result that will be astonishing. The next experiment I would 'suggest is to color some hen’s eggs with dyes of different colors, making each dyeing process in your aluminum kettle. Note especially whether or not your eggs color according to the color they should be when dyed. If you do not get the eggs in the exact color, according to the instructions on the package, a chemical action has taken place with your dye stuffs which would also take place with various foods cooked in that container.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The next experiment would be to bring some water to the boiling point, and add a little cooking soda to the water, then using a very tarnished spoon or knife, immerse one-half of the spoon or knife in the water. If this portion which has been allowed to remain in the water becomes bright and shiny, while the part outside remains discolored, you have evidence of the activity of the aluminum of this dish upon the food which would be cooked therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Make a jelly from any good fruit acid that will jell. Make the jell in the ordinary manner, and note if the product, when cold, is a nice, livery jell. If you find it soft and stringy instead, you will have evidence of a product thoroughly contaminated, saturated with aluminum hydroxid. A check could be made especially on this with an enamel or porcelain dish. If the results are the same in both your aluminum and the enamel, then the aluminum dish is O.K. to use; if not, the dish should not be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another experiment I believe would interest you, but which will take a little more time, is to make hard soap in an alum'num dish. If the soap becomes hard after being cooked in your aluminum dish, after making it in the ordinary way, your dish is O.K.; otherwise it is not fit to use. The next experiment would take the least time and trouble and would be very definite in its results. Mix the ingredients for the making of a mayonnaise dressing, using apple cider vinegar for the acid ingredient. Boil the ingredients the usual time and note the color of the product, whether it is the proper color, yellow, or has changed to a dark brownish color. If it is a bright yellow, your utensil is all right; if it is a dark color, it is not fit to use. All food specialists who give their radio talks in America are very particular in advising their hearers not to make any salads, especially shrimp or other sea food salads, in aluminum dishes. To test your dish, make one of these salads in it and let it stand till next, morning. If you are alive the next night, your dish is all right. If dead, we advise throwing the dish away.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Fasting—Its Therapeutic and Spiritual Values </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Arthur F. Cox (Michigan)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">F</span><span class="font5">ASTING is generally looked upon as synonymous with starvation, and is therefore shunned as a menace to life. Upon mention of the subject, visions arise of one in an emaciated state and just about ready for the undertaker. It is regarded by many as a means of self-affliction imposed because of some fanatical or religious mania or to gain publicity for some political cause or other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All these views give one a perverted attitude toward a perfectly natural process of bodily purification and spiritual improvement. When properly conducted with patience and self-control a fast of proper duration cannot fail to result in great benefit, but should always be undertaken with the supervision of a competent physician, preferably a naturopath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Volumes have been written on the subject, and it is recommended to read Dr. Linda Hazzard’s book, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Scientific Fasting,</span><span class="font5"> if one cares to go further into the subject, but it may be hoped that enough may be briefly stated to lead one to take a more favorable attitude toward this simple and yet remarkable means of restoring one to a condition of health and efficiency who might otherwise drag through life suffering all sorts of disease symptoms such as oft-recurring or long-standing colds, headaches, catarrh, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a simple fact acknowledged by every progressive student of natural laws governing health and disease that disease is not an entity, a mysterious something which attacks one in the form of germs or inclemency of weather, but rather that the fundamental cause of nearly all disease is due to the retention within the body of morbid matter, setting up a condition known among the drugless profession as toxemia. In other words, the normal balance between the wearing-out and the building-up processes of the body are disturbed through some violation of natural laws governing our physical well-being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some of the contributing causes for this condition might be enumerated as follows: Mankind must of necessity struggle to sustain life under conditions imposed by an environment designed to gradually bring about death. In this environment we find various kinds of food of which the average person knows very little from the standpoint of scientific nutritional value. The result is that the great majority of people daily ingest too much food, wrong combinations of food, and food improperly prepared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then, too, we suffer under the stress and strain of modern life, the unwholesome effects in the form of chemical poisons due to a disturbed mental attitude, some causes of which are fear, worry, anger, disappointment, melancholy, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Also, there is the normal burden of waste matter to be carried off through the regular eliminative channels, the bowels, kidneys and pores, which become tired and partially paralyzed because of the tremendous burden forced upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If one will take even as much interest in his own precious organism as he takes in his automobile, he will upon the first symptoms of disease consult a competent physician and under his supervision go on a total or partial fast for from three to forty days or even longer when the severity of the case indicates; he will be taking nature’s most simple and yet most effective method of reestablishing normal health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Upon beginning a fast the system starts to clean house, and one will notice loss of weight, nervousness and mental depression, and as the poisons enter’ the various channels of elimination the mucous membranes of the nasal passages become irritated and congested and then are produced the symptoms of inflammation, catarrhal elimination, and perhaps various forms of skin eruptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These increased processes of elimination which are wrongly interpreted by those uninformed of nature’s true healing crisis frequently frighten the patient, causing him to return to unnatural orthodox medical treatment. Gradually, as these symptoms disappear, which they invariably do with the thorough purification of the system, a new sense of well-being is enjoyed, the mental faculties become more keen, memory is better, and spiritual things are more readily grasped and appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the fast is completed and the system has had its finest rest and purification, nature indicates, by the return of hunger; and then, and not until then, could starvation even begin. As food is taken following a fast one enjoys a sensation of hunger, the gratification of which is exquisite beyond description. The senses of smell and taste are keen and the food selective sensations are very active. The tongue is now pink and clean; the breath is sweet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many notable examples of prolonged fasts might be cited, but one will suffice, of special interest, that of Jesus Christ. We know that the perfect man Jesus was always obedient to divinely established laws, the laws of the body, to its necessities, and subject to its temptations. He had, during His life among depraved men, an environment wholly unsuited to a perfect man, but one designed to bring about the ultimate death of all mankind. Surely the food He ate during His lifetime was far from perfect, to say the least.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fasting for the sake of health was understood and followed by ancient civilizations. That Jesus was aware of the practice is fully substantiated by the evident purpose and scientific completion of a forty-day fast. Will anyone contend that Jesus was negligent of the needs of the body, so much as to fail to nourish His body during all that period simply because He was so engrossed in prayer and study? Surely not. Rather, the only rational conclusion would be that, now as He was about to begin His active ministry, when all His powers of endurance would be called upon and mental clarity and acumen would be commanded as never before, therefore to avail oneself of this simple and thorough course of internal cleanliness was highly desirable. “Be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord.”—Isa. 52:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let no one erroneously conclude that the mind of Jesus was in any sense weakened by the fast, so that He was made more vulnerable to Satan’s attacks. A sense of justice would not permit a conclusion of that kind. His Father w’ould hardly have permitted it in view of the tremendous consequences of the trial Jesus endured. On the other hand, as attested by thousands of well conducted fasts, the mind of Jesus was keenly attuned to the will of His Father and His memory of Scriptural injunctions was marvelously capable of serving Him under the temptations of Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Attempts at Calendar Improvement</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5">T ISN’T so easy to make up a calendar to suit the business and religious ideas of two billion people, living under some seventy different governments. It would be easier if the earth revolved around the sun in a given number of days or weeks, with no fractions of time left over; but that is not the way it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Actually, the earth swings around the sun in 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds; and that has given astronomers and politicians and priests and businessmen something to think about from the time it was first discovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord God Jehovah himself arranged the first calendar for the Israelites, and without a doubt it will be His calendar that will be used in the world soon, but we note with interest some of the attempts of men to fix things up to suit their ideas of what would be right and preferable from their points of view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The League of Nations will have a calendar discussion this fall. Two of the calendars that will be brought before it for consideration are the International Fixed Calendar and the World Calendar. Each is based on a year that nominally has only 364 days in it, but between December and January there is a holiday which is for convenience called Leap Day. This day, which always follows a Saturday, is also called Saturday. If adopted it would cause the Jews and Seventh-day Adventists and Seventh-day Baptists to tear out their hair by the handfuls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the year that we call Leap Year comes around, each of these calendars has another Leap Day between June and July and this also is figured as a double Saturday, thus further mixing up the Jews and Seventh-day Adventists and Seventh-day Baptists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The difference between the two calendars is that the International Fixed Calendar has thirteen months of 28 days each. Sunday is always the first day in each month. Saturday is always the last day. Once the calendar is in operation the calendar for any month is the same as for that of every other month. The new month is called Sol, and comes in between June and July.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The World Calendar proposes twelve months in the year, but rearranges the number of days in each month so that there are 91 in each quarter, 31 days in January, April, July and October, and 30 days in each of the other months. Its proponents think a thirteen-month calendar would make extra work and expense for bank statements, monthly reports, publishers, public service and insurance corporations.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A local ten-page sheet gave space to what the author named Jones thought was a mighty roar; but it was only a squeak to our ears. It amused us &quot;muchly”, and we thought you might enjoy smiling over it, so are sending you the detached leaf upon which the article occurs. We could not understand why, all at once in the afternoon-we began to place more books, until an old lady showed it to one of the canvassers. Then we knew that the Devil’s boomerang had begun to take effect. This old lady said, “I see where it says something about the trading of chickens for the books. I have some that I want to trade for some books,” which she did. And others who showed the paper to other canvassers were not influenced against them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But the blind creedal prejudice here is something terrible. Talk about the pioneers’ being at the forefront of the battle and on the firing line! One who has never been there, where ignorance and superstition, aided by the “blind guides”, is so dense as to be felt, and opposition to the Kingdom message can be seen in the eyes and actions of the poor dupes, can realize how weary and. war-worn one feels after a day of wrestling with the Satanic conditions. If it were not that our Guide and Protector has put His words in our mouth and covered us with His hand and given us the &quot;joy of the Lord” to be our strength, it would be useless for us to try to cope with the forces of darkness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Illiteracy here amongst the people canvassed thus far (we have been here only two weeks) is almost 50 percent.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By W. L. Bowen</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ordained ministers; for the entire Bible and the comfort that it gives to those who believe and strive to practice its teachings, and for the privilege of living in a country which recognizes the church as a force for good. I’m sorry that I have been slow in expressing my gratitude for these blessings. I am sorry that there are those who do not stop to think how much they owe to these blessings. I am sorry that there are some who are so thoughtless as to ignore them, and that there are some who scoff at and scorn them, but claim the safety and privilege which are found only in Christendom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is time for everyone to show his gratitude for the Christian preachers by supporting, helping and defending them in their Christian work. We do not hesitate to call upon them for various needs at a moment’s notice; are we going to allow them to be falsely accused by a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">boasted unorganized religion, </span><span class="font4">which is loading them with the blame for the conditions of the country? Will we allow them to be called a selfish, hypocritical group of people preaching for money ? How many preachers do we know who receive a living equal to the living of the people they preach to ? In Luke 10:3, 4, Christ when sending out the seventy disciples said, “Behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves. Carry neither purse nor scrip”; and continuing his instruction to them, 7th verse, he said, ‘ ‘ The laborer is worthy of his hire. ’ ’ In Romans 10:13-15 we find why people are called to preach, and the 15th verse ends with these words: “How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!” We do allow the preachers to be attacked if we buy, read, believe and keep in the way of children the highly colored, boldly embossed books which a band of colporteurs have lately forced upon the people in the surrounding country, or if we calmly listen in to the program put on by the writer of these books—a lawyer who fits in very nicely with the company of lawyers that tried to tangle or confuse Jesus when He was on earth among men as a man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A small advertising copy of the class of books written by Judge Rutherford came into my possession uninvited some time ago. I thought I burned it, but I came across it the day the colporteurs wasted a lot of my time and patience. This book is a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">very</span><span class="font4"> unreasonable book, in which a supposed conversation between a. lawyer and preacher takes place. The preacher is represented as a narrow-minded, selfish man while the lawyer is liberal. The argument results in the preacher having to give up, and leave. In addition it advertises the larger books. Two pages in the center of the book advertise the entire set. From these two pages the following paragraph is taken which is the key to the entire set:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Blind Guides, Serpents, Fools, Vipers, Hypocrites, Whited Sepulchers, full of dead men’s bones. That’s what Jesus called the preachers and priests of his day. A sanctimonious class they were, who made long prayers in public, but who allied themselves with the politicians and rulers of the nation to rob the poor, oppress the people and enrich themselves. Jesus said their father was the Devil. And so it is today! The clergy who pose as representatives of God, are themselves responsible for the terrible condition of so-called Christian Civilization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The above paragraph from Judge Rutherford’s book is enough to cause every sincere Christian to rebel against such false impressions as the books are expected to cause. Can we really think of one preacher that has enriched himself in a financial way by preaching? Instead, think of preachers who have to teach school or farm or do some other work to live!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It would be a great deal more to Christ’s glory to pay—notice I say pay, not give—to the preacher the price of one, three or seven books than to buy one book or more to either offend or poison the minds of all that read them. If you who have bought books of this sort read the books and only the scripture referred to by them you will fail to read important portions of the scripture. If you arc deluded into thinking that the writer of these books has knowledge of the Bible which no other person has, you arc setting him up far above any human possibility. We can understand enough of the Bible to have a happy Christian life here and prepare our souls for a better home in Heaven. We need not try to see into the future for the angels in Heaven do not know God’s plans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The one fact that these colporteurs and the books they sell aim their .attacks on organized Christianity and Christian clergymen, should make every Christian rise in their defense, for organized Christianity is the only hope for any nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You who have bought these books would do well to bum them. If there is a community where they have not yet been, may you refuse as a community to buy one book. Think too much of your chickens to “swap” one for a book of this sort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A READER.,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Organized Church or Organized Truth, Which?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">U</span><span class="font5">NTIL the matter is cleared up in one’s mind there is room for some confusion on the subject of whether one’s loyalty should be to the organized church or the organized truth. A little reflection will show that it must necessarily be the latter if we are to be right with God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Would anybody say that Jesus’ first duty was to do as He was bidden by the priests of organized Jewish religion? At twelve years of age Jesus said not, “Wist ye not that I must be about the business of our church?” But He did say, “Wist ye not that I must be about my Father’s business?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is true that while He was yet a child He did inquire what the doctors of the law knew, but He seems to have been satisfied with that first interview. They were given over to teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. They had forsaken the word of the Lord and ■what wisdom was in them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We notice that Jesus’ constant appeal was to the Scriptures, the Word of God, and not to the sectarian prejudices of the people. Nowhere was it His theme that the people should get behind the Pharisees or the Sadducees or the Essenes or the Herodians. He said of some of these that they had taken away the key of knowledge, and that they would neither go into the kingdom of heaven themselves nor permit others to enter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nor was Jesus concerned about supporting the above-named sects in their religious work. Hear what He had to say, and let it speak for itself:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The scribes and the Pharisees [the clergy of His day] sit in Moses ’ seat: all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not. For they bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers. But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, and love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief scats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi. But be not ye called Rabbi [or Reverend] : for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren. And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven. Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ. But he that is greatest among you, shall be your servant. And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself, shall be exalted. But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore you shall receive the greater damnation. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.—Matt. 23: 2-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason Jesus made this attack upon the clergy and the organized religion of His day ■was that they had strayed away from God’s Word and were teaching the people impossible, unreasonable and inconsistent things which they had received by tradition from their fathers. Notice, now, how this whole matter is set before us in the gospels:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thon came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">elders?</span><span class="font4"> for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God</span><span class="font4"> by your tradition? For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death. But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; and honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God</span><span class="font4"> of none effect by your tradition. Ye hypocrites! well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">in vain</span><span class="font4"> they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. ■—Matt. 15 :1-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That is really the crux of the matter. Judge Rutherford’s statements today concerning our present-day clergy and present-day organized religion are not that they are clergy nor that they are organized, but that they have been overreached by the Devil and are faithful to him and his ways of doing things, and not faithful to the Scriptures, which alone constitute our beacon light in this evil time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason why the people read his books, and why his books have attained a circulation of 93,500,000 copies, is that their constant appeal is to the Scriptures, and the Scriptures only. And in view of the condition of the world, is it not time that attention is paid to what God has to say as to His way out of our present impasse ?</span></p>

I am seventy-two years old; have been a member of the Baptist church since I was fifteen. The more I read the Bible the more I find myself always asking, Why cannot I get more out of the.Bible? I enclose one dollar; how I wish I could have all of Judge Rutherford’s books and enjoy them. I have to sit at home day after day and suffer all the time with rheumatism. I will try to earn the money to buy the other books. In the meantime I will read, think and study these. Ask God to help me; I am so tired.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">newspaper writers and others to take the census of certain districts, buildings and organizations, and, so far as one can judge, it was a fair and impartial effort to get at the truth of the public attitude on present-date medicine and drugless healing. “Six thousand, seven hundred and seventy-two persons were interviewed and their answers written down.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The result was the greatest jar to the Medical Egotism that has ever been recorded. Thirteen percent had never been to a drugless physician or healer, and seven percent were opposed to medical doctors for what they considered good reasons. Seventy-five percent had formed the habit of going to drugless physicians of various healing cults. Seven percent were solidly for medical doctors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The above story appeared in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Literary Digest</span><span class="font5"> and has been reprinted by hundreds of periodicals everywhere. Since the above census was taken medical boards have made every conceivable effort to depopularize the other branches of the healing sciences, going so far as to form lobbying organizations to deal with the legislatures and in the guise of “protecting the dear public” have intimidated legislators into believing that the medics “have been ordained by God and that they alone can safeguard the dear public’s health”.</span></p>

Any chiropractor, no matter how poor he is, knows better than this.

<p><span class="font6">The New Song of the Christian</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HROUGHOUT the Scriptures songs are used to express gratitude, praise and inward joy. It is only those who are happy and joyous at heart who indulge in singing. The sour and morose, the doubtful and fearful, the dis</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">couraged and perplexed, never sing. Their inward heart feelings are generally expressed by mutterings, imprecations and curses. The only people on earth who can be truly happy are the Lord's people, who fully realize what Jehovah’s purpose and work is, and are cooperating with Him in the accomplishment of the same. Their gratitude to Jehovah finds its expression in songs of praise to His name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Psalm 40, verse 3, are these words: “He hath put a new song- in my mouth, even </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">praise </span><span class="font5">unto our God.” This </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">new song</span><span class="font5"> is mentioned in many Bible texts, but What is meant by the new song? When is it to be sung? and Who are to do the singing? are questions that few can answer. In fact very few people have ever given these questions any thought. But when the Lord’s people learn that He purposes to give those who are fully devoted to Him a new song, a song of joy and gladness, and that He has a specified time when this song can be learned and sung, the subject at once becomes an interesting one to them, and they are anxious to learn the song and anxious to sing it at the right time and in the right way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The children of Israel were God’s chosen people. They had entered into a covenant with Him. No other nation, had entered into such a covenant with God, and hence all others were regarded as Jehovah’s enemies and Israel’s enemies. Without doubt, the reason that the other nations hated Israel was that they claimed to be God’s special people, and because God had so manifestly blessed them on many occasions. These outside nations were under the dominion of Satan, who used them to wage war against and persecute God’s chosen people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whenever the heathen nations warred against Israel, and Israel cried to Jehovah for help, He invariably delivered them from their enemies in miraculous and marvelous ways. On the occasion of these deliverances, a gala day was proclaimed and Israel’s poets composed songs of praise to Jehovah God. These songs were expressive of great joy, as well as of gratitude and thanksgiving, and invariably magnified and lauded the name of Jehovah as the only one worthy to be praised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The real instigator of all these persecutions was Satan, who is God’s enemy, and the enemy of the people of God. Any opposition to the Lord’s people is opposition to Jehovah, and any persecution of them is persecution of Jehovah. It is therefore a serious matter for anyone to oppose or in any way hinder the work of those w-ho are trying to magnify the name of God and are declaring His purposes in the earth. On the other hand, God’s people are in duty bound to expose the creeds of men, and those man-made teachings which are contrary to the Bible. The reason that they must oppose and expose these false doctrines is that they are set forth by God’s great enemy Satan, and for the express purpose of misrepresenting God and deceiving His people. A Christian who fails to do this is a traitor toward God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Apostle Paul tells us that God’s dealings with Israel -were types of His dealings -with the true church since Pentecost. In 1 Corinthians 10:11 we read: ‘Now all these things happened unto them for types, and were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages have come.’ We are living in the ends of the ages right now, the last end of the age during which the church has been selected and the first end of the age during which the world will be blessed. In the ends of the ages God purposes a most marvelous deliverance of His people from the hand of their enemies, and this deliverance was pictured or illustrated by the deliverances of the Israelites from their enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But have the Lord’s people any enemies at this time ? The answer is Yes. The Devil is their enemy and instigates some men to become their enemy and to engage in persecuting them. The Lord’s people are declaring that Christ’s kingdom is now being established on the earth, and that soon all people will be aware of it and will enjoy its blessings, if they will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan does not want that kingdom established, neither do his agents among men. Hence Satan opposes the Kingdom message because of the fact that the Kingdom will bind him for a thousand years. Politicians oppose the message because a righteous government will stop their work. Profiteers oppose it because the Kingdom will put an end to their profiteering; clergymen oppose it because the Kingdom will expose their false doctrines, and will show them up as having accepted money for teaching that which misrepresented God. Unitedly these constitute Satan’s organization on earth’, and just as unitedly they oppose the Lord’s people who are announcing the Kingdom. This opposition is foretold in Psalm 2:2,3 as follows: “The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.” These bands and cords include the truths which the Lord’s people are setting forth at the present time, the truth about the coming Kingdom.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">ssa</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">The Lord purposes to deliver His people from Satan and his organization in the near future, in what men call “the battle of Armageddon”. It will be a glorious time when political bribery and corruption are at an end; when selfish exploitation of the people by the profiteers will cease; when all false doctrines are exposed and the people hear the truth, and nothing but the truth, about God and His purposes, and when no one has the power to further hinder or injure the truth or the Lord’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the people learn of this deliverance, they will sing a song of joy and praise to the great Jehovah for the same. That will be a gala day indeed. The majority of the people will learn of their deliverance </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">after</span><span class="font5"> it has been accomplished, and will sing their songs then. But the saints, the true church class, have been privileged to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">foresee</span><span class="font5"> the coming deliverance and to sing the song of praise now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They are telling the people of the approaching triumph of Jehovah, the vindication of His name, the coming deliverance of the oppressed, and that all this is near at hand. They are telling the people of the coming destruction of Satan’s wicked and oppressive organization, in the very near future. They are happy and glad in delivering this message, for they realize that it is the most beautiful and loving message that earth has ever heard. They are announcing the fact that Satan will soon be bound for a thousand years; that sin and death, sorrow and pain, poverty and crime will soon end for ever. In doing this they are magnifying the name of Jehovah, and calling attention to the fact that deliverance is coming by and through the power of Jehovah. They are not magnifying the name of men, and they are warning the people that deliverance will not come by or through any man-made scheme. These will all be failures. They are singing forth the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">honor of Jehovah’s </span><span class="font5">name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This wonderful deliverance from Satan and his power, and from the power of his organization on earth, is pictured many times in the Old Testament, when God delivered the nation of Israel from its enemies. He delivered them at times by fighting their battles for them, and at other times by miraculously </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">hindering</span><span class="font5"> the enemy from destroying them. The fact that God destroyed entire armies at times in accomplishing the deliverance of His people does not mean that God approves of war, or that He is vengeful or destructive by nature, but He did this to teach the lesson that He will ultimately destroy all His enemies in second death. These deliverances of His chosen people were simply illustrations of the fact that all who oppose Him or His people will eventually be destroyed. People who have no knowledge of God’s purpose seize upon these texts as proof that God approves Avar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Israel was God’s chosen people, and therefore Israel’s enemies were God’s enemies. In destroying these enemies, God was not only teaching the lesson that He Avould eventually destroy all who persisted in their opposition to Him, but also teaching the lesson that He has the power to do it, and that He will not per</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">mi</span><span class="font5">t opposition to Him and His gracious purpose to continue forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the most marvelous of these deliverances was the deliverance of the children of Israel from Egypt, and the drowning of the Egyptian army in the Red sea. This event pictures the deliverance of the entire human family from the power of Satan, and the overthrow of Satan and his allies, both angels and men, in the “battle of that great day of God Almighty”, which is to occur in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For centuries the nation of Israel had been in bondage in Egypt, under the dominion of the wicked, haughty and selfish Pharaoh, who had placed cruel taskmasters over them for the purpose of oppressing them and enriching himself. Satan instigated this wicked oppression because the Israelites were God’s chosen people. Satan used Pharaoh as his agent, because he was AAdcked, selfish and cruel. Honest people, who love righteousness and love their fellow men, cannot be used by Satan to injure, persecute and oppress them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The time came for the Lord to deliver His people from this bondage and the power of Pharaoh. He chose Moses to be the visible leader in this work, but the deliverance was by the hand of Jehovah God himself. Moses’ part was to tell Pharaoh what God purposed to do, and, as God’s representative, to encourage and instruct the people. The record of this deliverance, and of the destruction of Pharaoh and his army, is found in Exodus, chapters 3 to 14 inclusive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In First Corinthians 10:1-11 We are told that the deliverance of Israel and the destruction of Pharaoh’s army 'was a type, and was written for the church’. In this type, Pharaoh represents Satan; his government pictures the wicked, corrupt empire of Satan, now on the earth, which is oppressing, injuring and persecuting all who love righteousness, truth, honesty, justice and their fellow men. God’s purpose is to deliver all these from the power of Satan, in the coming battle of God Almighty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Immediately following this battle, Satan is to be bound so that he will deceive the nations no more for a thousand years. Just as Moses announced to Pharaoh, that God had determined to deliver His people, so now God has His representatives in the earth, who are announcing the complete destruction of the Devil’s organization, and warning Satan and his allies, namely, all those who are oppressing their fellow' men and teaching false doctrines about God, of their impending overthrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pharaoh resisted the demands of Moses; and just so Satan’s agents, composed of those men and organizations of men and women who are oppressing, exploiting and deceiving the peoples of the earth, will resist the message now going forth, and will be completely overthrown, as was Pharaoh and his army.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After the deliverance of Israel, Moses composed a song of praise unto Jehovah God and all the people sang it to His glory. It was a song of joy and gratitude. It exalted God, and not Moses. It gave to God the credit for their deliverance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This song is recorded in Exodus 15, and, in part, reads as follows: “Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously. . . . The Lord is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation; he is my God, . . . and I will exalt him. Thy right hand, 0 Lord, . . . hath dashed in pieces the enemy. . . . Who is like unto thee, 0 Lord, among the gods ? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? . . . Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed; thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After Satan’s government is destroyed, and Satan bound, this new song will be sung to the praise of Jehovah God by all the people. It will give the credit for their deliverance to Jehovah, and not to man. No man-made schemes, political, financial or religious, will ever deliver the people; hence no songs of praise will be sung to their honor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Picture, if you can, the Devil bound for a thousand years; the grafting and corrupt politicians and the wicked and oppressive profiteers for ever gone; all false teachings, like trinity, eternal torment and human immortality, completely restrained, so that God, His purpose and His -work can be no longer misrepresented; think of wars, graft, bribery, fraud, lobbying and lying banished for ever; think of poverty, distress, sorrow, disease and death gone for ever; then think of life, liberty, peace, health and happiness as being the. portion of every human creature. When this condition is fully ushered in, the people will sing for joy and give praise to Jehovah God, to whom it properly belongs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Isaiah 24 we read of the destruction of Satan’s organization and the joy of the people thereat, as follows: “Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof. And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury.” This text tells us that the destruction will come alike upon the priests (religious leaders),upon the great employers of labor, and upon the financiers and the usurers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The 16th verse says: “From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even glory to the righteous [One].” Verse 21 says: “And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall punish the host of the high ones, . . . and the kings of the earth upon the earth.” Again, in Psalm 67:3, 4 we read: “Let the people praise thee, 0 God; let all the people praise thee. 0 let the nations be glad, and sing for joy; for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth.” Still again, in Isaiah 35:10 we read: “The ransomed of the <sup>T</sup> .ord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Moses pictured a class, called the Lord’s “watchmen”, who are but a little flock in the earth, but whom the Lord is using to warn and instruct the people and to defy the anathemas and threats of Satan and his agents. They are the Lord’s saints. This class is singing the new song now, even before the deliverance is accomplished. They are giving praise to Jehovah God and magnifying His name. They sing for joy and gratitude, and their delight is to announce the kingdom of Christ at hand, and the comingdeliverance of the people. They do this by going from door to door and offering to the people the message in printed form, which enlightens their minds as to what God is doing and what He has purposed to do in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They are not lauding men or man-made schemes: the League of Nations, federation of churches, the prohibition law, the efforts of missionaries or reformers. They are not singingpraises to these institutions or men, because they know full well that the efforts of these will fail because they do not have the approval of Jehovah God. One so-called “great” worldly-wise preacher recently said over the air that he does not want Christ to come until the earth has been ‘robed in God’s glory by man’s moral achievements’. How foolish a statement! Man has never accomplished any moral achievements, and can never robe the earth in righteousness. It will take the kingdom of God to do this; and when that kingdom is established, one of its first works will be to stop such boasting and restrain such boasters. That kingdom will robe the earth in righteousness; therefore His watchmen are singing the praises of His kingdom, and not the praises of any man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another class of people of good will who love righteousness and their fellow men and who will be glad to see the kingdom set up and everybody blessed and happy will also be delivered in the coming destruction. There are millions of them, and many of them never profess to be Christians. They are not hypocrites or deceivers; they do not love either oppression or tyranny. They are glad to hear of the coming destruction of Satan’s organization, and the blessing of the peoples of earth. God will spare this class in the coming destruction, and these will constitute the ‘millions now living who will never die’. Their song of joy and gratitude will be sung when their deliverance is complete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">watchmen,</span><span class="font5"> knowing of the coming deliverance, are singing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">now,</span><span class="font5"> and their songs honor Jehovah, His word, His law, His power, His mercy, and His righteousness. They never sing the praises of men. We read of their song in Psalm 40:1-3 as follows: “I waited patiently for the Lord; and he inclined unto me and heard my cry. . . . And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">praise unto our God.”</span><span class="font5"> Isaiah 52: 8 (margin) says of them: “Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing; they shall see eye to eye when the Lord returns again to Zion.” Again, in Psalm 32:6, 7 we read that ‘every one that is godly [shall] pray unto the Lord; surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him. Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about -with songs of deliverance’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Again, in Psalm 119: 54 we also read of these, saying, “Thy </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">statutes</span><span class="font5"> have been my songs.” In Psalm 21:13 we read of these watchmen, as follows: ‘We will sing and praise </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">thy power.’</span><span class="font5"> In Psalm 51:14 we read: “My tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.” Psalm 101:1 says: “I will sing of mercy and of judgment : unto thee, 0 Lord, will I sing”; and again, in Psalm 69:30: “I will praise the name of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">God</span><span class="font5"> -with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.” One more quotation, Psalm 96:1-8: “0 sing unto the Lord a new song; sing unto the Lord, all the earth. Sing unto the Lord, bless </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font5"> name: shew forth </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font5"> salvation from day to day. Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people. For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods. For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the Lord made the heavens. Honour and majesty are before </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">him:</span><span class="font5"> strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. Give unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the Lord glory and strength. Give unto the Lord the glory </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">due</span><span class="font5"> unto his name.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The only people who can sing this song now is the little flock of God’s anointed, His </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">watchmen.</span><span class="font5"> To be a watchman one must be a student of the Bible and know and believe what it</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>JUNE 24</sup>’<sup>1931</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The qOLDEN AQE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>639</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">teaches. He must be acquainted with its prophetic utterances, and be on the lookout for the fulfilments of the same. It is self-evident that those who do not study Bible prophecies will be unaware of their fulfilments. The work of the watchmen is to tell the people of these fulfilments ; to announce the coming deliverance, and to warn Satan and his army of their impending doom. If they faithfully do this work, they will be singing the new song, for the reason that the new song consists in lauding, praising, magnifying, and exalting the name of Jehovah God, and telling the people of the gracious blessings in store for them as soon as their deliverance is accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is called a new song for the reason that it is a different message from what has ever been given to the people before, about God. It is a happifying message, full. of hope and good cheer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The question that everyone who loves the Lord should ask himself at this time is, Am I singing forth the praises of Jehovah God, or the praises of some of earth’s worldly-wise ones, who think they can establish righteousness in the earth by their own efforts and that they do not need the help of the Lord in doing it? Am I one of His watchmen, and am I aware of the fact that we are living in that day when the new song is to be sung? (Isa. 26:1) or am I among those who are belittling the message, and scoffing at the fact that the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">King</span><span class="font5">dom is soon to be set up in the earth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Am I serving the Lord by declaring that all blessings will come through His kingdom, or am I serving the adversary, by supporting and advocating man-made schemes. If we are doing the latter, then we have definitely taken our stand with Satan and his organization, have become a part of that organization, and an enemy of God and our felloAvmen, and will be destroyed as opposers of God and His work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let us all join in singing this new song, even </span><span class="font1">PRAISES TO OUR GOD.</span></p>
