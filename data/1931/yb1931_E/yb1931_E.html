<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font5">HE Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is engaged in the most important work that is being done on the earth. Those who are associated in this work do not work for any personal or pecuniary gain. With them it is the greatest privilege to engage in this work; hence hours are not counted by them. They do not limit themselves to an eight-hour day. Every other organization under the sun is moved by some selfish reason, either personal or pecuniary, for the work in which they engage, but the Society is carried on for an unselfish reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the worldly institutions or organizations are in doubt and perplexity as to what the future holds for them. The Society is not in the slightest doubt as to the results and future. These statements will sound peculiar to some, and therefore an explanation is deemed proper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">More than six thousand years ago one of Jehovah’s sons, then called Lucifer, was entrusted with the high office of overseer of earth’s creation including perfect man. Lucifer rebelled against God and turned all of his power to wickedness. He defied Jehovah to put a man on earth who would hold steadfastly to his integrity when put to the most severe test. He caused man to fall and receive the sentence of death. He continued to reproach God. His name Lucifer was then changed by the Lord, and since then he has been designated in the Bible as Satan, Dragon, Serpent and Devil. God announced his purpose to destroy the wicked one. He could have done so immediately and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">have started another creation of perfect man on earth. Perfect wisdom took the very opposite course. Before accomplishing the destruction of Satan and his wicked allies, God purposes to let Satan have a full opportunity to prove his challenge, and for that reason Jehovah has not interfered with the Devil in carrying out his wicked schemes, until his own due time arrives, Jehovah did state that he would in his own due time interfere and destroy the wicked one and his works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From Eden, and afterwards for a period of more than sixty centuries, Satan has pursued his wicked course unhindered, except occasionally God has caused his own name to be brought prominently before men that they might not entirely forget the Creator. Now the Scriptures and the physical facts show that God’s due time is at hand, when he will destroy Satan and his works. Before doing so, however, the Lord will have a special work done in the earth; and that work is now in progress, and the Society herein mentioned is the visible part of God’s organization on earth that is doing that work. This work must be done and must be completed according to the Lord’s commandments. What then is that work, and why is it being done?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the time of man’s expulsion from Eden, Jehovah announced that he would bring forward a “seed” through which a righteous government would be established on earth, and by which Satan’s wicked organization would be destroyed. Later he made known that this promised “seed” is Christ Jesus his beloved Son, and those associated with him in his work of righteousness. During the past nineteen centuries he has been selecting this “seed”, which work is now about completed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To redeem man from death it was necessary for Jesus to become a man and die, which he did; and therefore Jehovah raised him out of death and gave him life everlasting as a divine ereature. The chief purpose of the coming of Jesus to earth was not for the redemption of man, but to deliver a message of truth for Jehovah and incidentally to provide redemption for the human race in furtherance of God’s purpose. He was faithful in the performance of the work assigned to him, and because of his faithfulness Jehovah gave to him, amongst other things, the name of “The Faithful and True Witness”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nearly nineteen centuries have passed since Jesus ascended to heaven; and never again will human eyes behold him, because he is divine. He is clothed with all power in heaven and in earth as Jehovah’s chief officer. The divine promise is that in God’s due time Jesus would return and take over the affairs of the world and rule them in righteousness. In 1914 Jesus Christ was placed upon his throne of authority by Jehovah and began to exercise his kingly power, and this is shown by the physical facts and the Scriptures, to wit: Psalm 110:1-4 and Psalm 2: 6. Immediately thereafter a war in heaven took place, with Jesus and his angels on one side, and Satan and his angels on the other side, and Satan was cast out of heaven and down to the proximity of the earth, and his wicked actions are now carried on at the earth. That is the reason there is now such a great increase of crime and wickedness in the earth. It is a condition of darkness and wickedness that immediately precedes the complete overthrow of Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is hardly necessary to say that the Almighty God has an organization to carry on his work. He is the God of order and everything with him is orderly, and he works through his organization. Christ Jesus is made the chief one in that organization. It was about A.D. 1879 that Christ Jesus began to restore to his faithful followers on earth the truths of the Scriptures that had long been hidden by the wrongful acts of Satan’s representatives on earth. The Scriptures designate this work as ‘preparing the way before the Lord’. About that same time publication of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> began, and the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society was shortly thereafter organized, and since then has been the visible means or channel to communicate between the followers of Christ Jesus concerning his work, and who are yet on the earth. Without a doubt the Lord directed the formation of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From its beginning until 1917 the Society continued to make known the truth to the people concerning God’s purposes. In the year 1917 the World War was on, and a time of great persecution and trial came upon the people of God on earth. The World War furnished the occasion for such persecution and ill treatment. This became so severe that the work of the Society was practically stopped for more than a year. Then the Lord revealed to his people the reason why this work was stopped for a time, and why it was again revived. Since the year 1919 the work of the Society has been going forward with an ever increasing momentum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the 24th chapter of Matthew will be found the great prophecy of Christ Jesus concerning the events that would come to pass at the end of the world. That prophecy was spoken in answer to the question propounded to him by his disciples. He had taught them of his return and of his kingdom, when he would establish righteousness, oust the wicked one, and bless the peoples of the earth. Keenly interested in this, his disciples asked him what would be the sign or proof of his presence and the end of the world. He answered that the beginning of that period of time would be marked by a world war, followed quickly by famine, pestilence and other disasters amongst the people. That prophecy began to have its fulfilment in the autumn season of 1914, and that marks the time of the fulfilment of the prophecy in Psalm 2:6, which reads: “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.” It also marks the fulfilment of Revelation the 11th chapter, verses 17 and 18, which read as follows: “Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a correspondency between the second and first comings of the Lord Jesus Christ, and particularly in this respect: Three and one-half years after he began his ministry, to wit, in the year 33 (A.D.), he came into Jerusalem to the temple and offered himself as king to Israel, and began a work of cleansing the temple. Corresponding thereto his second appearing took place in the autumn season of 1914, when he was placed upon his throne, and three and one-half years thereafter, to wit, in the spring of 1918, the Lord Jesus appeared at his spiritual temple and began the examination and cleansing thereof. By that temple is meant all of those who are wholly devoted to God and approved by him as the followers of Christ Jesus, and which constitute the temple of God not made with the hands of creatures. (2 Cor. 6:16; 1 Cor. 3:16) The coming of the Lord Jesus to the spiritual temple was for examination of his followers and for judgment. The approved ones from that time forward the Lord Jesus has been gathering into his organization, and making them members of the temple class. Those who are members of the temple class and who yet remain on earth are called the “remnant” of the Lord, and are anointed, which means officially appointed to do the work of the Lord on the earth as he commands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The corporation bearing the name “Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society” was created and organized under the laws of the land to carry on the work therein designated. This, however, is merely a matter of legal organization. The real Society herein mentioned and called the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is made up of a company of men and women who are wholly, unselfishly, and completely devoted to God and his cause of righteousness, and who refuse to have any sympathy or cooperation with any part of Satan’s organization. Such have been taken into the covenant with Christ Jesus for his kingdom, and have therefore devoted themselves to the service of the Lord. Therefore, when mention is made herein of the “Society”, the purpose is to include only those who are entirely devoted to God and to his cause of righteousness. The Lord has supplied the testimony to each one, that he may determine whether or not he is a member of God’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What is the reason for these men and women to be on the earth at this time, and be counted as a part of God’s organization; are they preparing themselves to go to heaven ? Jesus gave the. answer to that question. Speaking of the faithful ones whom he would find on coming to his temple, he collectively calls them by the name and title of “servant”, or “faithful and wise servant”. His words are: “But know this, that if the good man of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to “be broken up. Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh. Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season! Blessed is that servant, whom his lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing. Verily I say unto you, that he shall make him ruler over all his goods.”— Matt. 24:43-47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this text, when he speaks of his goods, he means the interests of his kingdom, which interests are on the earth. These faithful ones thus mentioned are therefore appointed by him and charged with the duty of doing God’s will on earth. Such is the work in which the Society is now engaged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What then is the will of God concerning these, and the work that they shall now do! The great event to which Christians have been looking forward since the day of Pentecost has been, and is, the second coming of Christ and the setting up of the kingdom of God under Christ. In his answer to the question as to when that time would begin, Jesus mentioned certain events that would prove its beginning; and these events began to come to pass in 1914. The coming to pass of these events proving that the second presence of the Lord had taken place, and that the kingdom was at hand, constituted and is good news to all who love the Lord God. The word “gospel” means good news; hence the Lord Jesus, speaking to his “faithful and wise servant” class brought together when he comes to his temple, says: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” (Matt. 24:14) By these words the Lord outlines clearly a positive work that must be done by those who are of the temple of God and who yet remain on the earth. No Christian could be pleasing to the Lord who would fail or refuse to engage in that work as opportunity is afforded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From and after 1918 the Lord has been gathering together unto himself these faithful ones, and has been bringing them into a company called the “temple”, or “faithful servant” class, and which are otherwise designated in the Scriptures as the “remnant” of Zion, which is God’s organization. To this “remnant” the Lord commits the obligation and duty of delivering a testimony concerning his kingdom. (Rev. 12:17) These men and women forming this company must be, and will be, obedient to the commands of the Lord, and therefore their service unto the Lord must be and is wholly unselfish. Their work is not for money, not for office, nor for honor or plaudits from men. They work because they love God and love Christ, and rejoice to have some part in the vindication of God’s holy name. All of these that now prove faithful to the end will have a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s word and name, and their course of action will prove that God can and does have some men and women on earth that maintain and hold fast their integrity to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5"> under the most severe conditions. These now go forth to preach the gospel, and “preaching” means telling good news to others; and that is their entire work now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What is the purpose of having this company of people called “the Society” engaged in preaching the gospel or good news of the kingdom? The real purpose is to serve notice on the rulers and the peoples of the nations of earth, particularly those nations called “Christendom”, of God’s purpose of shortly vindicating his word and name, and to prove to all creation that he is the Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As soon as this witness work is done in obedience to the commandments of the Lord, then the final end of Satan’s world or organization will be here; and this end will be marked by the great battle of the day of God Almighty, otherwise called the “Battle of Armageddon”, that which Jesus designated as the worst time of tribulation or trouble the world has ever known; and he further states that there will never be another, because that battle will completely destroy Satan’s organization. (Matt. 24:21,22) Then immediately will follow the complete establishment of righteousness in all the earth. The government of Christ will take full control of the affairs of the world, and bring relief to the oppressed and blessings to the obedient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work that the Society is now engaged in is therefore kingdom work, because those who go to make up the Society are declaring the works and the praises of the Almighty God, and informing the people of the great benefit his kingdom will bring. For this reason the work of the Society is now the most important work that is being done on earth. It is God’s work, and therefore it is of the greatest importance. It must be done unselfishly, because no other motive would be acceptable to Jehovah and to the Lord Jesus as the great executive officer.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark2"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The work performed by God’s consecrated ones on the earth from A.D. 1879 to 1918 was foreshadowed by the things performed by Elijah the prophet. The Scriptural record is that Elisha was anointed and appointed in the room or place of Elijah to finish the work which Elijah had begun. Both Elijah and Elisha represent God’s chosen people, and represent the same people doing somewhat different work covering different periods of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In keeping with these pictures, in the year 1918 the work practically came to a stop, which was foreshadowed by Elijah’s being taken away. Something more than a year thereafter the work of God’s consecrated people, by his kind favor, took on a new lease. It was then that the Lord revealed to his people that there was yet much to be done. Those who were unselfishly devoted to God, and anxious to magnify his name, went forward to the work with a zeal peculiar to his house. It was later, to wit, in 1922, that the church saw for the first time that Christ Jesus had come to the temple of God, and now all of God’s approved ones must engage in a work of advertising the King and the kingdom as the opportunity to do so was offered them. Consequently the Society’s work was organized for the first time on a more systematic and efficient basis. The followers of Christ began to see that God was not merely preparing a people to take to heaven, but was taking out a people for his name, to be his witnesses particularly at the end of the world. It was more clearly seen that “this gospel of the kingdom’’ must be preached to the nations as a witness before the final end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To do this work it was necessary to manufacture many books and booklets. To hire all of the printing work would mean a high cost of the product to the people, and therefore make it impossible for the people to have the very message that God purposed they should have. The Society then set about to build printing plants for the manufacture of books and other literature required. The factory was built at Brooklyn and fully equipped with the latest improved machinery for printing and manufacturing books. And now in this factory it is possible to turn out twenty thousand bound books of 368 pages each in one working day. Another factory was built at Magdeburg, Germany, and still another in Berne, Switzerland. These factories provide the publications in the various languages used in Continental Europe and other parts of the earth. The result is that today this gospel of the kingdom is published in as many as thirty-six languages, and the message has been put in the hands of many people in all the lands of so-called “Christendom”. The nations are therefore having the witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because the work of manufacturing books is done by the hands of men and women who are devoted to God and his cause, and who are not seeking financial gain, and because of exercising the strictest economy in buying the material and manufacturing the literature and books, and, above all, because of the blessing of the Lord, these books are published and placed in the hands of the people at a very nominal cost. The Society now publishes the following clothbound books: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God, Deliverance, Creation, Reconciliation, Government, Life, Prophecy,</span><span class="font5"> Book One and Book Two of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light;</span><span class="font5"> and in addition thereto, the following small books paper covered: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Our Lord’s Return, Hell, Where Are the Dead? Last Days, Prosperity Sure, Oppression, Judgment, Crimes and Calamities, War or Peace? Prohibition and League of Nations, Talking with the Dead, Millions Now Living Will Never Die, World Distress: Why? Desirable Government, Comfort for the People, Comfort for the Jews, Standard for the People, Freedom for the Peoples, The Peoples Friend;</span><span class="font5"> and additional thereto, publishes </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age, </span><span class="font5">all of these containing the message of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since 1922 in particular the work has gone steadily forward and increased every year, and it will be found upon examination of the report for 1930 that it is the best year yet. Nineteen hundred and twenty-nine was a year of material prosperity, comparatively speaking, whereas 1930 has been a year of much depression; and yet the work of the Lord’s people in proclaiming the message of the kingdom has increased. Every one of the above books was written and published between the years of 1921 and 1930. At the close of the year 1929 the total number of these books that have been placed in the hands of the people in different languages was, to wit, 77,452,360. Add to this number the total of publications placed in the hands of the people for the year 1930, and you will begin to have some conception of the tremendous work that has been done in the past ten years by a few people collectively called “the Society” or God’s “servant”. No man-made organization could possibly accomplish such work. Only the Lord could accomplish this result, and this ne has done through his consecrated people, because each one of them has appreciated the privilege now of obeying the Lord and sees that it is the will of God that this gospel of the kingdom must go to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To be sure, the work must be done orderly, and to this end the organization has been made as nearly perfect as imperfect men can make it; and by the Lord’s grace it is working to his glory. For this reason it is confidently stated that the Society forms a part of God’s organization to carry on his work, and that it is the only visible part of his organization now on the earth. This is not boasting of any man, nor manmade arrangement, but it is boasting in the Lord, because all who are of the Society realize that by themselves they can accomplish nothing, but by the Lord’s grace and by his spirit his work can and will be accomplished.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>OPPOSITION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Satan the Devil is the great enemy of God, and therefore the enemy of all who love God and serve him. His purpose and scheme has ever been to keep the people in ignorance of the truth, and to do this he has constantly resorted to fraud and deception. Satan is the god of this world, and by deceiving the masses of the people as well as their leaders, he has builded a powerful organization. His organization constitutes his “seed” because they do his bidding. It is to be expected that this organization of Satan’s would vigorously oppose the proclamation of the truth being made by representatives of Jehovah. The opposition is constantly made manifest, and all doubt of its source disappears when the Scriptures are understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah points out in his Word that 'the seed of the serpent ’ is the organization of Satan, made up of wicked spirit creatures which are invisible to man, and the visible rulers of this world, to wit, the commercial, political and religious elements combined, which rule and control the people. Jehovah states in his Word that there would be deadly enmity between the seed of promise and the seed of the serpent. (Gen. 3:15) This enmity could not be made manifest in such a marked degree until God’s “seed” had come into prominence, and until the seed of Satan is arrayed against that seed. The seed of promise began to be made manifest in a marked degree in 1914, when Jehovah placed his beloved Son upon his throne, and the seed of the serpent has shown special enmity against the people of God since that date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus stated in plain language that the clergy among the Jews were the offspring of Satan, the Devil. Those were the men that Satan used to persecute and oppose Jesus. The counterpart of those men consists of the clergy of the present day, particularly of the nations called “Christendom”. Added to these are those who have been brought to a knowledge of the truth and who have become lawless and joined themselves to Satan’s organization. These are all of the seed of Satan because they are blinded to the truth and permit themselves to be used to oppose those who are feeding the truth to the people, and by their opposition these help to keep the people in darkness. Those who received a knowledge of the truth from and after 1879 and who did not receive the love of the truth became lawless. To receive the love of the truth means that one must be unselfishly devoted to Jehovah’s cause. One who has a selfish motive in serving Jehovah, such as a selfish desire to get to heaven and help to rule the universe and to shine, could not be entirely devoted to God’s cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All such who have refused to obey the commandments of the Lord to preach this gospel of the kingdom, and who have set themselves in opposition to such work, have fallen easy victims to Satan, and have been the most violent opposers of the work of the Society. They are better equipped to oppose, because their wits have been sharpened. This opposition to the work of the Society is one of the best evidences that the Society’s work is of the Lord and has the Lord’s approval, and here are submitted some scriptures in support of that conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan reproached and defamed God’s name from the very beginning of man’s history. He has ever been a slanderer of God, and his name Devil signifies that he is a slanderer. He has laid malicious charges and slanders against Jehovah at all times. When Jesus came to earth to do the work that God sent him to do, it is written concerning him, “The reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.” (Ps. 69:9) A reproach is a malicious slander placed against the good name and work of another, the object being to do injury both to the creature and to the work. Those who have become the obedient children of God and have put forth their best endeavors to faithfully serve God and follow in the footsteps of Jesus have been and are subjected to the same reproaches or persecutions that fell upon Jehovah and upon Christ Jesus. “For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.” (Rom. 15:3) These also are slandered by the Devil and his representatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To his faithful followers Jesus gave warning in these words: “If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.” (John 15:18-20) Without a question of doubt Jesus spoke these words for the encouragement of those who would be faithfully following in his footsteps; and knowing these truths, those who are privileged to be a part of the Society, or God’s visible organization, do not permit slanders or reproaches to retard their efforts in doing the Lord’s work. Rather they take these things as a proof from the Lord that they are doing his work. That the true and faithful followers of Jesus might be encouraged to go on in the face of opposition, it is further written in his Word: “In the world ye shall have tribulation.” (John 16:33) “We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom.” (Acts 14:22) “Unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake.” (Phil. 1:29) “If we suffer, we shall also reign with him.” (2 Tim. 2:12) As a further encouragement it is written for these: “If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of gloiy and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified. ’ ’—1 Pet. 4:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In harmony with these texts, God’s true people forming the Society love not the world, neither the things that are in the world, but their love is wholly devoted to Jehovah and his righteous kingdom. These are for Christ and his kingdom, and they appreciate what the Lord has stated in his Word, that all that are against his work are anti-Christ or anti-kingdom, and therefore anti-God. This includes those who once claimed to serve God and who fell away. Those who continue faithful and true see the organization of Satan arrayed against the organization of Jehovah God. They clearly see the issue and delight to have their stand on the side of the Lord and to proclaim his message. To such the Lord through his Word says: “Ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.” (1 John 2:20) This means that they are appointed and anointed of God to do his work, and they know all the things that pertain to the issue. They see the evil organization on one side, and the righteous organization on the other, and are determined by God’s grace to go on in the proclamation of his truth, regardless of all opposition. For this reason they are diligently engaging in preaching this gospel of the kingdom, and because of their faithfulness in so doing, are being persecuted; and that persecution is coming from those who claim to be Christians but who are not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Both the Scriptures and the physical facts therefore concur in proving that the Society, otherwise called the “servant”, constitutes the visible representative of the Lord’s kingdom on earth at this time, and therefore a part of his visible organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore, the Society is not trying to get converts or to build up an organization by taking in members. Its sole mission is to preach this gospel of the kingdom, and thereby to advise the people that Jehovah is the only true God and that his kingdom is the only remedy for the many ills of humankind. The Society teaches the people the truth, and nothing else but the truth. This being the work that the Lord has commanded must be done, everyone who has faith in him will know that the work will continue until his will is accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Below a brief statement is made of the doctrines set forth in the literature distributed by the Society in order that the fundamental truths as taught in the Bible may be seen. No doctrine of any man is taught. No theories of any man are taught; but each point is completely supported by the Word of the Lord, so that anyone can prove for himself whether or not it is true.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>DOCTRINES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Bible is God’s Word of truth, as Jesus stated in so many terms. In brief its teachings or doctrines are, to wit: That the great Creator of heaven and earth is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">God,</span><span class="font5"> and that he has revealed himself in his Word by that name; that he also reveals himself by his name </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah,</span><span class="font5"> which means his purpose concerning his creatures; and as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Almighty</span><span class="font5"> God, meaning that his power is without limitation; and as the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Most High, </span><span class="font5">meaning that he is above all.-Isa. 42:5,8; Ps. 91:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work of the Society is not propaganda. It does not seek to put forth the views or doctrines of man or any company of men. It propagates nothing of its own. It calls attention only to the great truths of the Bible, which is God’s Word. It seeks neither men nor money. It realizes it can bring nobody in, nor put anybody out of God’s kingdom. The mission of the Society is to be the witness to God’s name as commanded. (Isa. 43:10-12) In doing this the Society is seeking to do good to mankind, because it shows the people the only way that leads to peace and life, and the blessings incident thereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those composing the Society are fully convinced that the time has come for the fulfilment of Revelation 22:17, which reads: “And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come: and whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.” Jehovah God is the great Spirit, and Christ Jesus is his express image. “The bride” is a name applied to the body members of Christ. Now Jehovah and Christ Jesus cause the message of truth to be proclaimed in the earth, that those who hear it may come and take their stand on the side of God and Christ. The Society, being the “servant” of the Lord, is privileged to join in the invitation inviting all others who love righteousness and hate iniquity to come and take their stand on the side of the Lord and take up the glad message of truth and herald it to others. The kingdom of heaven is here, and the day of deliverance is at hand. God’s time is here for the people to know the truth, and he will see that they have an opportunity to know it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The foregoing are the reasons for the Society’s existing. There would be no other just cause or excuse why such, should be on earth at this time. All are aware of the fact that the world is in great stress, trouble and perplexity. There is even greater distress just ahead, and God will have this made known, and it is the privilege and delight of those who love him to be obedient to his commandments and make known to mankind the fact that his kingdom will straighten, out all the crooked things of the earth and bring lasting peaee and life to the peoples of earth that obey him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year the Society sent out men as its special representatives. These are ordained to preach the gospel of God’s kingdom and to represent the Society in its work, having special authority thus to do.

<p><span class="font5">Following the usual custom, the Society held its annual meeting for 1930, the proceedings of which are set forth below:</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>ANNUAL MEETING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The charter of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society and its by-laws provide that a meeting shall be held once each year. The same authority provides, however, that the election of a board of directors and officers of the corporation shall take place only every three years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pursuant to the charter and its by-laws, the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society convened at its annual meeting at Carnegie Hall, North Side Pittsburgh (formerly Allegheny), on Friday the 31st day of October A.D. 1930. There were present a number of the members of the “Society”. The meeting was called to order by the president and opened with appropriate devotional services including song and prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There being no servants or officers of the corporation to be elected at this annual meeting, the meeting was held more particularly for the encouragement of the brethren who have to do with the Lord’s work. While neither the charter nor by-laws require an annual report to be made, it has been customary for some years to have such report prepared by the president. On the occasion above mentioned, the president presented his annual report, and on motion duly put and carried it was ordered that it should be printed for the benefit of those who are connected with the “Society”. The report appears below.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>THE PRESIDENT’S REPORT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">To </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">the Remnant:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God has a small number of his anointed ones on the earth at the present time. These he designates as the “remnant” of Zion. The “Society” is composed of that “remnant”, because it is made up of those who are wholly devoted to God and to his cause, and who serve him with a pure heart. The fiscal year of 1930 having closed, it is my privilege and joy to make report of the activities during the year, that all of the remnant may together rejoice because of the abundant evidence God has furnished that he is with his people. The work of the remnant is in connection with the temple of God; and as Jehovah said to those building the typical temple, so he now says to the remnant, “I am with you, saith the Lord.” (Hag. 1:13) That assurance from the Most High should thrill every worker. The proof is conclusive that the work in which the temple class is engaged is God’s work; and if those of the remnant have been faithful to opportunities offered during the year, then be assured that the result is exactly as God would have it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God is carrying on a campaign of education in the world. The head of that campaign organization is his beloved Son Christ Jesus. With him the risen saints are doing their part. On the earth the remnant of the seed of God’s organization is participating in the campaign, and is charged with the obligation to do certain portions of the work in connection therewith. You will be keenly interested to know just how the work has progressed during the year. In this campaign the remnant is but carrying out God’s positive commandments. Among his commandmerits is this one, &quot;Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up,- cast Up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.”—Isa. 62:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The &quot;gates” here mentioned constitute the entrance to God’s organization. Those who &quot;go through the gates” do so to the praise of Jehovah. &quot;The Lord loveth the gates of Zion.” (Ps. 87: 2) Devoted to the service and praise of Jehovah the remnant joyfully obey the commandment to go through the gates, inviting those who will to come and take of the water of life freely, and take their stand on the side of Jehovah. Realizing that Jehovah God has become salvation to each one of them, the remnant says: &quot;Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the Lord: this gate of the Lord, into which the righteous shall enter. I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation. ” —Ps. 118:19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Prepare ye the way of the people”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is one part of the campaign work. The people must be informed and educated in the truth. They know little about the Bible, and it is God’s will that his remnant shall now give them some information. The people must be told that Jehovah is the only true God, and that he alone can bring life everlasting, and the blessings incident thereto; that Christ Jesus is earth’s rightful King, and that his kingdom is at hand; that Jehovah has a mighty organization by and through which he operates; that Satan has a powerful organization, and that soon Satan’s organization will be completely destroyed, the oppression of the people broken, and the name of Jehovah God vindicated; and that this great work will be done with God’s elect servant, the Christ. The people must be prepared to receive the kingdom, so that there will be some of them at least who, when they see Satan’s organization falling, will know that it is God’s power that is accomplishing this work, and that their own deliverance has come, and that it is their privilege to obey, serve and praise Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Cast up the highway”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are not divers and numerous ways to return to God, as the clergymen have falsely told the people. There is but one way, and that way is God’s way. It is righteous and true. The truth makes that way clear to the vision of those who obey the truth. This is God’s highway which he has provided for those who will be reconciled to him. The testimony concerning that highway must be given to the people now. The remnant is commissioned to do that work, and such is a part of this campaign of education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Gather out the stones”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The enemy, by and through his agents, the clergy in particular, has planted many hindrances in the way of the people’s knowing the truth. These hindrances are likened unto stumbling stones that cause the people to stumble and fall, and turn away from God. One of these stones is that concerning ‘man’s ability to bring relief and peace to himself by and through such a makeshift as the League of Nations’. That and all like stones must be removed from hindering those who will now hear and obey the truth. It is the duty and the privilege of the remnant to bear this testimony of truth to the people; and this is a part of the campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Lift up a standard for the people”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God in his loving-kindness is now causing this standard to be lifted up. He will demonstrate to the people that he is all-powerful and the only true God. Therefore he commands the remnant to go and tell the people his truth. For this reason he says to the “servant” class, “Ye are my witnesses, that I am God.” The standard lifted up is not man’s standard; it is God’s standard. It shows the people the right way to go. Nothing else can show them the right way. The privilege of lifting up this standard for the people is now given to the “servant” of the Lord yet on earth, and which is otherwise designated the “remnant”. It is an invitation to the people to rally to the standard of Jehovah and to take their stand on his side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This campaign is not carried on for the purpose of getting anyone into heaven, not even the remnant. The purpose of the campaign is to bear testimony of God’s purposes to the rulers and to the people, and only those who now faithfully and joyfully do bear these fruits of the kingdom before the rulers and the people will ever be taken to heaven. Jehovah will shortly vindicate his word and his name; and of this the people must be informed. The “servant” class has that privilege. This good news of the kingdom must now be preached before the final end comes, even as the Lord has given commandment. (Matt. 24:14) The ‘faithful servant’ class will do this work. The remnant is a part of the ‘faithful servant’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Under the direction of the Lord preparation was made for the campaign, and for some time now the campaign has been in full sway. The Lord provided for the manufacture of books at the lowest possible cost, and the people are getting the advantage of this provision. The Society’s plant at Brooklyn has been operating during the entire fiscal year with full speed. Likewise the plants in Germany and Switzerland have been running at full capacity, as the examination of the details of this report will show.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The order of the campaign is this: The literature, consisting of magazines, pamphlets, booklets and books, is first prepared in manuscript form, then printed and manufactured and shipped to the field. The radio broadcasts the message of truth, and thus the people are informed that the Lord’s campaign workers are on the way. Then the workers carry the message in printed form to the doors of the homes of the people and deliver a personal testimony to each one who will hear, at the same time exhibiting the books or other literature, and if these are wanted they are left with the people of the house, and then the worker marches on to the next.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this manner the people are being educated, and the praises of Jehovah are being heard amongst the nations and the peoples of earth. The singing begun must continue until Armageddon has done the work completely of ousting the enemy organization for ever. This is the campaign preliminary to the setting up of the kingdom and the beginning of operation of a righteous government on earth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>COURAGEOUS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">“Gourage” means to confidently go forward in an assigned duty or work, knowing that there is serious opposition in the way, but at the same time relying implicitly on the power that is behind the work assigned. During the year the remnant has been showing real courage. These know that Jehovah is with them, that the work is his, and that Christ is leading them in the campaign. They confidently rely upon the Lord, and are of good courage regardless of any danger or opposition. They appreciate the promise of Jehovah, that he will furnish all the needed protection: “Because he [the remnant or servant] hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.”—Ps. 91:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year the opposition has increased, but this has not at all dampened the ardor or beat down the courage of God’s faithful ones. Much opposition has been manifested by the clergy of so-called “organized Christianity”, and these have instituted their bitter opposition against the remnant. This is exactly as the Lord foretold it would be, because Satan is mad at God’s organization and seeks the destruction of the remnant of her seed. (Rev. 12:17) The clergy has caused the arrest of many of the brethren, and numerous cases have had to be tried in the courts. The brethren have been charged with the breaking of the Sunday law, or with selling goods and merchandise without a license.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To be sure, these charges are false, but they are made just the same; and those against whom they are laid are reminded that Jesus also was falsely charged. He also says to his faithful ones: ‘The servant is not greater than the master. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you.’ None of the Lord’s workers are peddlers in any sense. These workers are not doing a commercial business at all, and surely none that is in any wise in competition with anyone else. Everyone who loves the Lord and serves him delights to welcome everyone else to engage in the same thing. They are not attempting to make money, nor seeking members of an organization, but are devoting themselves exclusively to carrying out the commandments of Jehovah. As God’s children they are authorized and commissioned to preach the gospel regardless of any day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has always been customary in America to preach the gospel on Sunday. It is wholly inconsistent to arrest anyone who is going about proclaiming God’s kingdom on the day called “Sunday”. Of course, we know this is the result of the laws of the organization of this world. That opposition and persecution must of necessity come, that the faithful ones might have tribulation. However, these questions must be fought out, because it is surely the Lord’s will that his servants shall not lie supinely on their backs when persecuted, and fail to go on in the witness work. Having full confidence in God they press forward in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sometimes, when one is putting forth his best endeavor to serve, and is tired and worn and weary, and then is held up by some officer and dragged into court, he may wonder why God permits such persecution and opposition. But is it not true that this opposition draws the attention of the people to God’s witnesses, and this makes them a spectacle or a witness for the Lord?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The remnant realize that the Lord is at the head of this campaign, and knows all about the opposition, and can break it to pieces at any time he sees fit. The fact that he permits it to go on must be for some good purpose for the remnant. With full confidence and with renewed courage, the remnant press on and do the work. They are determined to go forward with it until it is done, regardless of any or all opposition. Those who love the Lord realize that they must be obedient to “the higher powers”, and “the higher powers” means Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, and such other parts of God’s organization to which he has committed the direction of his work, such as the apostles. Warned of opposition and knowing it will come, the faithful are not surprised when it does come. Surely the Lord must have caused Peter long ago towrite these words for the benefit and encouragement of those who are now going about preaching the gospel of the kingdom. “Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified. ’’—1 Pet. 4:12-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year the Lord has revealed to his faithful ones and properly identified to them “the man of sin’’, and has shown that such constitute really the most subtle instrument in the hand of the great opposer of God’s work. This is the “evil servant” class, and it employs Satan’s methods to accomplish the desired results. Just as the apostle long ago warned: ‘By good words and fair speeches they deceive the simple.’ (Rom. 16:18) “The man of sin” claims to be anointed of God and therefore to constitute the Christ. Such is the false Christ of which Jesus warned and which he foretold would appear in this very day. (Matt. 24:24) Claiming to be doing God’s service, yet the evil servants never do anything in the way of carrying the message of the kingdom to the people in obedience to God’s commandments. Subtly they put forth opposition to those who are really serving the Lord in accordance with his com-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">mandments. They exercise an influence over the simple that causes them to fall into the trap of Satan, and these are induced to believe a lie rather than to believe the truth. The Lord will have his work done, and on time, and of that there cannot be the slightest doubt. The simple will be deceived, but the faithful will not be deceived by the subtle influence of “the man of sin”. The remnant, being of the elect servant, will be faithful and true, and will be completely victorious, because, as it is written, the servant is blind to everything except the work which the Lord has given the servant to do. The report from the field workers during the year shows that this scripture has been proven in many instances by such faithful ones.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>BOUNTIFUL TABLE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">True to his promise, Jehovah has made a bountiful provision for his servant class. “Thou prepares! a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.” (Ps. 23:5) While opposition put forward by the enemy has increased during the year and many have fallen away under such opposition, at the same time Jehovah has graciously laid upon his table for his servant class an abundance of life-sustaining food. </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font5">ong other things, he has shown the servant class particularly what is meant by ‘bearing the fruits of the kingdom’; that the fruits of the kingdom are God’s fruits, and not man’s; and that it is our privilege to carry or bear these life-sustaining fruits to others, that they too might know God’s word and his name, and take their stand on the side of the Lord. Our part in this campaign, in connection with the fruits, is to bear such fruits to others; and only those who faithfully bring forth these fruits of the kingdom can ever hope to be of the kingdom, because Jesus so stated.—Matt. 21:43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year the Lord has also given his people a clear vision of his own organization, and a plainer exhibition of Satan’s organization. This meat in due season has enabled the faithful to make straight paths for their feet, and to march always forward and on the Lord’s side, doing the work assigned. The enemy has not been able to deceive and will not be able to deceive these, because they faithfully hear and obey the commandments of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For many years God’s people have diligently sought to understand Revelation. Now, by his grace, that understanding is given to them. The servant class fully realizes that all honor and praise is due to the great God of the universe for this provision bountifully made. He gave the revelation to Jesus Christ, and instructed him that in due time he should make it known to the remnant class on earth. That time is here, and God’s people greatly rejoice, take courage and give praise to the great Jehovah and continue to press the battle to the gate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The numerous letters received at this office express the great joy of the writers because of the understanding of Revelation. It is impossible to take the time to answer all these letters, even though there is a keen desire to do so. Let the writers of such letters know that their cooperation is fully appreciated, and take this as a reply to their letters: Together we rejoice and give praise to God that he has been pleased to spread upon his table at this time the understanding of Revelation. We can now see where God’s people stand, and wherein we have been walking in the past few years. By Revelation the Lord has given his people a full assurance that they are doing his work, and even though it is so imperfectly done on their part, his blessing is upon it. And now let us show our love for him by speedily carrying out his orders, and proceed with the campaign work with all haste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year the president’s office, including all the assistants therein, has been busily engaged in the campaign. There is always much to do; and the doing of that work brings real joy to those who participate. The work during the year speaks for itself, and you will know concerning that work, as set forth in this report, that this office has had something to do with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year loving hands provided a comfortable house pleasantly situated at San Diego, California, wherein the president and his office assistants can escape the rigors of the winter and there be enabled to go on with the work. This provision is graciously acknowledged as from the Lord. He knows who are the givers, and will bless them accordingly. The title to that house is in the Society, and is held in trust for the perpetual use of God’s faithful ones. It was thought appropriate to give a name to the house, and henceforth it will be known by the name “Beth-Sarim”. This is a compound Hebrew word, and its meaning is “house of the princes”, and is intended for the princes mentioned by the Lord. It is confidently expected that in God’s due time some of the faithful men mentioned in Hebrews 11, and whom Christ shall “make princes in all the earth”, will find an abode in that house while carrying on the work the Lord will give them to do. The house is a small matter, but it reminds us that there is a direct and close relationship between all the creatures that are truly devoted to God. Some blessed day all of God’s creation who are faithful will be gathered to-getter into one family under Christ his beloved One. (Eph. 1:10) To what extent the Lord will use the houses his people have built on earth in the past few years is for him to decide, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are always glad, however, to believe, according to his Word, that he is pleased to have bis people recognize the close relationship between all that love God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The enemy gave wide publication of and concerning the building of that house at San Diego. The purpose of the enemy, of course, was to bring reproach upon the work of the Society. Others have given friendly mention of the house through the public press. The publication which has spread over the earth has served to let the people know that there are some on earth who have full faith and confidence in God and his promises, and see that his kingdom is at hand, and that in his kingdom he will have faithful men on earth to represent him. The mere amount of publication could not have been bought for five times the cost of the house. This is another evidence of the fact that the enemy often overreaches himself and never succeeds in accomplishing a real purpose. In the days of the early church the apostle wrote: “Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife, and some also of good will: the one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds.” (PhiL 1:15,16) It is even so today. The campaign of education goes grandly on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bethel (meaning “the house of God”) holds a joyful family. The members of this family deeply appreciate the privilege that God has given to them and the provision he has so graciously made for them, both temporal and spiritual. There are millions of people of the world today that are out of employment and find it difficult to provide the necessary food and raiment for themselves. The family at Bethel is amply provided for in these things. During the year the Lord has blessed our gardens, and the family of two hundred and upward has fed upon the vegetables produced in these gardens, for a period of four months, and has preserved much for the winter ahead. This has been true, and so manifestly a blessing of the Lord, while many other fields round about have produced little or nothing. The Lord has blessed his people here with reasonable health, in view of their years, and enabled them to get on with the work given them. Believing it to be the will of God that his workers should get the best possible results out of the organism which one possesses, and that the physical condition aids in accomplishing this work, the Society has made arrangement for the growing of vegetables during the winter in the South, and for the shipping of them to the Bethel family. We take this as a provision of the Lord for his own, and give him the th</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">anks</span><span class="font5"> and glory therefor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Berean studies of the family are a real blessing from the Lord. Because of lack of space it is impossible to invite others aside from the family to participate in these studies. Practically everyone of the home assembles at these meetings, and the keenest interest is manifested, and a keen effort is put forth to get a better understanding of God’s provision for his own. We must acknowledge this special blessing from the Lord which has been particularly manifest during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Prayer and testimony meetings are also a real favor and blessing from the Lord. These are held regularly in the Bethel home, using the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book </span><span class="font5">each day, and the text for Wednesday for the prayer meeting text, and adhering to the text at such meetings, and all receive much comfort and consolation and good therefrom. The morning devotion by radio and the morning devotion in the dining room start the day aright. The Bethel family appreciate as never before how the members thereof are the special recipients of God’s favor, and each one goes forth to the work of the day physically, mentally and spiritually qualified to perform the duties in the campaign that have been assigned to him or her. The work progresses and the Lord is praised.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>PRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Now your attention is invited to the Brooklyn office and factory, situated at 117 Adams Street, where the literature is produced in printed form for distribution amongst the peoples and nations of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fiscal year is from October 1, 1929, to September 30, 1930. The brethren who are privileged to work at this office and factory desire me to express for them their deep appreciation of the privilege of having to do with the kingdom interest committed into their hands. They are indeed a joyful company, and the machines upon which they work make sweet music to the ears of the anointed. It is necessary to see them actually at work to appreciate this statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year it was necessary to increase the machinery for the production of the factory. Six new machines were purchased and installed. The demand for books in the English language has kept our presses so busy during the year that it has been impossible to supply all the demand of other languages as fast as they were needed Because of this increased demand it is deemed advisable to have another large jpress manufactured, and installed, and this has been ordered; and it is hoped that within the next six months it will he in operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Boasting in the Lord, we can truly say that the factory at 117 Adams Street is one of the best equipped and most up-to-date printing plants on earth. It is not the largest, of course, but it is well arranged and economically and efficiently operated. Visitors at the plant express their great astonishment at the accomplishment of the young men who work at the machines and turn out the work that they see. Of course, worldly men cannot understand the real reason; but we know it is the spirit of the Lord put upon these brethren that enables them to accomplish what they do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year these brethren have worked 268 days, putting in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8½</span><span class="font5"> hours each day. In these days the factory turned out an average of 14,127 clothbound books and 12,571 booklets daily. The factory was closed three times during the year to enable the brethren to participate in the field service, and after producing the books, these brethren and other members of the family during the year placed in the hands of the people 22,622 thereof. It was necessary to work some extra time in the latter part of July and the first of August in order to meet the demand and to prepare for the beginn</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ing</span><span class="font5">g of the campaign with the books </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font5"> and the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Prohibition.</span><span class="font5"> During this extra period the brethren worked </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11½</span><span class="font5"> hours a day, and the average daily work was something above 20,000 clothbound volumes and 37,500 booklets a day. There was no complaint from anyone because of working “overtime”, because there is no such expression amongst the Lord’s people here. They were anxious to have some part in getting the message to the people, which the Lord has pointed out must be done speedily.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>MATERIAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The raw material purchased and used by the Brooklyn factory during the year amounts to this: 1,144 tons of book paper, 281 tons of paper for making booklets, 108 tons for the publication of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font5"> and 70 tons of paper for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower. </span><span class="font5">This is a total of 1,603 tons of paper, or an increase of 73 tons over the year 1929. In addition thereto, there were 231 tons of cardboard used for book covers, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">making</span><span class="font5"> a total of 1,834 tons of book and binding material It would require 114 American freight cars to haul this paper, which would make a good-sized trainload. Of course, if these were such cars as are used in Europe, it would require about four times that number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to this material there were 309,379 yards of cloth used for binding the books, or an increase of 57,351 yards over that used in 1929; also 55,820 yards of crash used in the binding, 820 spools of thread used for the sewing, 2,569 rolls of gold tape used in the letter stamping, 130 barrels of paste for the pasting of the books, and 17,962 pounds of glue. In addition to that, the ink used was manufactured in our own plant, and also the paint used for the painting of the buildings. Our own plant manufactured and used 23,021 pounds of ink and 129 gallons of paint. This material was used in the printing and manufacturing of books and booklets, some of them in as many as sixteen different languages, in this factory; and the publications issued during the year were, to wit:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It will be recalled that the year 1929 was a prosperous year compared with the year of 1930 just closed. Although millions of people are without employment and there has been a great amount of crop failure throughout this land, it will be seen that there has been an increased production and distribution of the Society’s literature during the year 1930. There is only one explanation thereof; and that is, that the Lord is with his people as he has promised, and the work being done is his work, and he prospers it according to his own good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the office manager’s report the following quotation is made:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The production of clothbound books shows an increase over 1929, whereas the booklets show a decrease. This decrease in the quantity of booklets was due mainly to the fact that the Society issued no 5¢ booklet during the year, and secondly, because the booklets were not stressed as much as were the books. However, in recent months the booklets have been going very fine. Since May, 1930, the friends have been pushing the 9-for-50^ booklet combination because of the hard times and distressing conditions in this country, but even with the demand in recent months the booklets did not come up to last year’s production.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“At the close of last year the Society had a very large quantity of booklets on hand, but this stock has been depleted, due to the rapid movement of tencent booklets during the last five months, as shown in the distribution report. We distributed 4,752,023 booklets, whereas it was necessary to print only 3,374,461. The comparative report for the past four years’ production in the Brooklyn printing plant is quite interesting:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“In addition to the above production, the smaller presses in the factory printed 3,940,078 radio fliers, question slips, handbills, question cards and different odd jobs that were requested. These pieces of literature carrying the message of the kingdom, and also an advertisement of the chain hook-up and Brother Rutherford’s publications, were distributed from door to door. These small presses also printed 2,646,245 office forms, circular letters and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“It is most gratifying to see such a splendid increase in the production of clothbound books. During the year 1929 the part of the factory producing the clothbound books was working at capacity, and it is only due to the fact that new machines were installed during the last year that this increase of 213,673 books was made possible. Most of this increase was brought about during the last five months of the fiscal year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The entire production of the factory is really a tremendous amount of work accomplished, when one considers that there are only 140 brethren working at 117 Adams Street. Of these, 54 brethren are kept busy in the office, looking after the work in the colporteur and service departments, answering correspondence, looking after the radio work, proofreading, handling </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> subscriptions, bookkeeping, invoicing all orders, working on foreign translations and handling correspondence in languages other than the English, and taking care of the work in the accounting department and circulation department. Nine other brethren handle the shipping of the books and booklets to the colporteurs, classes and foreign branches. This leaves 77 brethren who work in the factory and produce the books and booklets, as outlined in the production report. These brethren operate the linotype machines, setting up type in all languages, do the work of the composing department, plate-making department, operating of the presses, printing of the booklet covers and colored pictures for the books, running the stitching machines, and gathering, assembling and sewing, cutting and trimming of the books, booklets, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age.</span><span class="font5"> They make the covers, and put the covers on the books and pack them in cartons ready for shipment. We wish that all the brethren could just for an hour or two see this organization that the Lord has brought about and so wonderfully blessed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The books manufactured and produced at the 117 Adams Street factory during the year 1930 are, to wit: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God, Deliverance, Creation, Reconciliation, Government, Life, Prophecy, Light</span><span class="font5"> Book One, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font5"> Book Two, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font5"> 1930, miscellaneous foreign, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott, Song Book</span><span class="font5"> in paper, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Crimes and Calamities, War or Peace, Oppression, Judgment, The Last Days, Prosperity Sure, Hell, Our Lord’s Return, Where Are the Dead, The Peoples Friend, Prohibition.</span></p>

Letters and cards dispatched, 248,400. Tins shows a decided increase over the previous year. This means that a tremendous amount of correspondence must be done each and every day. There was an average of 1,014 letters received daily, and an average of 927 dispatched, during these 268 days.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">There can scarcely be any doubt about the fact that the Lord brought forth the radio at this particular time for the purpose of reaching the “prisoner” class. These have been kept in the denominational systems, and away from the table of the Lord, because the “prison keepers”, the clergy, have selfishly browbeaten and kept them there. Now these are privileged to remain quietly in their homes, undisturbed by collection boxes and unhindered by the threatening words of the clergy, and listen to a plain statement of the truth. This is Jehovah’s provision for them; and the more they know of the truth, the more they will appreciate what he has done, and the greater will be their love for him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In addition to this, on April 27 a nation-wide broadcast was had, with the program originating with radio station KROW, at Oakland, California, and distributed over 53 radio st</span><span class="font5">ations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Radio station WBBR, main studios of which are now located at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, broadcasts every day except Saturday. This continuous proclamation of the truth has shown its splendid results in the New York area within that period of time. The New York congregation is small in number, but the total of books and booklets placed in the hands of the people by this small congregation during the past year was, to wit, 233,686 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Without a doubt WBBR puts on the most consistent and pleasing program of any station in the New York area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Watch Tower has put on programs on approximately 150 stations throughout the United States, which programs have been produced by local classes. It has favorable contracts with a number of stations for broadcasting the truth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>EFFECTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This has, by the Lord’s grace, been one of the splendid means employed to make known to the peo-pie that Jehovah is God and that the kingdom of heaven is at hand. It has afforded an entry into the homes for the faithful men and women who have gone about preaching the gospel by means of the books and booklets. From the notes furnished this office by the Society’s radio department the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Literally countless are the expressions of appreciation received by the Society directly (from listeners) and indirectly (from thousands of field workers who have visited the homes of listeners).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“To the meek, the broken-hearted, mourning ones, the captives and the prisoners dwelling in darkness, the light of the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah has been dispensed through these weekly broadcasts. For such, good news, comfort, the oil of joy for mourning, have regularly descended as the gentle rain, bringing peace of mind and refreshment of heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘ ‘ To the lordly clergy, the principal of their flocks, and the other “goat-hearted” ones (who in one way or another have from time to time betrayed themselves as listeners), this incessant proclamation of the truth has verily been as a withering blight of hail. With ever-increasing sharpness, the taunts, denunciations, exposures, challenges, have bounded through space. Sore indeed, and grievous, in the ears of these sons of Satan has been the persistent declaration of the day of God’s vengeance. Their stealthy and subtle efforts to stop the broadcasting have failed utterly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“While this chain broadcasting establishment has served as a channel for direct distribution of the truth to the people, it has also been an effective tool, so to speak, for cultivating the field for the house-to-house witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Prejudice of many has been melted. An appetite for the printed message has been whetted, and when the ‘representative from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower’</span><span class="font5"> now presents himself (or herself) at the door of one who has been listening, a prompt and hearty welcome is extended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“On the other hand, the hardened enemy of the truth who has heard the radio message is also prompt to reveal his identity as an enemy when called upon at home, and thus the time of the house-to-house witness is conserved for pursuing his duty among those who have the ear to hear.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The cost for broadcasting the chain program during the year has been excessive. For the rent of wires alone for this service, the Society has expended $137,000, and in addition thereto, more than $60,000 for the station rentals. It is our hope that within another year many more people will be reached by radio than heretofore, and concerning this we shall expect to make report next year. In addition to broadcasting English programs by radio, brethren in the Society regularly broadcast Bible lectures in other languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> total of 8,722 programs, including the message of the kingdom in the English language, were broadcast over 152 stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Foreign-language programs also were broadcast, as follows:</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>PREACHING THE GOSPEL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society appreciates the fact that its mission is to preach the gospel of God’s kingdom. The Lord has come to his temple, and has anointed the approved ones and has given to them this commandment: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.’’ (Matt. 24:14) Furthermore, these are commanded by Jehovah, who has said: “Ye are my witnesses that I am God.” The only means whereby the Lord’s faithful children can prove their loving devotion to him is by keeping these commandments. Merely gathering together a handful of people and talking to them is not the most effective way of preaching the gospel in these days, by any means. Giving a testimony to a person long enough to induce him to read what is printed about the Lord’s kingdom is the most effective way. The radio has claimed the people’s attention. The message has been printed, and now someone must carry it to the people. The effective workers in this campaign are the ones who go from house to house and come in personal contact with the people and speak to them about God’s kingdom. These are not engaged in a propaganda work, of course, because they are not trying to propagate any man’s doctrine or the doctrine of any creature. They are merely telling the message that is in Jehovah’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the fiscal year of 1929 to 1930 there has been distributed amongst the people books and booklets manufactured at the Adams Street factory as follows, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Clothbound books in the English language, 3,165,870; in foreign languages, 204,793; or a total of 3,370,663. Of these books, upward of 75,000 people ordered directly through the mails. From the office manager’s distribution report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ Sometimes we hear it said that it is difficult to recanvass territory with the older books, but this has been proven wrong time and time again. In last year’s report it was shown that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God </span><span class="font5">led in the distribution, with 567,550 books. The same is true this year. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp</span><span class="font5"> again leads, with 543,175 copies distributed. This book has been in circulation since 1921.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The friends during the year received a blessing from the Lord when they received the new books </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font5"> 1 and 2. Before the fiscal year had ended, over 203,000 copies of each book had been distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Not only does the distribution of the dothbound books show a marked increase, but the ten-cent booklets show a phenomenal increase also. During the year we distributed 4,656,798 booklets in all languages, including English, whereas during the previous year we distributed 3,499,593 ten-cent booklets; showing a total increase this year of 1,157,205.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“One most interesting thing, as observed in the following report, in regard to the booklets, is how well the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Hell, Lord’s Return</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Where Are the Dead?</span><span class="font5"> booklets are being taken by the people. During 1929, in the English language alone, there were 832,746 distributed, whereas in 1930 there were 1,220,302 of these three booklets distributed; showing an increase of 387,556 in the English language. The same is true of these three booklets in the foreign languages. During 1929 there were 144,438 distributed, and in 1930, 199,104; or an increase of 54,666. This would seem to indicate that the people today are entirely dissatisfied with the explanation that the clergy have given on the subjects of Hell and Where are the dead? and are now looking for a dear and reasonable explanation of the same. They are also interested in our Lord’s return, and the kingdom which Christ will establish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Another interesting thing in regard to the tencent booklets is that since the nine booklets were offered for 50^ they have moved far more rapidly, and when comparing the shipment of ten-cent booklets with the quantity produced we find that we have shipped 1,292,434 more than were printed during the same period of time. This tremendous movement in booklets has consumed all our surplus stock, and toward the end of this fiscal year it has been difficult to keep all the nine booklets in stock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Comparing the total number of pieces of literature distributed, books and booklets, we find that there has been a decrease of 3,341,730 pieces. This, however, is due to the fact that last year, 1929, we distributed 4,959,662 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend</span><span class="font5"> booklets. There was no five-cent booklet published this year, and no special drive made on the booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The friends have also distributed quite a number of Bibles during the year. We shipped out 21,024 Bibles, as compared with 19,026 the previous year. A good many of these Bibles are being used in combinations and offered to the people for one dollar.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>THE WATCH TOWER</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> has for a number of years been the means the Lord has used to communicate its present truth to his consecrated people. During the past year </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> has published in each issue some life-sustaining food from the Lord’s table. The responses by the brethren who read it have been splendid, and show how much they enjoy what the Lord does for them. The average subscription list during the year has increased somewhat, and there have been a number of cancellations by those who have lost interest in the truth; but the net result is a few less than were subscribers for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> in 1929. This is exactly as we should expect it. The Lord is shaking out everything that can be shaken; but those that remain, because they cannot be shaken, are appreciating more the provision the Lord has made, and are getting much better results in the work that they are doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the leading article appearing in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font5"> it carries shorter articles that are suitable for broadcasting, besides other matters of interest and a few letters from the brethren. We are grateful to the Lord for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font5"> and glad to note the increased evidence of his favor upon it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE GOLDEN AGE</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> magazine, published by the Society, has during the year brought many interesting letters to this office from people who give evidence of having been benefited by its publication. It is not published for money, but is published for the good of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">mankind. There has been a healthy increase of the subscription list during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> staff has inaugurated a means of regaining subscriptions that had expired and been forgotten. A reminder is sent to the ex-subscriber in the form of two copies of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> magazine, with a post card or a letter calling their attention to the need to renew the subscription. This has regained several thousand subscribers. Many people have written in appreciation of the special reminder, and the figures show that 18 percent of those who do not resubscribe on their own accord do so as a result of that follow-up system.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>ACTIVITIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The work accomplished by the classes, sharpshooters, and colporteurs during the fiscal year shows that they have placed 2,057,282 clothbound books in the hands of the people, and 2,620,124 booklets of 64 pages. Casual examination of the report of 1930 will show a decrease over 1929, but that is due entirely to the five-cent booklet which was put out in 1929. Otherwise there is a healthy increase of the work for the year 1930.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the most encouraging features of the year’s work is the manner in which the brethren have responded to the service. During the year the average number of colporteurs reporting weekly was 1,751, while the average number of class workers was 4,375, a decided increase in the number of workers over the year previous. Not only was the increase in numbers, but more time was devoted to the work. During the fiscal year 2,419,597 hours were devoted to the work in the field, as compared with 1,933,704 of last year; or an increase of 485,893 hours. A more detailed statement follows:</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>HARD TIMES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The general cry during the past year, as all know, has been and is, “hard times.” That is literally true. There is a general depression of business, abnormal weather conditions, crop failures in many parts of the country, a great amount of unemployment, distress and perplexity. Many are of the opinion that under such conditions the literature concerning God’s kingdom would likewise decrease, but the exact contrary is the result. The year 1930 shows a decided increase over last year in the number of persons receiving literature. We must take into consideration the fact that when people are in prosperity they think less about the Lord, and when in adversity they want to know the reason why. God’s message is the only one that comforts their hearts. It is therefore the great privilege of his people to take this message to those who are in distress and mourning. The Lord foreknew this, and commissioned his people to do this very work. It may be said that the slight reduction in the amount taken for the books has had something to do with the number placed, but this is a small matter compared with the desire of the people to know the cause of their distress, and what is the remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This should be encouraging to the Lord’s people, many of whom would be out of employment themselves were it not for the fact that the Lord has given them some chance to preach the gospel. They learn to be economical, and having a little savings of their own, the Lord makes provision for them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>CONVENTIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">No general convention was held in the United States this year, but there have been 128 local conventions, embracing the English and the foreign-speaking as well as the colored brethren. These conventions have covered practically all of the United States. In most instances, the Society provided the chairman and regional service director for these conventions. The main objective of such conventions has been to encourage each other in the work, pointing out the privileges of service, and then to actively engage in preaching the gospel in the field. Thus the Lord is fulfilling upon his people his promise, to pour out his spirit upon all flesh, meaning all that respond gladly to the call, and this affords the opportunity for all of these to have a part in the proclamation of the message of his kingdom and in the vindication of his name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>SPECIAL SERVICE WEEKS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">During the fiscal year special periods were arranged for a combined effort of the brethren throughout the country to carry the message .of the kingdom to the people. A brief comment on each one of these special service weeks seems appropriate here,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Studies” Campaign, November 15-17</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This met with a ready response on the part of the friends throughout the country, and the Lord blessed their efforts to his glory. The organized classes of the English and foreign-speaking friends and the sharpshooters placed 11,038 sets of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies,</span><span class="font5"> and, in addition, 10,701 other books and 22,306 booklets. In this campaign 6,034 workers participated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Prophecy” Campaign, January 25 to February 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This was a real midwinter campaign and surpassed the expectations of the most optimistic. In this drive 6,240 class workers participated, and during the week they placed 24,260 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy,</span><span class="font5"> and, in addition, 8,540 other books and 30,349 booklets. They worked a total of 30,172 hours, or an average of almost five hours per worker. This demonstrates that winter does not necessarily hinder the work when the anointed appreciate the importance of regularity and consistency in the service, and that the Lord’s kingdom is not a matter of seasons. The kingdom is here for all seasons and the anointed can and will witness to its establishment in winter as well as in summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">IBSA Week, April 28 to May 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The May drive was a real success, from every angle. Despite the fact that the auxiliary colporteurs’ activities have been taken from the classes and shown by themselves, the classes did practically as much this year as they did last year with the auxiliaries included. In this drive 8,378 workers participated, averaging 7.3 hours for a total of 61,471 hours. During this week they placed 43,235 books and 114,129 booklets, or a total of 157,364 pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Starting this drive off with a special radio hook-up did much to make enthusiastic and stimulate the friends, and despite the fact that the hard times were being felt throughout the country, they, by the Lord’s grace, put over one of the most tremendous witnesses ever given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">160,000-Hour Week, July 4 to 13</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The arrangements for this week, and its name, were very evidently directed of the Lord. It was arranged just following a time when the Devil and his cohorts had made a desperate effort to wreck the work in Germany and Central Europe by arranging for his crowd to confiscate the Society’s funds. But instead of that effort’s discouraging the friends or causing them to slack up in their activities, it just put real fight into them and resulted in 8,692 workers’ participating in the drive (the highest number out at any one time during the year). These put in an average of 9.6 hours, or an increase of about 2% hours over the May IBSA Week. During the drive the classes and sharpshooters placed 33,839 bound books and 140,611 booklets, or a total of 174,450 pieces. The bound books placed were not as many as in May, due to the hard times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The title, “150,000-Hour Week,” was much appreciated by many friends who felt that because of conditions they could not be held responsible for the number of books placed, but felt that they were responsible for their time, and they did put in the time; for the classes, sharpshooters and colporteurs exceeded the quota by 4,450 hours.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>REGIONAL SERVICE DIRECTORS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">As</span><span class="font5"> heretofore stated, the Society districted the United States into special territories and assigned to each one a regional service director. These directors visit the classes and help them to organize and to engage actively in the service of preaching the gospel of the kingdom. During the year there have been fourteen English, one colored, one Greek, one Italian, and two Polish regional service directors putting in full time, and seven others putting in part time. The English-speaking brethren served 1,525 classes, and gave instruction to 57,595 workers, and in this work traveled 166,954 miles, all the expenses of which were borne by the Society. The colored regional service directors served 185 classes and instructed 3,494 brethren, and traveled 27,461 miles. The foreignspeaking regional service directors served 487 classes in their respective languages, instructed 9,506 workers, traveled 50,622 miles. All of this work is at the expense of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The results have been very beneficial and encouraging to the brethren, and it shows them their privilege of having a part in the kingdom work. The service workers are now also visiting the smaller classes, or where there are only one or two brethren, otherwise called sharpshooters, to aid them also in the work that they are privileged to do.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>SERVICE DEPARTMENT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Since the Society adopted the policy of placing all languages under one service department in the office, and all working together according to schedule, results have been much more satisfactory. Of course there is no difference between the followers of the Lord, whether they be Englishmen or Greeks, or of other nationalities, but it is necessary for those of the different languages to instruct the people and get the witness work performed amongst those who can speak only their native tongue. During the year these foreign-speaking classes organized for the service visited 286,855 homes and placed in these homes a total of 547,692 pieces of literature.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>THE BETHEL FAMILY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">To be sure, the Bethel family is engaged in the Lord’s service every day, but to have some part in the field as well as in the office has been the desire of the family, and during the year certain periods of time have been set aside and the factory, office and home were closed for certain days. During these days the members of the family went to the field and joyfully engaged in the service. This provided a rich blessing to each and every one, and resulted in giving a splendid witness to the truth. A certain number of the elders in the home visited classes within a radius of 500 miles of New York, and assisted them, while others of the family remained in the vicinity of Brooklyn and, cooperating with the classes in the cosmopolitan</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The colporteurs occupy a very blessed and favorable position in the campaign work. Engaging in this service all their time, not for money and not for joiners, it is their privilege to visit the homes of the people and testify to them concerning the kingdom and to leave with them the books, and other literature, explaining God’s purposes. The Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, being incorporated for the purpose of preaching the gospel and otherwise instructing the people in the Bible, is exempt from taxation. The colporteurs, as well as the class workers, go forth in the field as the representatives of the Society. The books are printed and sent out to these workers, and belong to the Society until disposed of. Consequently these colporteurs and class workers are not peddlers, but are preachers of the gospel representing the Society, and under the Constitution of the United States are entitled to preach the gospel without hindrance or taxation or other burdens. Above all, they represent the Lord, and in obedience to his commandment are doing his work. The result of the colporteur work during the fiscal year is gratifying. From the office manager’s report the following excerpt is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In spite of the severe financial depression throughout the country, the past year 1929-1930 has resulted in more books and booklets being placed in the hands of the people by the colporteurs than ever before. The Lord’s blessing has been upon the colporteurs and their efforts in a remarkable manner. They have entered into the campaign as outlined by the Society with a real joy and enthusiasm. Whenever special service weeks were arranged, the colporteurs have responded with a zeal that has been very encouraging. Even those who have been giving their full time to the Lord’s work have put forth strenuous efforts on these occasions to put m even more than their average number of hours. Consequently the four special service weeks, consisting of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Scripture Studies </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">drive in November, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> week in January, IBSA Week in May, and 150,000-Hour Week in July, resulted in 422,217 pieces of literature being left in the hands of the people within these four weeks by colporteurs only. There has been a greater zeal on the part of those participating in the work, and more have taken advantage of the privileges for engaging in the pioneer and auxiliary service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Enrollment!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">As 1930 draws to a close the records show that 1,259 pioneer colporteurs and 839 auxiliary colporteurs have their names on the active lists. The peak enrollment was reached on July 10, at which time 2,241 had their names on the active list. Throughout the year there was an average of 1,144.08 pioneer colporteurs enrolled and 750.25 auxiliary colporteurs, making </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">total of 1,894.33 colporteurs for the 12-month period. Of these there was an average of 938.11 pioneers who reported regularly each week and 544.70 auxiliaries as compared with 834.10 and 408.63 respectively for 1929.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The particularly encouraging feature of the work done by the colporteurs is the increase in the number of hours averaged by them over and above those reported during the previous year, during which time there was an average of 834.10 pioneer colporteurs who reported 910,356 hours in the actual canvassing, averaging 20.98 hours per week in the service. During the year just past the pioneers reporting weekly averaged 23.44 hours weekly, or totaling 1,143,460 hours in the actual witness work. The auxiliary colporteurs during the previous year averaged 408.63 reporting weekly, and these put in an average of 8.45 hours per week, as compared with the average of 10.40 hours per week given by the 544.70 auxiliaries during 1930.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The hard times, however, have noticeably affected the number of obtainers per hour, which for the pioneer colporteurs has declined from 1.05 during 1929 to .82 for 1930. An even greater decline is noticed among the auxiliary colporteurs, who averaged 1.23 during 1929 and only .83 during 1930. This has resulted in a decrease in the average pioneer colporteur margin per hour, which has declined from $.46 for</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1929 to $.319 for 1930, resulting in the average margin per year being only $389.07 as compared with $501.24 during the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Books and Booklets Distributed!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(a) Literature</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The increased number of colporteurs reporting weekly and the increased number of hours in the service have resulted in more literature being left in the hands of the people. The pioneers distributed 1,194,356 clothbound books, 1,130,372 10-cent booklets, and 148,962 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> or a total of 2,473,690 pieces of literature. This represents an increase of 40,074 pieces of literature over that placed during the previous year, in spite of the fact that during 1929 there was a campaign with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> booklet which resulted in 392,522 of these booklets alone being placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The auxiliaries have also shown a very good increase in the work which they have accomplished, placing 194,714 clothbound books, 292,368 ten-cent booklets, and 48,287 five-cent booklets. The combined results show that for pioneers and auxiliaries 1,389,070 bound books, 1,422,740 ten-cent and 197,249 five-cent booklets were placed, which gives a grand total of 3,009,059 pieces of literature for 1930.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">When these figures are compared with the work done by the colporteurs in 1925, at which time </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">total of only 295,258 clothbound books were placed during the entire year by pioneers and auxiliaries, one can surely marvel at the way the Lord is fulfilling his promise to increase the kingdom interests committed to his servants.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(b) People Served</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Literature has been left in the hands of 1,186,704 different people, of which number 941,704 obtained their books from pioneer colporteurs and 245,000 obtained them from auxiliaries. Of this number, 645,478 persons took one or more clothbound books. The pioneers placed book combinations in the homes of 196,790 people, and the auxiliaries in 24,947. Single books were left in 343,632 homes by the pioneers, and in 80,109 homes by the auxiliaries. This represents an average </span><span class="font4">of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">578.33 persons served per pioneer colporteur and 197.28 for each auxiliary who reported weekly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Territory:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During the past year there has been an increase in the number of counties which have been released by the classes for the pioneer work, so that instead of only 2,300.30, 2,533.5 were open. Of this number, pioneers were assigned to 1,997.5, and in the counties held by classes, totaling 533.5, colporteurs assisted in 382.5. This leaves only 536 pioneer counties which were not assigned to colporteurs during 1930.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is encouraging to see how thoroughly some of the states have been canvassed by either classes or colporteurs, such states as Connecticut, Delaware and New Jersey being of those which have had someone in each of the counties in the state. California, Louisiana and Maine had only one pioneer county which was not assigned; while Arizona, Maryland and Massachusetts had only 3. The state of Texas, which has 254 counties, received a great witness during the past year, as colporteurs have worked 198.5 of the 221 which are available for pioneer work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Besides territory within the United States itself, for a month and a half last fall there was a pioneer colporteur in Alaska, finishing up the work he was doing during the previous year. During this time he placed a total of 383 books and 293 booklets. There has been a pioneer colporteur in the Canal Zone, who has been working every week. He has placed 3,333 clothbound books, and 1,186 five-cent and ten-cent booklets. Colombia, South America, has had 3 auxiliary colporteurs, who have been handicapped in their work because of the difficulty in getting their literature through the customs offices. They have, however, placed 33 books and'34 booklets, besides distributing some free tracts. In Costa Rica there are at the present time two pioneers and four auxiliaries on the active lists. Another pioneer was enrolled during the year, but has now dropped off. These colporteurs placed a total of 812 books and 265 five-cent and ten-cent booklets in the hands of 751 persons. Cuba has had two pioneer colporteurs during the past year, but only one is now on the active list These left</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">780 books and 867 booklets in the hands of 1,193 persons. Dutch Guiana has had one pioneer and one auxiliary. These have placed 60 books and 934 booklets in the hands of 435 people. For a while last winter one pioneer spent several months in the island of Haiti, during which time she placed 38 books and 103 booklets in the hands of 100 people. At the present time there is a pioneer colporteur working in Honduras. During the 33 weeks that she has been there she has left 1,746 books and 838 booklets in the hands of 1,816 persons. Before the opening of the Mexican branch there were three pioneer colporteurs in that country reporting to this office, who placed 628 books and 1,549 booklets in the hands of 859 persons. Panama has one pioneer colporteur and one auxiliary colporteur. These have placed 533 books and 365 booklets in the hands of 674 people. There has been one auxiliary colporteur Working in the Philippines, who has placed 166 books and 214 booklets in the hands of 157 persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Colored and Foreign Colporteurs In the United States:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The report this year shows a remarkable increase in the work done by the colored and foreign colporteurs in the United States and other territory under the direction of this office. During the year there have been 165 colored colporteurs who have reported, and there are now 127 on the active list; of which number, 54 are pioneers and 73 are auxiliaries. These have placed a total of 107,909 pieces of literature and have canvassed 82,495 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Reports have been received from colporteurs of twentyeight different nationalities, which are as follows: Armenian, 4 pioneers, 4 auxiliaries; Austrian, 3 auxiliaries; Bulgarian, 1 auxiliary; Danish, 2 pioneers, 2 auxiliaries; Philippine, 1 auxiliary; Finnish, 5 pioneers, 1 auxiliary; French, 2 pioneers, 4 auxiliaries; German, 10 pioneers of which 7 are now active, 14 auxiliaries; Greek, 23 pioneers, 12 auxiliaries, of which 17 and 9 respectively are active; Hollandish, 3 auxiliaries; Hungarian, 1 pioneer, 1 auxiliary; Italian, 7 pioneers, 2 auxiliaries; Jewish, 2 pioneers, 1 auxiliary; Lettish, 1 pioneer; Lithuanian, 1 pioneer; Norwegian, 4 pioneers, 10 auxiliaries; Polish, 18 pioneers, 8 auxiliaries; Rumanian, I auxiliary; Russian, 1 pioneer; Serbian, 1 pioneer; Slovak, 3 auxiliaries; Slovenian, 1 pioneer; Spanish, 2 pioneers, 8 auxiliaries, of which 1 and 7 respectively are on the active list; Swedish, 8 pioneers, 4 auxiliaries; Swiss, 1 pioneer, 2 auxiliaries; Syrian, 1 pioneer; Ukrainian, 1 pioneer; 1 Mexican auxiliary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">With this field force to work amongst the foreign-speaking population of this country, a great witness has been left in the homes of all nationalities.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>KINGDOM WORK PROGRESSES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It is not only interesting but brings joy to the heart of the remnant to note the steadily-increasing amount of work done in the interests of the kingdom. The fiscal year of 1922 really marked the beginning of the organisation for field work. That year there was a monthly average of 269.50 colporteurs in the field. The fiscal year of 1930 shows a monthly average of 1,144.8 colporteurs in the field. Some months there are more; some, less. The peak was reached in September, when there were 1,320 colporteurs actively engaged. These are designated the “pioneers”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the pioneer colporteurs, during the year 1930 there have been engaged in the auxiliary colporteur service an average of 750.25 a month. The highest number engaged in any one month was 933.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The average number enrolled for 1922, regular and auxiliary colporteur service, was 463. The average number of regular and auxiliary colporteurs for 1930 was 1,894 colporteurs in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These traveling messengers of peace, representing God’s kingdom of peace and righteousness, are doing more than any other class of people under the sun to stabilize the minds of the people and help them to bear their burdens now, and to see what God has for them in the future. Their work bears testimony to the glory of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society, without boasting, realizes the responsibility of giving the testimony concerning God’s kingdom. The Lord has commanded that this testimony must be given, and those who love him will have a part in giving it. The Society, as hereinbefore defined, being his anointed people, then must and will joyfully respond to this commandment and see that the testimony is given. Such has been the real reason for the effort to thoroughly organize the entire territory, and to keep regular reports concerning the work in order to determine what people have been reached and what have not. There has never before been such an educational campaign carried on on earth by any organization. That this educational campaign might be conducted in an orderly and effective way to the glory of God, it is directed from the main office, so far as the visible organization is concerned. To be sure, the Lord is depended upon for the direction of the entire matter. Some have had difficulty in understanding ^hy the organization and its work should be directed from one office. But certainly this is the Lord’s way, in order that the entire organization may work in exact harmony. For this reason the Brooklyn headquarters appoints the service director for each class and outlines the course that shall be followed. It appoints and sends out field regional service men, and these all endeavor to work in exact harmony. The brethren in the organization appreciate the necessity of working together in harmonious order. The Lord has manifested his approval by putting his blessing upon the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is further seen that it is necessary first to prepare the literature in proper form to publish it, and manufacture it into book and booklet form, to announce it by radio, and then to personally call upon the people and tell them about God’s kingdom. Never before was there such a blessed, happy work engaged in by creatures on earth. The result for the year will be encouraging to all who have engaged in it, and this without regard to the persecutions and hardships suffered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In former years it was the custom of the president of the Society to visit the classes throughout the country once a year, and to have many meetings and conventions. It has been found, however, to be physically impossible to do this and at the same time do the work that seems to be properly applied to the executive office. This personal contact with the brethren is very much missed; but when we realize that the Lord has assigned each one his position and each one has his particular wheel to turn in the organization, then we may forget personal contact, and push on with the work with our might, wherever we may be situated. The brethren are learning that each one of us is responsible to the Lord, and are therefore diligently striving to do whatsoever they do as unto the Lord, and to his glory.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>COLORED BRANCH</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Because of the race prejudice existing amongst the peoples of the world, it was deemed best to specially organize the work amongst our colored brethren. The Lord, of course, makes no distinction as to a man’s color. He judges him not according to his outward appearance, but by his heart devotion. This separate organization amongst the colored brethren, however, has proved a decided success and has had the blessing of the Lord. It has afforded better opportunities for the brethren of the African race residing in the United States to engage in the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are at this time 57 colored classes organized in the United States and doing the work. There is a total number of 528 active workers in the field, but some of them cannot give as much time as others. During the year these have placed in the hands of the people clothbound books to the number of 32,592, and booklets to the number of 35,445, making a total of 68,037.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It must be borne in mind that almost all of these brethren are poor and they must work a goodly portion of the time at some secular employment in order to earn their food and raiment. The class workers, however, have averaged </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3½</span><span class="font5"> hours in the field per week in preaching the gospel. Not only have these class workers been well organized, but during the year 165 of them participated in the colporteur work. Of these, 75 are pioneers and 90 auxiliary colporteurs. These colporteurs had the privilege of placing in the hands of the people a large amount of literature. They visited interested people in 53,365 homes. There they put 57,510 clothbound books and 50,399 booklets, making a total of 107,909 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work done by the colored class workers and colporteurs combined is 175,946 books and booklets. The following is an itemized report of the work done by the colored friends:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Classes organized for service &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In addition to this the colored brethren have used the radio from time to time, and thus reached the people to whom they might not otherwise have had a chance to give the testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The result of the work amongst the colored brethren for the year is gratifying, and those engaged in it have rejoiced much, and it is hoped that this will encourage others to see their privilege of participating in giving the testimony concerning the kingdom and thus singing forth the praises of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>BLIND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society has been diligently putting forth an effort during the year to serve the blind brethren. This work is necessarily limited, because of the great handicap in preparing the literature for the blind. However, during the year considerable work has been done for the blind people in the United States, Australia, South Africa, England and Canada. Many interesting letters have been received, and a keen interest has been manifest by some who have had their mental vision illuminated. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font5"> texts have been prepared for these blind people; also </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Watch Tower,</span><span class="font5"> and other literature, has been placed in their hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The interested have increased in numbers during the year. Although this work is small compared with the other parts of the work, yet the Society has much joy in being able to put the message of the truth in the hands of some who cannot see with their natural eyes. It is suggested that everywhere the brethren knowing of persons who are blind and who would likely be interested, interview them, and if interested, send their name and address to the Society’s branch for the blind, at 1210 Spear Street, Logansport, Ind.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>OTHER LANGUAGES</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">The population of the United States is cosmopolitan, as is well known. There are some people speaking practically all the languages residing within its borders. Most of the people, however, even those foreign-born, speak the English language, and the witness is given to them in the English when given at all. There are others, however, who are unable to speak the English language, and the Society is putting forth a strenuous effort to serve such with the message of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The service work has been organized for the benefit of those speaking other than the English language. These classes have been organized, and there have been colporteurs in the field as well as class workers. Bulletins have been published in these foreign tongues, and sent to the respective classes. The classes organized in the United States outside of the Englishspeaking classes represent fifteen different languages. Amongst these are 943 class workers. Of the number of foreign-speaking brethren in the United States who are interested in the truth, there should be more engaged in this part of the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the past year the service amongst these brethren has been more systematically organized, and directed under the service department at the Adams Street office, and this has shown splendid results. The work accomplished by the field workers in these classes during the year is as follows, to wit: Clothbound books placed in the hands of the people, 105,065; booklets 374,590; making a total of 479,655 books and booklets in languages other than English in the homes of the people during the year. The average number of hours devoted to the service during the year has been 3.6, and literature has been placed in that time in 244,837 homes. Thus many persons have had the opportunity to receive consolation from the Lord, and to know that his kingdom is at hand and soon his blessing will be upon those who obey him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society has printed and manufactured the books in these various languages at the Brooklyn office, and in addition to what has been placed in the United States, there have been shipped to the various branch offices the following: bound books, 204,793; booklets, 519,855; also 918 Bibles were distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Brethren speaking these various languages reside in the Bethel home and devote their time to the work either in the home or in the office especially with relation to the preaching of the gospel in their respective languages. Thus the Society affords an opportunity to persons coming to the United States from their countries to gain a knowledge of the truth concerning God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hereto is appended a brief recapitulation of the literature placed in the hands of the people of the various languages in the United States, to wit:</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark308"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark309"></a>FINANCES</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">It would be utterly impossible for any human organization carried on according to human methods to accomplish the same amount of work within the year as the Society has in the fiscal year closed, with the small amount of money employed. If this work were done for pecuniary profit the result would be entirely different. Because it is prompted wholly by love for the Lord, he puts his blessing upon it. He puts his spirit upon the brethren who do the work, and thus qualifies them to do work that otherwise would be impossible. The preparation of the literature, the operation of the machines, the organization of the work, being done by those wholly devoted to the Lord, it is certain that the Lord directs it and puts his blessing upon it. This explains why such a tremendous amount of work can be done by so small a number of persons, and with so little money. To be sure, the work could not be carried on for the amount of money received for the disposition of literature. The deficiency is made up by contributions from the brethren in various parts of the country, who are really devoted to the Lord and who are anxious to have their money used to the Lord’s glory. The contributors are not able to send much, but every penny counts, and by the Lord’s grace it is put to a good use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As in former years, the Lord has blessed the work here and permitted the expenses in America to be met and yet a considerable sum of money to be sent to foreign countries. Satan made a desperate attempt to wreck the work entirely in Germany by causing the failure of a bank in which the principal amount of the funds for Germany and Central Europe was deposited. The effort of the enemy, however, failed. The facts being called to the attention of the brethren, they responded with a renewed effort, and at a personal sacrifice quickly made up that which was lost, and the work moves grandly on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It must be manifest to all engaged in this work that only the spirit of the Lord could accomplish such results. Brethren in different walks of life, and of different languages and habits, come together and in one spirit work harmoniously, and by the Lord’s grace accomplish results. Notwithstanding the depressed conditions amongst the people, the great amount of unemployment and suffering, those who are really devoted to the Lord have been able by personal sacrifice to contribute money to carry on the work; and this is one of the strong evidences that the Lord places his approval upon it. It could not be otherwise. This is a campaign in the interests of the Lord’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is the greatest campaign in which creatures were ever engaged on earth, and when the Lord says to his people, “I am with you,” then each one may be fully assured that he will provide all the means necessary for carrying on that campaign to a successful conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Reports to this office show that the brethren throughout the land are enthusiastic, as many of them say, “thrilled,” and impelled to put forth a greater zeal than ever to give the testimony that God has committed to them through Christ Jesus,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fiscal year has been one of some suffering, some trials and tribulations, but above all these has been the blessing of the Lord that has brought a real joy and patience to those who have engaged in the work. All honor and praise is given to the name of the great Jehovah God for his blessings. The anointed are more determined than ever to press the battle at the gate, and continue to sing forth the honor of his name.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark310"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark311"></a>FOREIGN LANDS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">And now we invite the attention of those interested in the kingdom to the report from foreign lands. The same spirit and zeal for the Lord prompts our brethren in those countries to bear the fruits of the kingdom to the people in their respective lands.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark312"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark313"></a>SOUTH AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">When one views the map of South Africa he sees it is a vast territory. Learning that the population is scattered and the workers few, we can have some small conception of the efforts necessary to be put forth in order to give a witness in that land. It is gratifying to report that the work in South Africa is organized and the campaign progressing to the glory of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren are zealous, earnest and wholly devoted to the cause of our righteous </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">King. I could do no better than to quote from the report of our beloved and zealous local manager at Cape Town, and this is done as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lord’s witnesses in this land have enjoyed the privilege of service during the past twelve months. The vivid “lightning” flashes from the temple have brought great joy to our hearts, and, with a clear vision of the Lord’s purpose, we have sought to do his bidding in his appointed way. In so doing, we have been conscious of his approval The fact that the enemy has again made strenuous effort to make trouble and discourage the workers is a testimony to the fidelity of those giving the witness. His efforts always end in failure; for opposition instigated by him or his dupes only serves to unite more firmly the faithful anointed and acts as a spur to greater activity. We are grateful for the ‘secret place’ and for the Lord’s protecting care through the ministry of the angels in Zion. We are few in number, but strong in the strength which he supplies, and an extensive witness has again been given throughout the country. His blessing has rested upon the effort, as the following summary shows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The figures are lower than they were during the last two preceding years. This is due to the fact that we did not have a five-cent booklet for special distribution. In 1928 and 1929 a postal campaign was conducted by the friends throughout the country to give a witness to some of those Who could not be reached by the door-to-door effort, and many thousands of the five-cent booklets were distributed in that way. While we have not had a five-cent booklet this year, those in the lonely places of this great land have not been overlooked. The Lord put it into the heart of a brother in the Cape Town ecclesia to buy up and pay postage on approximately 50,000 of the older ten-cent booklets. Farmers, living miles off the beaten track, staffs of lighthouses round the coast, rangers dwelling in the heart of forests far removed from civilization have had the message of the kingdom brought to them in this way. The wrapping and addressing was done by members of the Cape Town ecclesia. Many orders for the full set and other publications have been received as a result, while accompanying letters gave clear indication that the good news of the kingdom had brought comfort, joy and hope to many who could not be reached in any other way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SERVICE WORK: The regular door-to-door effort has been well maintained throughout the year. The European population, amongst whom the bulk of the work is done, numbers rather less than one and three-quarters millions. At the end of last year some thought that saturation point had been reached when, after six years’ effort, half a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">million books and booklets had gone out. The figures for the year just ended prove such conclusion to be entirely wrong. As all the workable population has more or less been reached, the majority on more than one occasion, individual workers no longer reach the high figures obtained formerly, but our records show that the brethren generally are becoming more experienced and the percentage of bound volumes placed continues to show improvement. During the year just ended the bound volumes placed in the door-to-door work are in excess of booklets to the extent of 10,000. This is very gratifying; for it shows that not only are the workers becoming more efficient, but as many of these books are finding their way into the hands of those who previously received booklets, interest in the message of the kingdom can definitely be said to be on the increase. We have not had so much poverty and distress in this land as has been the case in Europe and America, and consequently many, while sympathetic towards the message, are still too apathetic to take a definite stand. Then again, climatic conditions tend to make people less mentally alert than in colder climes, and a considerable number do no reading at all It will take Armageddon to wake the most of them up. In the meantime, and in spite of the drawbacks, the Lord’s witnesses continue to conduct a strenuous campaign, piling up a testimony for the Lord and against Satan and his organization which will never be forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The colporteurs have again done splendid work. One has to experience the conditions in the field in this land to appreciate them. In spite of the trying conditions, however, one seldom hears a complaint, and these dear brethren have pursued their work with diligence. They have been greatly blessed in bringing forth the fruits of the kingdom. There has been a weekly average of 10. Calls numbered 40,316, and they placed 25,832 books and booklets, 70 percent of which were bound volumes. With the exception of Namaqualand, a sparsely populated strip of land on the extreme west of Cape Province, all of the territory had previously been worked. There has been a weekly average of five auxiliaries. These brethren have made 7,296 calls, and placed 3,750 books and booklets, of which 64 percent were bound volumes. The average number of class workers reporting per week has been 47. During the year they made 48,745 calls, or 20 calls a week per worker, and the persons receiving literature numbered 21,843, of which 42 percent received bound volumes. There has been an average of 17 centers reporting regularly, while we hear from as many more on occasion. Two new ecclesias have recently been formed and organized for service. A considerable number of the brethren in this land live on farms and in comparative isolation, with little or no territory in their immediate vicinity. Accordingly they do not find it possible to make regular effort as do brethren in the towns. On special occasions, such as IBSA weeks, practically all do make an effort, sometimes with much inconvenience and at considerable cost to themselves, to get somewhere where they may give the witness to others. Upward of 100 brethren took part in both the IBSA week in May and during the recent “Time” week, and some 7,246 books and booklets were placed. Our quota for the latter was 1,500 hours, and when all the reports came in, we found that We were not far off our objective. With some 12 more brethren in the field and 500 more books placed than in the IBSA week in May, it was probably the greatest concerted effort yet put forth in South Africa. The oldest brother in the field (66 years of age) put in the most hours, his total being 62. Great joy was experienced by all having a Share, and we here were glad to join with the anointed remnant everywhere in making reply to the Devil’s attack on the kingdom interests in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REGIONAL DIRECTORS AND PUBLIC WITNESS: Visits from regional directors have been productive of much good. Their timely exhortations, and more particularly their personal example in getting out with the friends in the work, have been a stimulus to the workers in the centers visited. The friends throughout the country are realising more fully than ever before the great need for organized effort and unity of action. As the purpose of our calling becomes more clear, we confidently anticipate Still closer cooperation in the future. We should like to see all on the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> file making application for such visits. Public meetings have been few in number, and these have been chiefly in the Country districts, as an introduction to the colporteur effort. In all, 49 lectures were given, 25,229 handbills were distributed to advertise same, and 2,889 persons attended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SERVICE CONVENTIONS: Service conventions have been held in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban. One cannot help noting and commenting upon the difference between these gatherings and the old style of convention. At the latter we used to come together for a more or less selfish purpose. Now we have a people, it may be few in number, but with the set purpose of honoring the name of Jehovah and with a keen appreciation of their responsibility to give the witness. At the same tune our vision is burnished and we obtain renewed strength and courage to continue with the good work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW PUBLICATIONS: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> were received early in the year, and more recently we have received supplies of two new booklets. They are having a good circulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">With your permission </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Judgment</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> have been translated into Afrikaans. We are confident these will be useful adjuncts to the books already in that language and be used of the Lord to give a more extensive witness in the Afrikaansspeaking centers. We now look forward with keen anticipation to receiving </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and hope it will be here in time for our “Testimonies” campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE WATCH TOWER and THE GOLDEN AGE: There is practically no change on </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">files, so far as numbers go. Some lose the vision and drop off; others come along to take their place. Letters received numbered 3,279, and 4,250 were sent out. There were also some thousands of circular letters dispatched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The ranks of the full-time workers have recently been increased by the arrival of two brethren from Britain. We thank you for sending them. They are happy to be here, and we are happy to have our little band strengthened by their presence and example of devotion. We hope by the Lord’s grace to have a still better report to render next year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Announcement has just been made that a regular weekly air service will be commenced early 1931 between Cape Town and Europe. Our hope of a visit from you gets brighter each year. Even a 'flying’ visit would give a great impetus to the work here if you could possibly spare the time. In the meantime, you may rest assured there is a remnant here who have not bowed the knee to Baal and who are wholly on the Lord’s siue and who go forward into the new year with greater determination than ever to be true and faithful witnesses. Those who love the Lord supremely are standing "  shoulder to shoulder” and will continue to lift up the voice together until the work is done. We send you our love and assure you. of our loyal cooperation.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark314"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark315"></a>WEST AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The people of West Africa continue to have a vigorous witness to the truth. The brethren there are few in number, but zealous. All the churches have combined and employed the agency of the press to attack the truth, and have been doing so vigorously. The local manager reports:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">This activity of the enemy has but afforded a wider publicity to the truth. The little band has been pressing the battle to the gate as hard as ever. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">It</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> is only now that the opponents begin to realize that it is not easy to kick against the pricks, and find the greater the attack, the more they stultify themselves to the common people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year 30 public meetings were held, with a total attendance of 9,940; 240 class meetings, with an attendance of 3,500; letters received 520, sent out 460; books and booklets distributed as follows :</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">With this please find report for the year 1929-1930. We have done all that was possible within our means to glorify the name of our Father and have had fairly good success, considering that we could go nine thousand better than last year. We thank our gracious Father for it all. A few went out, but with a few less we did better .</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It seems that some people think that the Lord calls them only to sit at ease. We will try to do better for this coming year, although the clouds are quite dark just now, for we are just under a revolutionary government. Everybody expects this new regime to be better than the one that was overthrown yesterday, but in fact nothing can be said. One thing we know for sure: that it is the last time for the kings of this world and our King will be victorious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The whole class unite in giving you their thankful appreciation for all the help given to us during the past year, and hope the Lord will keep his blessings upon you and therefore upon us alL</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark367"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark368"></a>AUSTRALIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Australia, with its vast territory, has a comparatively small number of witnesses for the Lord, but these are zealous and earnest and are doing good work. It was deemed to the interests of the work to change the management during the year. About February Brother MacGillivray was sent from America to take charge of the office and the work in Australia, and New Zealand and the South Sea Islands. Because of the great distance between that point and the Brooklyn office, it is necessary to close the books early in order to get the report in. The report therefore embraces only eleven months. It shows a healthy increase of the work. From the local manager’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I have much pleasure in sending the report for the year 1929-30. The year has been one of continuous activity by the Lord’s anointed. Much opposition, of course, has been met with from the Devil and his cohorts, and many difficulties have to be overcome in a land such as this, where the people are scattered over such a wide area; nevertheless the Lord’s witnesses sallied forth and endeavored to place the message of the kingdom in the hands of the people, and the figures prove that the Lord’s blessing has been upon them in a special sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Our records show that no less than 950,000 calls have been made at the people’s homes. While this does not mean that every home has been reached, nevertheless the greater number have had the witness given to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During the year, or rather during eleven months, because we have had to end the year earlier in order to have the report sent in to Brooklyn in time, a total of 185,632 pieces of literature was placed in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEER SERVICE: Sixty-seven pioneers are in the field at the close of the year. These brethren put in an average of 24.3 hours per week, placing on an average 27 books and 20 booklets. The greatest number of books was therefore placed by the pioneers. Some of these have great difficulties to overcome. In many places in the country sections the houses are a hundred miles apart; this particular part of the territory is usually reached by means of colporteur vans, and during the year six of such were in use, with two pioneers on each van, and much good was accomplished in carrying the truth to those in the back blocks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is very encouraging to see the great number of brethren, young and old, joining the ranks of the Lord’s army and forsaking the Devil’s organization. This has been particularly true in Australia and New Zealand during the latter part of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SERVICE WORK: Practically all the classes are organized for service, and much good work has been done by them in their local territories during the year. It is found that where the work is carried on in harmony with that which is done at headquarters in Brooklyn, greater success is had in placing the literature. Some are inclined to call this Americanizing the work, but we do not think that is correct. It is the Lord’s way of doing things; whether it originates in America makes no difference as long as we are assured the Lord is behind it. Therefore the reorganization of the work in Australia in the latter part of the year resulted in a tremendous increase in the output of literature, so much so that many of the brethren are surprised at the results themselves. It is the Lord’s doing, end we are glad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The year 1929-1930 saw 30 classes in Australia and 15 in New Zealand organized for service. Although some of these places had only three to five in attendance, the witness work performed by them throughout the year was very creditable indeed. Commencing the year 1930-1931 the smaller classes have been reorganized under the sharpshooter work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">An analysis </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> the work for the year throughout Australia shows an average of 273 class workers in the field each week, and that a total of 67,930 pieces of literature was placed in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In New Zealand the average number of class workers in the field each week was 59. It is due to their labors that 18,293 pieces of literature were placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REGIONAL DIRECTORS’ SERVICE: There are no more &quot;pilgrims” in existence on this continent, but during the year three brethren participated in regional service work, visiting the classes, encouraging them to engage in the service and showing them the way to do it. The friends are happy because of these visits and the fact that they are enabled to see how they can glorify the Lord by telling the people the message of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During the year the regional service directors traveled 42,453 miles, and held seven public meetings and 57 parlor meetings. The total attendance at these meetings was 1,465 adults. These brethren confine themselves to the things that are written in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> rather than speculating on matter that is not yet revealed to the church. In this way they prove a considerable help to the friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVENTIONS: During the year one general convention was held at Melbourne, where a large gathering of workers assembled. The majority of these were from the local state. Encouraging discourses were given on the current issues of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and the brethren participated in field service work, and everybody attending the convention felt happy because of being privileged to be present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In addition to this, thirteen local conventions were held during the year, these designated aS &quot;service conventions” and specially arranged for that purpose. The friends attending these enjoyed the service and felt glad because of the time in which we are living and God’s revelation to his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">One of the conventions held in New Zealand was arranged specifically for the Maori people. This race is taking a keen interest in the truth, and many classes are springing up amongst them. It is indeed encouraging to see this race, who have been so much downtrodden and oppressed by churchianity, taking an active part in the proclamation of the message of the kingdom. Several of them are now busily engaged in the translation of the books so that they can be passed on to their people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RADIO: During the latter part of the year the services of five radio stations located in different parts of Australia were secured for broadcasting the message of the kingdom. Much good has been accomplished by these broadcasts, and the way opened up for the pioneers and others to get the htera-ture into the homes. The enemy has made one or two attempts to stop the preaching of the gospel over the radio, but up to the present time we are still allowed to continue the good work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ISLANDS: The islands surrounding Australia, such as Fiji, have not had a witness given to them during this year, owing to the fact that no brethren were available for that purpose, but it is hoped that with the beginning of the new year brethren will be found who can go and give the witness to these people. There is much good work to be done on these islands, a considerable number of which are under the jurisdiction of Satan’s false religions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FOREIGN-SPEAKING: During the year an effort was made to reach the foreign-speaking people and this has met with considerable success. These people from different parts of Europe appreciate the truth and in many cases rejoice to be free from the yoke of false churchianity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">During the year it was thought best, in the interests of the work, to move the office from Rio de Janeiro to Sao Paulo, because of the more cosmopolitan population and greater interest in the truth. The work there is increasing, notwithstanding many handicaps. Concerning the moving of the office, the local manager reports:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">April was the month for the moving of the branch from Rio de Janeiro to Sao Paulo city. The brethren in Sao Paulo were very interested in the moving. We studied the matter, and Brother Chapman and I presented you the idea. You were favorable, but asked for more information. More information was sent to you; and you gave order and money to move, and the moving was done. Now we are in Sao Paulo city, according to the new address. In May the moving was in Sao Paulo into a house. It is past five months, but the blessings of the Lord are upon the branch here, as the output of literature indicates. From October to March the output of books and booklets was 4,497 in Rio de Janeiro, and 7,029 in Sao Paulo city from May to September: six months in Rio de Janeiro and five months in Sao Paulo city. The increase is apparent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Sao Paulo city is the proper place for the center of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord’s work in Brazil There are here many peoples speaking different tongues. Our need actually is to have colporteurs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The local manager has visited many places, and held many meetings during the year, in view of the other duties he has had to perform, and the work is taking on a new impetus in that land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Further quotation from the local manager is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We have actually seven classes with regular meetings with an attendance from 10 to 20 persons; more or less. In these classes some brethren and sisters -are going out with the literature, preaching the gospel to the people. In my visits to the classes I direct the work as well as possible. In Curityba all anointed ones are German. There I was as a director of service; in other cities where there is no class, I, with the literature, was as a pioneer colporteur, otherwise manager, and always thanking the Lord for his love and mercy in directing me in his blessed service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I traveled 5,616 kilometers, and visited 27 cities. I held 53 lectures, with an attendance of 9,860 persons. I received 308 letters, and dispatched 349. There were 3,033 packages of literature dispatched. The partakers of Memorial were 106. Fifteen brethren symbolized their consecration to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">There were printed 2,290 copies of the Brazilian </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watch Tower,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and there were printed also 5,800 copies of Portuguese translation of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">World Distress.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> There were dispatched during the fiscal year 11,526 books and booklets in different languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The different nationalities that are interested in the truth in that land are indicated by the fact that books were placed in the following languages: English, Arabic, Armenian, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Lettish, Lithuanian, Polish, Portuguese, Rumanian, Russian, Spanish, Ukrainian and Yiddish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By this distribution you may see how the strangers are coming to live in our great Brazil, whose future in the Lord’s work will be simply marvelous. My great desire and prayer is to work, doing my best, unto the end, honoring and glorifying the great Jehovah God and his anointed One and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">g, Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark370"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark371"></a>BRITAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">At London, England, is the headquarters for the British work of the Society. The territory embraced is England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. The numbers devoted to the Lord are small compared with the population, but they are great in the strength of the Lord. The efforts put forth by them this year have resulted in a personal visit to a majority of the homes in that part of the territory. A greater number of bound books have been placed this year than the previous year. The grand total is less, due to the cheaper booklet, as mentioned in other parts of this report. Taken as a whole there is a healthy increase of the work in Britain, and the result brings joy to the heart of everyone who is devoted to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The local manager’s report so well covers the ground that the following excerpt is here inserted, and that with real pleasure:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I again have pleasure in sending to you the annual report of the Lord’s work done in the British part of the field. The report is, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> course, for the twelve months ending September 30. I count it a great privilege to send this to you as Jehovah’s representative in this great work now being done in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The report shows that the total number of books and booklets sent out from the London depot in the year is 1,217,166. Of this number, 639,592 were bound volumes, and 677,574 were booklets. The total is a somewhat lesser number than that of last year. The lessened number is in the output of the booklets, and this is owing to the fact that this year there has not been a cheap booklet as was the case during the two previous years. The output of the regular books and booklets issued from time to time has been considerably increased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">But if there is a lessened output of booklets to report, there is on the other hand a gratifying increase in the number of bound books: there is an advance on last year of 136,513. In the work of putting these into the hands of the people 5,288,656 calls have been made at their homes. This in turn means that the witness of the truth as to the establishment of the kingdom of God has been given in the majority of the homes of the people in these countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SERVICE WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">As in previous years the service work is our best means of getting the books in the hands and into the homes of the people. This part of the work has placed 320,861 bound books, and 457,369 booklets, a total of 778,230, and in doing so has registered 3,483,260 calls on the people. It is only since December last that the number of hours spent in this service has been on record. Since then 369,944 hours of service have been recorded which, on average, would give 490,000 hours for the year. These figures undoubtedly represent the devoted work of loyal and faithful hearts, and a set purpose to serve to the fullest possible extent the interests of our great and gracious God Jehovah, who has revealed himself to his people, and to whom he has given the highest present honor of being his witness before all men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">But it is in this phase of the work that there is yet the greatest possibility of increase. Again it has to be reported that a number of the smaller classes do not accept their privilege of organizing themselves for service, and this of course means that they do not take up their responsibility therein. There can be no question of the loss which this entails: to themselves. Whatever ideal may he held, the plain facts are that organization produces better results than individual efforts not directed by another for the general interests, no matter how good-intentioned individual efforts may be. But besides the fact that there are still some classes which have not accepted the way surely opened up by the Lord, the chief Reaper himself, there are many who would claim to be more than merely interested in the purposes of God who do not enter into their privilege and responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The number of permit holders, that is, of those who carry the IBSA permit issued to cover them from police interference as they go from door to door, is much less than the readers of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> If it should be my privilege next year to report the number of workers, I hope it will be considerably increased, and that I may also have the pleasure of telling you that all the British classes are in line in this very important phase of the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Sunday service still proves to be most productive. The Sunday mor</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">nin</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">g hour is now the time when the gospel of the kingdom is widely proclaimed. It is ideal: the morning of ease after a strenuous week finds the possible reader in the mood most likely to take a book where he can learn something or, as he may think, find something to interest him for a little time; but it is also a rest of mind and spirit for the preacher of the gospel as he seeks thus to honor his God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Bethel family continue to enjoy their privilege in the service work. The number of calls made during the year is 22,599, and the books and booklets placed in the homes, 6,886. The family are very appreciative of the privilege of having all Saturdays free for this service. May I say in passing that they are the most successful of all in getting the people to take the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">COLPORTEUR SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">This service, so greatly honored by the Lord from its beginning, has again done a good work. The total of books and booklets placed by the colporteurs during the year is 458,616, of which 191,233 were bound volumes and 267,383 were booklets. This year rather more attention was given to placing the volumes, with the result that there was an increase on last year of 17,071. In doing their work the colporteurs made 1,804,390 calls and put 259,046 hours into their service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The special canvass of the business centers of the larger towns and cities has again been a productive work. This work offers the greatest opportunities for colporteurs who have some experience in the business parts of the cities or who have the zeal to undertake any possible work for the Lord. The work has demonstrated that it is not business ability that succeeds best in this canvass, but zeal for the Lord properly manifested brings its reward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">While all those who seek to serve Jehovah under the Lord’s direction have the blessings of heaven upon them, surely the Father himself, as well as the Lord, looks with pleasure upon those who give all their time to go into the field to tell the gospel of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The average number of colporteurs is slightly less than last year, but as a body they have responded to their privilege, and the number of calls made is considerably increased on last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The auxiliary colporteurs have also done well. Their average number is increased from 70 to 102, but they have worked more hours, and have increased their calls from 182,836 to 347,088; that is, with 50 percent added to the number nearly 100 percent has been gained in the number of calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">REGIONAL DIRECTOR SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The number of brethren engaged in this service is seven, the same as last year. These have surely been a means of stimulus and refreshment to the classes visited. The number of visits is 1,084, and at each class they have shared with the local brethren on their drives. More than twice as many brethren have gone out on the occasion of these visits as did so last year: a decided improvement. The regional directors have themselves placed a total of 10,998 books and booklets, and in their work have traveled 37,067 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">That this work is better for the brethren themselves, as well as that it directly makes for increase in the one needful thing, the witness, is very certain. It is certainly better every way to be out in the open air carrying the message to others, than to sit in a room trying to keep awake while a pilgrim would talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SERVICE CONVENTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">These conventions, of which 25 have been held, have been particularly helpful First, they have helped a good many brethren to see that we as a people are called for a purpose, the work of God, and not merely to enjoy the good things of the truth or pleasant times of fellowship. At these conventions 6,557 bound volumes have been placed with the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The general conditions of life in these countries are much as they were twelve months ago. It is true that the number Of those who receive unemployment money is now well over the two million figure; but this doubling of the numbers during the twelve months past does not mean that there is twice the amount of unemployment, with consequent suffering. By a new arrangement recently made many married women are now allowed to register for the unemployment benefit. Besides that, many employers have discovered that they can help themselves to its benefits. Their employees are kept working full time, and perhaps overtime, for such a number of days as Will enable the workmen to get the “dole” money. Then, after another short interval these all go back to work. So it is the fact that many are getting this insurance pay and are yet earning as much money as they did when they were on short time at their work. The outcry about bad trade and the large unemployment figures is often made and emphasized for political ends. It should not be allowed to discourage the Lord’s people in their work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">That the regular service to the homes of the people is having effect is frequently demonstrated. An officer highly placed in one of the religious organizations, and which professes great zeal for God and humanity, admitted a short time ago to one of the brethren that he and those with him at their headquarters accepted as a fact that there was no people on earth who stood for God and righteousness as the active members of the IBSA. And what is admitted here must surely be the same everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In every part of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales the witness to Jehovah is given. The colporteurs have gone into the country places and into the villages and hamlets hidden away from the crowds, and the cities and towns are continually canvassed. The freshness of the message—its continuous flow is like clear running streams—gives joy to giver and receiver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Here in the office we have joy in our work helping others to theirs and taking our share.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We have not had the pleasure of a visit from you this year. There is a hearty welcome awaiting you whenever you can find time to come again to Britain. I will repeat what I said last year about your labors; that is, all the brethren represented by this office give thanks to Jehovah God for your service for him, and in their prayers ask for his blessings to continue upon you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is interesting to note also that the new subscribers for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> in Britain this year number 1,204. Others have fallen away, but the fact that new ones have come to the fore shows that the Lord’s campaign company is renewed with fresh members whenever that becomes necessary. His work will be accomplished, regardless of who turns aside or who opposes. The campaign is moving steadfastly on to complete victory, and the praise is given to His name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the 1,203,216 books and booklets placed in the hands of the people in Great Britain, the following other items of work are interesting to report, namely: Parcels dispatched after packing, 26,637; letters received, 44,842; letters sent out, 51,729; letters directed to the workers, 4,363; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletins</span><span class="font5"> printed, 65,000; total sheets printed on local press, 1,164,200.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark372"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark373"></a>BRITISH GUIANA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The local manager reports a great amount of poverty and distress in this land, and an unusual rainy season, which greatly interfered with placing more books in the field. During the year 3,928 books and 1,651 booklets were placed with the people. The brethren are faithfully and earnestly pushing on with the work, however, and are delivering the testimony even as the Lord has commanded. Like other parts of the earth, there is only a remnant in that land, but they are zealous and fully devoted to the Lord. There are three colporteurs regularly in the field, twenty workers, and the average weekly service is fourteen.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark374"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark375"></a>CANADA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The campaign of education in Canada has not decreased, but there has been an increase; fewer workers in the field, but greater effort has been put forth, and the results are better. The arm of the Lord is not shortened, but he carries on his work and will accomplish his purpose just exactly as he wishes it, and this in due season.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The local manager gives a brief summary of the work, and this is here inserted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">LITERATURE DISTRIBUTED: The gospel of the kingdom must be preached in harmony with the Lord’s command, and the faithful remnant in this country have joyfully laid hold upon the opportunities offered of singing forth his praises, with most excellent results, particularly when the general conditions that have prevailed in this country throughout the past year are taken into consideration. The total number of bound volumes placed was 194,106, and the number of booklets, 471,956; making a grand total of 666,062. This shows a slight increase in bound volumes over last year, but a decrease in booklets. This, however, is accounted for by the fact that last year’s total embodied the Peoples </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Friend</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> booklet, large numbers of which the friends placed gratis. It is interesting to note in this connection that while the workers were considerably less in number this year, the actual hours put in the service exceeded last year by 11,311.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In looking over our records of the placement of books and booklets since the ban against the Society’s literature in Canada was raised, it is most encouraging to find that this has reached the splendid total of 3,934,533. I question very much if over 50,000 books and booklets were distributed in this country in the whole history of the church prior to that date. Truly, we have cause to be thankful for the many opportunities of telling forth his praises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The special drive weeks have been a source of great stimulus to the friends in their work, and their appreciation of these concentrated efforts is evidenced by the fact that with each succeeding drive the number engaging in the service and the results obtained have increased, coming to a climax in the Testimonies Week, which has by far surpassed any other witness ever given in so short a period of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During the year there has been the usual opposition by the clergy and petty officials, but it has not been as great as heretofore. In a number of instances we have been required to fight, but, by the Lord’s grace, we have been successful and the cases againstus have been dismissed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">COLPORTEURS: The high-water mark of the number of colporteurs in the service during the year was 125, as compared with 104 last year; and the average number monthly was 87, as compared with 65. While this little army of faithful workers report much greater difficulty in placing literature this year, nevertheless their total results are 27,514 in excess of 1929.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is particularly encouraging to note how, time and time again, the Lord uses them to bring the light of truth and comfort and strength to those who are in despair. One colporteur has reported an experience where the prospect was so very poor that she was quite unable to buy anything. Receiving her promise, however, that she would read it, the Sister left her a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Harp.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Later she again encountered this woman and found her rejoicing in the truth and was informed by her that at the time she was canvassing her a cup of poison lay on the table between them and she was waiting for the courage to drink it. Such an experience surely more than repays one for the difficulties encountered in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVENTIONS: An outstanding feature of the year’s activity has been the holding of 195 conventions, a large proportion of which were in the isolated and scattered districts. This means of service resulted in the splendid showing of 17,692 books and 69,433 booklets, a total of 87,125 pieces of literature. Not alone were these conventions used, in the Lord’s providence, as a means of giving an excellent witness concerning his kingdom, but they were also a source of much encouragement and strength to the friends, particularly those in isolated districts, aw</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">akenin</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">g them to renewed zeal and a greater determination to press on in the great battle for truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RADIO: During the year the number of radio stations engaged for singing forth the message of truth totaled 10, including V08A at St. John’s, Newfoundland. While we were successful in having only CROC of Hamilton in the watch-tower network I am happy to state that the radio lectures as published in The </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watch Tower,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> in conjunction with questions and answers, dialogues, etc., and good musical programs, have been broadcast over the other stations. This form of witnessing has been used of the Lord as an instrument to break down much prejudice, and today the workers everywhere testify to the fact that, generally speaking, their reception by the public is very encouraging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REGIONAL. SERVICE DIRECTORS: This feature of the service has been blessed by the Lord to the encouragement of the friends, particularly in assisting them to more thoroughly and efficiently organize their service, with the result that the work in the classes as a whole is well in hand. During the year many letters have been received from the brethren testifying to the assistance this branch of the service has been to them and particularly commending those regional service directors who are abounding in the service and setting an enthusiastic example in the field work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BOAT SERVICE: During the summer months we have had two boats in operation, one working the villages and hamlets along the shores of Newfoundland and Labrador and the other active on the Pacific coast. Both have given a very good account of themselves, having placed during the season 5,424 books and 13,481 booklets, a total of 18,905. The work is very much of a pioneer nature, and oftentimes those serving meet with perils of the elements that are otherwise, generally speaking, seldom experienced. The following is characteristic of the reports being received from Newfoundland:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“This week we have had our usual share of trying experiences, also a day’s delay through gales; but, with it all, the Lord’s favor and approval have been manifested in a most remarkable way. Not only were the experiences particularly refreshing, but, in addition, the Lord has given me the best day in all my service experience when last Friday I was privileged to place 125 books and booklets. In all I spent 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">hours in the work and made 29 calls. Occasionally a dumb dog commences to bark, but, true to the prophecy of Isaiah, they are too lazy to bark long, and soon quit. Thus, an indignant shepherd waved his arms and raved to us this week, but all to no avail The Lord’s Word says ‘they shall proceed no further’, and so it is. At M---- a blind man was literally</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">overjoyed to hear the kingdom message. His sightless eyes shone with enthusiasm as certain paragraphs from books were read to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> He and his people took gladly the message that would bring cheer and comfort of heart. He would hardly let me go, but kept shaking my hand saying, ‘God bless you,’ and, ‘I know it’s true.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">‘ ‘ In two other places were men who had read </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Harp</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Deliverance.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> They are right in the truth and took a full set of volumes. One included a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> subscription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“The point of service cannot be stressed too highly at this time. Many humble, honest hearts are seeking ‘bread’ and there is none in their prison-house. The Lord has committed into our care the ‘bread of life’; and should we slack our hands or become negligent at this time, we would have cause to regret forever the loss of this golden opportunity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FOREIGN: The work among the Ukrainian-speaking people under the direction of Brother E. Zarysky is now well in hand, and, while he has very carefully and faithfully looked after the interests of the kingdom committed to his care among the people of this language, I regret to state that the Ukrainians do not seem to enter into the witnessing work through the avenue of the books and booklets as wholeheartedly as we would wish. These brethren still seem prone to hold to the old-fashioned idea of meetings, which have proven to be of little or no value so far as a means of giving the testimony itself is concerned. They do not seem to be awake to the fact that a Christian is a worker; that his business is to be actively engaged in the service work day by day as opportunity affords. As a consequence, the amount of Ukrainian literature placed in this country has not been large, but I am hopeful that before the final work is accomplished they will realize their duties and privileges and lay hold thereon with a greater zeaL</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">While the Ukrainian brethren have not been as active as we would have liked, I am pleased to report that; on the other hand, the French brethren in Quebec have been very zealous indeed and a good witness has been carried on in that province. Prejudice is being broken down, and the French are, to a considerable degree, rallying to the truth. They are continually calling for more books in their language, particularly stressing their hope that these will be of the same high standard of workmanship and composition as the English books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FINANCIAL CONDITIONS: The general economic depression in this country has also made itself felt among the Lord’s people, and this has to a considerable degree been reflected in the contributions to Good Hopes. As you will observe from the statement, the total donations are many thousands of dollars less than last year, and as a consequence we have been required to curtail our activities to a considerable degree, cutting down expenses wherever possible, in order to meet the situation. The Lord, however, has supplied all our needs according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus and has thus enabled us to accomplish the witness that has been made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During the year it has been my privilege to visit the friends in Newfoundland and throughout Canada as far west as Calgary. Just recently I returned from a visit to the Prairie provinces. Wherever I have been I have found conditions most distressing and fear laying hold upon those in high places. In large areas the drought has been so severe that many have seen their entire crops destroyed, while in sections where there have been good crops the markets have been so manipulated that the prices obtained have not been sufficient to cover their growing and harvesting. In fact, conditions are so bad in some parts of the Prairie provinces that people in desperation have been compelled to eat gophers to keep themselves from starvation. In industrial centers the manufacturers have reduced their production, and as a consequence large numbers of men and women have been thrown out of employment. Never before in the history of this country has the unemployment situation been so serious, and never have conditions on the whole looked so black. These conditions, however, are causing many to wonder what it all means, and I am happy to say that'the remnant class from their vantage point have taken advantage of the situation to make the testimony known. While the friends are few in number, they are, from my own personal observation and from reports received from the regional service directors, in excellent condition spiritually. They know that the culmination of all things is at hand and that those who endure unto the end in the work of the Lord shall be granted an abundant entrance into his kingdom. So with a burnin</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">g</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">, fiery zeal they are pressing the sword at the gate, knowing that he that is for them is greater than all that can be against them and will bring them off more than conquerors through Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Throughout the year the brethren have been greatly strengthened and fortified by the flashes of light coming from the temple through the channel of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> particularly outstanding as a source of help, strength and encouragement to the friends being the books </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Light.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> The timely and most wonderful message which they contain has been received With joy and gladness into the hearts and minds of the friends everywhere, and has given them fresh impetus to press on in their battle against the forces of darkness. It is very evident to one and all that the things shown therein are shortly to come to pass: the time is at hand!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In accordance with many requests, I am happy indeed to convey to you the love and greeting of the Canadian friends and to assure you of their whole-hearted support in your every effort to sing forth the praises of him who has called us from darkness into his marvelous light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is a joy to note the zeal with which the staff here lay hold upon their opportunities of service, not only in the office and factory, but also in the field work week by week, with splendid results. These faithful workers are desirous of joining me in conveying to you our wannest love and best wishes, and we assure you of our prayers at all times.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark376"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark377"></a>CENTRAL EUROPEAN BRANCH</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The countries under the jurisdiction of this office are, to wit: Switzerland, France, Belgium, Holland, Poland, Austria, Yugoslavia. Because of the volume of the work and the many details it will be necessary to print the report of the Central European office under these various countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In order to meet the attacks of the adversary it became necessary to register the Society in certain countries, and consequently registration has been made in France, in Austria and in Yugoslavia. The clergy have put forth a desperate effort to prevent this, but have not succeeded. In many of these countries it was necessary to employ legal talent to represent the Society, but this was deemed the Lord’s will and it was done. In a number of the places the brethren were arrested under the charge of blasphemy against God, but upon trial were acquitted. In Innsbruck, Austria, a Catholic priest caused the arrest and imprisonment for nineteen days of a brother on a charge of saying that God is a devil, and that Mary had four children. At the end of this confinement he was put on trial before a Catholic court, and the defense succeeded in getting the Bible in evidence and then the Catholics admitted that the defendant was right, and he was discharged. It resulted in a testimony for the Lord’s Word. This is a sample of the difficulties the brethren must encounter in giving the witness in such countries as Austria and other like Catholic countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the countries above named there are 228 organized classes, 4,000 members, and an average of 1,550 regular workers. In addition to this, 73 colporteurs and 38 auxiliary colporteurs. During the year the bound books have been placed in the hands of the people as never before in these countries. The total number of books was 150,010, and booklets 1,014,029. A total of 209,357 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> and 5,150 Bibles were placed in the hands of the people. The distribution of books during the year is practically double that of the year previous. Here is another evidence that the Lord’s hand was over his little ones. The result eould have been accomplished in no other way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The result of the two service weeks shows the blessing of the Lord. The local manager says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The remnant was like a lion amongst the beasts of the forests. The 15,000-Hour Week was an answer to the challenge of the oppressor of the people and the enemy of Jehovah. Sixteen hundred stood in line and fought valiantly for 16,000 hours. There were 190 workers less than engaged in the May service, but an increase of 2,100 hours worked, and an increase of 15,500 more books and booklets put in the hands of the people. The total distribution during this week amounted to 78,400 books and booklets. Some of the dear brethren worked even 68 hours during this week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Figuring the total output during this year in pages contained in the books and booklets, the grand total is 114,900,000 pages of literature containing the convincing message that Jehovah is arising to scatter the Devil’s organization and establish his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For some time we had not been manufacturing bound books in Switzerland; but because of the increased interest in France and other countries, new machinery has recently been installed in Berne, and the bound books are now made there in certain languages, and the prospects are for a full year’s work ahead even now. Although these machines for bound books have been in operation for only a short time, the work at the Berne factory during the year has produced the following: Books 34,858; booklets 1,227,917; magazines, including </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletins,</span><span class="font5"> 703,389; other leaflets, etc., printed, 415,482; letters received at the Berne office, 9,530, and dispatched, 7,761.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year the inhabitants of Switzerland received a thorough witness in the German, French, Italian and Roman languages. In Switzerland three times as many books were placed as during the previous year, to wit: books, 33,431; booklets, 221,362. These were put in the hands of the people by 2 pioneer colporteurs and 3 auxiliary colporteurs, and 350 class workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For several years the enemy has attempted to prevent the colporteur work in Switzerland. The matter was taken into the courts, and the courts finally decided that the work of the Society is a charitable and benevolent one in the interest of mankind, and now it goes on. The gratifying part is that the bound books are increasing in number in Switzerland as well as in other countries. From a recent decision handed down by the court in Berne, the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is proven that Schuetz has sold books, however in such a way that no profit was obtained either by the one charged or by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, which is proven by the statements of the defendant, and by the witness Seiler, and that the Society sustains a loss instead of obtaining gain. Therefore one cannot speak here of commerce regarding that which the charged one has committed, and therefore there is no offence against him as a peddler. The accused one is therefore acquitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is another evidence, though it may be small, that the political branch of the governments is discovering that the clergy are hypocrites, and indicates what may follow. We are grateful to the Lord for this evidence of his favor in Switzerland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The repeated attempts at arresting and persecuting the Lord’s witnesses in Switzerland have been turned as a witness against the enemy, and have opened the way for a wider distribution of the books, and therefore a greater witness than otherwise could have been given. Our brethren in other places should take courage from this and know that the Lord is back of his people and will bring them through to victory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bethel family at Berne, Switzerland, during the year put books and booklets in the hands of the people to the number of 28,423. In Switzerland, during the year 52 public meetings have been held; 604 class meetings; 6 service conventions, and one general convention. There is one regional service director, and there are 20 auxiliaries. The work in Switzerland is progressing satisfactorily and to the Lord’s praise.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark378"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark379"></a>AUSTRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In spite of the many handicaps and persecutions in Austria, the work there progresses. There are now 12 pioneer colporteurs and 12 auxiliary colporteurs in the field, and others are preparing to enter quickly. The persecution of the brethren by the clergy is resisted in the courts, and wherever it can be lawfully done. There are 14 organized classes in Austria; and 350 brethren assemble at these meetings for study, and 200 of them regularly participate in the active service. During the year the class workers have placed in the hands of the people, books 21,649, booklets 76,833, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> 7,616 copies; colporteurs, books 6,533, booklets 19,962, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> 2,425 copies. Total output, 28,182 books, 96,795 booklets, 10,041 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is an increase of 5,000 more books placed in the hands of the people this year than the previous year. The booklets, however, are somewhat less. The work is progressing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year two service conventions were held, attended by 700 brethren. Five public meetings, with an attendance of 2,550 persons, were held. There is one regional service director in the field, and other class assistants. Some opposition has been shown by those who were once in the truth, but those who really love the Lord are more united than ever.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark380"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark381"></a>BELGIUM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There are four organized classes in Belgium, and 46 brethren who speak the native tongue. During service week 27 participated in the service. There are three pioneers and three auxiliary colporteurs in the field. The latter are 63 and 75 years of age respectively, but are diligent “young men”. During the year some of the brethren have come from England and Switzerland and some from France to aid in the work in Belgium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Books distributed during the year by class workers, colporteurs and auxiliaries were 3,414; booklets 52,860, and magazines 231. This is a decided increase over the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In March, 1930, a convention was held in Brussels, attended by 80 brethren, and out of this 80, twelve nations or languages were represented. During the year 9 public meetings were held. It is reported that all the classes study </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font5"> and greatly rejoice in this food the Lord provides for them. During the year 381 letters were received, and 281 cards; and a total of 689 dispatched. The work in Belgium, heretofore </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">small</span><span class="font5">, is increasing to the Lord’s glory.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark382"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark383"></a>ESPERANTO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There are quite a number of people in Europe who use the Esperanto language, and during the year some work has been done in this behalf. Booklets, magazines, etc., to the number of 2,909 have been placed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark384"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark385"></a>FRANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">From the report of the local office the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lord’s work in France has gone forward by leaps and bounds during the past year, and judging the work by the amount of literature distributed, France is in the lead as compared with other European countries. This, of course, is taking into consideration the work in previous years. It is exactly double what it was last year. The brethren now employ 63 motorcycles and three automobiles in the service in France, and are thus able to get over much territory in a short time. The brethren have bought these motorcycles on tune, and some of the sisters are working in factories to help pay for them, and spend part of the time in the service. The brethren in France are very much encouraged and are pressing on with the work with renewed zeal</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Further quoting from the local manager:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s people in this land recognize clearly that the time for the kingdom and its proclamation as well as the vindication of the name of Jehovah has come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many of the workers are not able to speak the French language. The office has prepared for them a card, and this is used in calling upon the people. During the year the distribution has been as follows: French class workers, 19,736 books, 137,802 booklets, 15,820 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age;</span><span class="font5"> Polish class workers, 17,843 books, 184,940 booklets, 54,022 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age;</span><span class="font5"> pioneer and auxiliary colporteurs, 11,280 books, 93,425 booklets, 274 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age;</span><span class="font5"> making the total output 48,859 books, 416,167 booklets, and 70,116 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At present there are 27 colporteurs engaged, as follows: 6 Swiss, 2 Danish, 2 Belgian, 9 English, 2 Polish, 1 German, 4 Alsatian, and 1 French.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are 56 organized classes in France, 45 Polish and 11 French. The French office in Paris carries literature in 27 different languages. During the May service week, the French and Polish brethren to the number of 559 engaged in the service work for 4,395 hours, and placed 1,387 books, 17,801 booklets, 77 Bibles, and 1,749 magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the 15,000-Hour Week 654 brethren engaged in the service 5,055 hours, and placed 1,633 books, 19,807 booklets, 134 Bibles, and 1,623 magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Five regional service conventions were held during the year, and at these conventions the workers placed 8,575 booklets and 442 bound books. The French also had a convention, at which the workers placed 700 booklets and 35 books. Ninety brethren were baptized; ten of them were French and the others were Polish and other nationalities. There is one regional service director for the Polish brethren and one French regional service director in the service. Representatives of the opposition came from America and tried to disrupt the work It not only failed, but caused the loyal ones to become more zealous than ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RADIO</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society has a favorable contract with a radio station in Paris. Since the 1st of March 52 radio lectures have been given, 9 in English and 43 in French. The facilities of this station are being increased, and better results are looked for in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ALSACE-LORRAINE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society maintains a depot at Strasbourg. This section belongs to France, but its population is largely German. A radio station at this point has broadcast 23 truth lectures during the year. The prospects for the radio here henceforth are better, as a definite arrangement has been made for broadcasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SARRE BASIN</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society also has a depot at Sarre Basin, which is German territory but also occupied by the French. Four classes are here actively engaged in the service. The clergy have put forth a strenuous opposition, but have not succeeded.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark386"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark387"></a>HOLLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In Holland there are eight Dutch classes and one Polish. These are zealous for the Lord and his cause. In one of the classes there has been some disruption because of disloyalty, and some have left; but those remaining true and faithful are more zealous than ever, and the work goes grandly on. There are now 60 class workers, and one pioneer and three auxiliary colporteurs. Distribution of the literature during the year follows: Books 7,461; booklets 49,189. Two weeks during the year were set aside for special service and these were attended by good results.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark388"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark389"></a>ITALY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There is little to report from Italy, except that there now seems good prospect of the authorities’ permitting the brethren to work. Because of the strenuous opposition there has been no organization in Italy. Only 150 books and booklets have been distributed during the year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark390"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark391"></a>POLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There has been some increase in the work in Poland, notwithstanding many handicaps. The local brother in charge reports: “The economic and social conditions are very bad, making our work difficult. Those who engage in the work do so with much sacrifice, but with great willingness and joy.” The number of classes organized for service is now 55. There are 25 smaller groups which are also striving to give a witness for Jehovah as best they can. There are now thirty full-time colporteurs and fifteen auxiliaries in the field. During the year the class workers distributed 18,377 books and 95,904 booklets. The colporteurs put out 9,219 books and 76,965 booklets. In addition thereto, 3,316 Bibles were placed in the hands of the people, making a total of 203,781. These were in the Polish, Ukrainian, German and Russian languages. A service week of 6,000 hours was set recently, but at the end of the fiscal year not all the reports were in. The report, however, showed a distribution of 4,460 books and 13,425 booklets, with 578 persons engaged in the service. A general convention was held during the year at Warsaw. At this convention 150 brethren put out 1300 books and booklets. A special effort to place the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Scripture Studies </span><span class="font5">was made in March, with the result that 570 sets were distributed, and later 845 sets. Seventy-eight thousand sample copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> were distributed during the year, and this aroused the clergy, and they have tried to destroy the work. The clergy induced the Minister of the Interior to deny </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> admission to the mail, but shortly thereafter he was compelled to resign, and his successor restored </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> to the mailing privileges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Three regional service directors are in the field, and these have organized the classes and led them into the field with much joy and good results. During the year 504 meetings were held, with an attendance of 12,458 persons. Four hundred seventy-six public meetings, with an attendance of 53,313, were held. Seven brethren are employed at the office, and are zealously putting forth their endeavors to carry on the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It becomes necessary for the Society to move its headquarters because of being compelled to give up the building. It seems it will be necessary to purchase property in order to have a permanent place for carrying on the work. This will entail considerable expense, but many zealous brethren will be anxious to see this done, and the Lord will provide the means, we believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the report of the manager of the Central European office the following extract is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In closing this report may I express to you, Brother Rutherford, that I appreciate very much the small part I have had in this work and that it has been a great joy to watch the Lord’s visible manifestation of power in the guidance, the protection and the blessing upon his work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The greatest blessing I have had during the year was my trip to America and the part I had in translating the new books </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Light.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> The day-star has arisen and the perfect light shines with the brilliancy of the sun upon the faithful temple class. What greater joy could there be than to be living in this day, to be guided and protected by the holy angels, and to have a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I have been watching for the light that has come to me through these two books; I find myself in absolute harmony therewith, and I pray daily that the heavenly Father may ever keep me in his favor.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark392"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark393"></a>YUGOSLAVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Long in darkness, Yugoslavia seems to be opening for a wider witness to the truth. A man of political influence, and a personal friend of the king, has recently embraced the truth. Together with 16 others he was recently baptized. He has begun to render good service under the Society’s direction. There are five classes in Yugoslavia, each one organized for service. About 25 brethren participate regularly in the service. The work is really just beginning. During the year 1,052 books and 4,243 booklets were placed in the hands of the people. These were chiefly in the German, Serbian, Croatian and Slovenian languages. During the year 50 meetings were held, with an attendance of 3,984. The brethren are united in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Recently the Society has registered in Yugoslavia, and this will doubtless furnish a better opportunity for giving a public witness.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark394"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark395"></a>GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The apostle emphasized the fact that suffering for Christ’s sake is an evidence of the Lord’s use of one thus suffering. Jesus himself declared that those who would be faithful to him would have tribulation. Our brethren in Germany have had their share of it during the fiscal year just closing. This persecution and opposition has all come from Satan, and particularly through his agents the clergy. Together these have made it necessary for the Society to defend more than 1500 lawsuits, a number of which are not yet settled. They attempted to stop the preaching of the gospel on Sunday. Nothing would show them to be great hypocrites more than that. In addition to this opposition, the Society has had its financial difficulties because of a bank failure in Germany. In spite of all, however, there has been a tremendous increase in the work in Germany. The campaign has moved steadily forward. The distribution of bound books during the fiscal year has increased 150 percent. It is gratifying to see the Lord’s guiding hand in the work in Germany. It is also a joy to witness the zeal of the brethren who continue to press the battle for the kingdom and righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because of the increased work it has been necessary to increase the housing facilities as well as the equipment for the factory. During the year the new method of class organization and campaign work has been put in operation in Germany, and the results have shown the Lord’s blessing upon this effort. The local manager covered in a comprehensive way the work in Germany, and from his report I quote the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lord acted &quot;very graciously in all the matters regarding the service he committed to us and he added his blessing to the efforts made by his people. There was an astonishing progress since the summer of 1929, the time when yon gave us the instructions necessary for better organizing the work. Especially since then we have had the experience that obedience, and recognition of the fact that the work of the Lord is one all over the earth, is followed by good results. To be sure, there are differences in special conditions of the single countries, but the main features of the work of Jehovah are the same everywhere; and there is no way more advisable for any branch office of the Society than to carefully note all the information and instructions received from headquarters and to obey them; and in turn all the classes in every country could not do better than to observe the instructions gotten from their respective offices. The results will then be quite wonderful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Bi the year before the number of bound books distributed was about half a million. For this year it is increased by 150 percent, viz., 1,234,653 bound books; and further, about three million booklets. Every particle of the general instructions was noted, and thereby it was also possible to place 32,405 sets of 5, 6 or 7 books. Distribution of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> also increased, viz., from 7.9 to 8.6 millions. The number of classes organized for service was increased from 444 to 510; the number of regular class workers increased from 8,894 to 9,281; number of colporteurs and auxiliary colporteurs increased from 49 to 220; and the ever-increasing light of the truth resulted in more joy of all the classes and in more appreciation of the privilege of service in all the hearts of the friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is quite natural that the enemy was not idle, too, as you will see from the special report of the Department of Law. Four hundred thirty-four new legal proceedings were instituted during the year, making, together with suits pending from past years, the number of 1,552; of which 609 were settled, 566 thereof with verdicts of not guilty and 43 with condemnation or f</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ailing</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the fixed term.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The latest efforts of the enemy are in the direction of hindering the work on Sundays by arresting the friends because of “profanation of the Lord’s Day’’. No ultimate decision is reached even now in this fight. Verdicts of guilty were rendered in some cases, but we are determined to vindicate ourselves to the utmost with all legal means against this robbery of our holy rights to witness for the name of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Closely connected with the increasing results in the field is the increase of activity in the Bible House. With the kind permission of the president, a further plot of land was acquired, adjoining our former real estate. The old buildings which were situated on that ground were taken down, and with the old material the brethren are building a large living house with dining room for the Bethel members, which work is now incessantly progressing to completion. The great truths that Jehovah has set his anointed King upon his throne and that henceforth and forever no power of the earth will be able to stop the onward movement of the Lord’s army have been proven to us all the year round a thousandfold in the blessed service of the Lord, in all our experiences and in the guidance and help graciously received from Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is our prayer, dear brother, that the Lord may strengthen and encourage you to joyfully persevere and go on in carrying out the very blessed service you are appointed to, viz., to spur on Jehovah’s people to zealous witness for the name of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The peoples of Germany have endured great hardships and suffering since the beginning of the World War. The disturbed conditions continue in that land, as they do in other parts of the earth, and the people continue to suffer. The sober-minded ones have looked for relief, and many of them are coming to a knowledge of the fact that relief can come only through God’s kingdom. These therefore realize that the Society is doing a tremendous work for the good of Germany, and when they see the opposition put forth against this work, they know that that opposition proceeds from Satan the enemy, because he is the one that attempts to destroy God’s people and his kingdom. Happy will be the day when Satan’s organiza-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">tion is eliminated and the truth will fill the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font5">ds of the people to the glory of God. We rejoice with our German brethren in their continued zeal for the Lord and in the blessings that he bestows upon them as a result of their labors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For convenience the work of Hungary, Luxemburg, Czechoslovakia and Rumania is conducted through the German branch, and while there is great opposition in these countries, exercised by those who claim to be representatives of the Lord, still his work makes progress. A brief resume of the work in these countries is here set forth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark396"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark397"></a>CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">From the report of the manager the following excerpt is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah has richly blessed his witnesses in Czechoslovakia during the year now past. The number of workers increased from 120 to 180 in average, and the number of pioneers increased also. Most of the friends are living in districts where the standard of education is very low. As many friends are unable to read or write, and oftentimes are living in conditions of worst poverty and do not have proper clothing besides their frocks, they are generally not in position to perform effective work. For that reason the main part of the activity is to be borne by the pioneers sent to those districts. During this fiscal year a number of German brethren (from Germany) entered the pioneer service in Czechoslovakia and have done some real good work in territories with German-speaking population. Some territories in Bohemia and Moravia near the German border have been assigned to classes in Germany, and friends of these classes leave on Sundays for these far-away districts in Czechoslovakia to work there. Being foreigners, they often meet great difficulties with the police, and there were some arrests, but all these cases were settled to content. In that way, these German friends distribute many books and booklets in Czechoslovakia. In general the turnover of literature in that country was good as never before, nearly four times as much having been distributed compared with the year before, and also booklets were distributed to a number which is more than one and a half times what it was before. Besides the colporteurs, of the Czechoslovakian friends mainly those speaking Hungarian and German participated in the work, and the Slovakian friends are becoming more busy now. The friends of Rumanian tongue have not much possibility for working, as there are only a few Rumanian villages in Czechoslovakia. A great number of the Russian friends have been taken prisoner by the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Summing up it can be said that in the year now past the greatest witness yet has been given in Czechoslovakia. For the coming year we trust in the Lord and his aid for a further progress in his work.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark398"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark399"></a>HUNGARY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The enemy still has a strong grip on Hungary. The Lord’s children, however, never quit work because some part of the enemy’s organization interferes. As long as the Lord leaves the door of opportunity open they will continue, by his grace. From the local manager’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The situation has not changed in Hungary. Distributing literature and assembling it is still forbidden, and there is scarcely any liberty of movement for the friends. These would gladly go out proclaiming the kingdom of God, but the least possible attempt in that direction is immediately suppressed by police. Only amongst friends and acquaintances can the witness be given. Even in their own homes the friends are not left undisturbed by the authorities. During most of this year a brother tried to work as pioneer, and he would have had better results if he could have worked from door to door, and from place to place. But the police was always at his heels and he oftentimes had to run many kilometers to get out of some district, where they sought him for arrest, and to continue his work in another place. For that reason he can hardly keep himself and he may be forced again to take a secular busmess. Some brethren of Budapest try to work as auxiliary pioneers. Their work, too, was hindered much by the existing conditions, though the work is easier in this large city than in rural districts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In spite of so many difficulties to be overcome, the friends were able to place with the people nearly double the number of books and booklets they placed last year. Taken in all, the friends make all endeavors possible in order to serve the</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark406"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark407"></a>LUXEMBURG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Luxemburg is a new field, but not a very promising one. The enemy has been strong there for many years. The Society, however, feeling its obligation to give the witness, has made an attempt. Concerning the results the following is quoted from the local manager’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Though in this small country, which is perfectly under the influence of the Catholic church, the first steps for giving a witness of the kingdom of God were taken only a short time ago, the best progress has been made since. The population of this small country is mostly German and French, but men of all European countries meet one another in the industrial centers. There is much hindrance to real energetic work by the fact that canvassing is still forbidden. In spite of that, two pioneers (a married couple) are eagerly going on in the work and get the Lord’s blessing. The Devil tried what he could to hinder them, but all in vain. During the year eight legal proceedings because of ‘infringement of the law for peddler’s trade’ have been instituted against this brother, but verdicts regarding these have not yet been rendered, and both pioneers continue their work and do not mind the disturbances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">There are now some subscribers for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and two sisters of a foreign country took their residence in Luxemburg. At one place meetings are held for interested persons every week, with a number of attendants from ten to twelve on the average. It may be expected that some class workers will be in the field in a short time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Pictures and films of the old </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Photodrama of Creation</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> were taken, together with new texts, mainly taken from the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and other new books, and thus an up-to-date picture work in accord with the present truth was made, and as in several cities of Germany, a pioneer work with that was opened in Luxemburg. Efforts were made since long to show this picture work and hold the accompanying addresses, but it was impossible for a good while to find a hall. If we were nearly to rent a hall, the hirelings of Borne knew how to influence the owner of the respective establishment, so that he would not enter into contract. But the Lord overruled this matter like all the others; within a short time permission of the government for that performance was received, a hall with a seating capacity of about 500 persons was at our disposal, and other possibilities for undertaking something were given. Ere the tools of the Devil were able to step up to this, the performance was going on. It was too late to spoil anything, though the Roman press was grumbling and cursing; and the warnings they published in newspapers were the best advertisement for us. The hall was filled every day, with a daily average of 500 persons, with whom were placed 300 books and more than 800 booklets, from book tables, as going about with books in the hall was forbidden. More than 80 persons left their addresses, and 22 subscribed for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> To be sure, a very pretty success by that work. (In the same manner of working with this in Germany, during the last time 23 new classes were founded, one of them with 100 friends, some of which are coworking already.)</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark408"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark409"></a>RUMANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren are familiar with conditions that have existed for a long while in Rumania as published in former reports. Although greatly handicapped, there are some zealous brethren there who still continue to give testimony to the name of Jehovah and to his kingdom. The Judas class, or “man of sin”, is active in that land and causes the faithful real suffering. The Lord seems to indicate, however, that there is still some work to be done, and a greater effort will be made in the near future to give a more extensive witness to that land. From the local manager’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The zeal of the friends in the Lord’s work is increasing, and they are refreshed by the present truth as published in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Many classes started an activity in canvassing in spite of severe persecutions, and some are informing us already that they undertook canvassing drives together and nobody had hindered them. They derived much blessing from their zeal. Especially of the Rumanian brethren of Hungarian tongue can be said they are going onward courageously and wish to do better, and the classes of Rumanian language are getting up here and there. It should be expected that new booklets and books would mean a good increase in turnover of literature. The authorities are persecuting the friends as before, though in single cases the police officers are very tolerant. Some who have been brethren undertook to draw after themselves many friends, especially Rumanian-speaking ones, but they are still unable to impress those who stood faithfully. Some regional service directors are encouraging the friends and spur them on to activity. Most of them had to suffer arrest and imprisonment because of visiting the classes, and this suffering was due to denunciation by those who have been brethren. But these brethren are not discouraged thereby, and continue their service, oftentimes under the worst privations. Greater opportunities for service Beem to be near at hand, as many friends are informing us of greater liberty of movement they had in the last time, and of a more tolerant attitude of the officials. In all, there seems to be given a greater witness to the truth in Rumania.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The population is very poor, possibly more than in many other countries, and for that reason it is more easy to place booklets. The turnover of booklets this year is three times what it was in the last year, but even bound books were spread, some hundred more than before. The witness work of the kingdom of God was definitely greater than ever before in Rumania, and much blessing was the reward of the efforts of the friends.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark416"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark417"></a>GREECE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The iron hand continues to rule in Greece, ably supported by the hypocritical clergy, who as tools of Satan do everything in their power to hinder the work. In spite of all this, the brethren in Greece this year have pushed forward and have made a splendid showing. Their zeal has not been cooled by opposition, but rather they have been spurred on to greater action. The local manager reports the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We thank our heavenly Father as we look back and see the blessings which he bestowed upon us in his work. Many times has the enemy tried to stop the work, both in the post office, where they tried to impose a heavy custom duty on the books which came as printed matter, which would prevent the import of the books, and through a public prosecutor of one of the courts of appeal, who sent a document to the Government of Greece, as well as a circular to the other courts and police officials, urging the stopping of the work. As a result of this the Minister of the Interior asked for our books, to examine them in order to decide if they should be free to circulate. But the Lord has been with his little ones until now, according to his promise, covering them with his mighty hand, that they may be able to give the witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lord opened the way for the witness work to reach the officials of Greece, who heard about the establishment of the kingdom of righteousness; also the judges in the courts had the same opportunity at the trials of the brethren in many parts of Greece, where Satan has demonstrated all his ability as a slanderer through his representatives, the clergy, to whom is given all the liberty to witness and to speak against the brethren, while the witnesses on the defense are forbidden to prove that all this is a lie. Notwithstanding all the assaults of the adversary, the Lord blessed His work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is true that we had no great output of books this year, owing to the destruction of production in many parts of the land by the hail and to the general crisis, because of which many people were unable to take even booklets. In some parts people not having money to give for books offered eggs instead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">This year two regional service directors from time to time visited the different classes, encouraging the brethren. There have also been twenty colporteurs who spent more or less of their time in the field. It is true that the work of the colporteurs here in Greece is very difficult, owing to the prejudice of the people and the resistance of the local police officials in many parts, which causes heavy expenses for the brethren. In some parts the colporteurs had to sleep in the open air, because no accommodations were available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">There was held a general convention at Salonica last spring, which was greatly blessed by the Lord. Many of the classes after that convention worked with greater zeal, through the class workers, not only covering their territory, but also sending workers to other parts where no classes existed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work conducted this year is as follows:</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark430"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark431"></a>INDIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">India is a vast field peopled by those who are extremely poor and greatly oppressed under satanie reign. Millions are groaning and travailing in pain, waiting for the manifestation of God’s kingdom. It is the blessed privilege of the Society to have a few in that land to engage in the witness that Jehovah is God, and that his kingdom will bring the desired relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work in India, though having to contend with many handicaps, is steadfastly progressing. From the report of the local manager the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is always a pleasure to be able to report an increase in the work of the Lord’s anointed ones, and a review of this year’s activities again shows an increase, both in the number of workers and the amount of literature put into circulation. The total number of books and booklets disposed of during the year is 63,732, compared with 48,662 last year. Whilst this figure may seem small when compared with the figures of western countries, yet it represents the zealous service of a mere handful of workers whose work must often be done under very trying conditions on account of the tropical heat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Indian field may be divided into two sections. There is the work of bearing witness to the comparatively small English and Anglo-Indian population, and then there is the vast native Indian population. Of a population of well over three hundred millions only about five millions profess to be Christian, and of these the majority are extremely poor and illiterate. The English and Anglo-Indian population is limited and scattered. To reach them all means a good deal of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">tim</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">e and expense in traveling, but we have succeeded in visiting almost every town where a colony of white people live, and it is amongst these that the majority of the bound volumes have been placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The native Indian field presents an almost unlimited scope for work, but it is essential to have vernacular literature for those who cannot read English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">This means a considerable outlay of money, but the Lord has provided sufficient to make a start. During the year the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">World Distress</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> or the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Standard for the People</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> booklet has been translated and printed in Malayalam, Marathi, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and Kanarese, whilst the Burmese and Singalese editions are now on the press. We have also published a condensed edition of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Oppression</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> in Singalese and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Where Are the Dead!</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> in Urdu, besides three booklet-tracts on “Trinity”, “Soul,” and “Some Good News” in Urdu. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Harp of God </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">has been translated into Urdu, but the printing of it is being delayed on account of the expense involved. Unfortunately the Indian Christians are so poor that these vernacular booklets cannot be placed at a rate sufficient to cover the cost if placed by colporteurs who must be supplied with them at the special colporteur rates. The extent of this work is therefore very much limited because of the expense that it involves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">As an example of the above vernacular work, reference may be made to the Punjab. The Punjab is an agricultural district. There are many Indian Christians there, but mostly of the poor, agricultural laboring class, who have had practically no opportunity of schooling. On two occasions a brother visited this district and many lectures were given through an interpreter to crowds of interested, but illiterate, men. Even though illiterate they have sufficient intelligence to recognize the falsity of the creeds of Christendom and to see that the orthodox missionaries have filled their minds with falsehoods concerning the purposes of Jehovah. In every village there are some who can read, and for the benefit of these literature has been prepared in Urdu, their native language. Of course, the Devil got busy and tried to interfere with the progress of truth. Many of these people are measurably dependent upon the missionaries for their material welfare, and some were afraid to openly identify themselves with the truth and its service. More than one mission-worker lost his means of livelihood because of the truth. We have now appointed an exmission school teacher to superintend the distribution of literature and to organize classes in this district. Every month a short article for study is prepared. These are translated into Urdu and copies made on a duplicator, and circulated in twenty-one villages. In this way we are striving to consolidate the interest aroused and help these poor, blinded souls to see the glorious light of truth. These people are so poor as to be unable to take a two-anna booklet. We therefore prepared smaller booklets, more in the nature of a pamphlet, to offer at </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">half</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> an anna each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Whilst reviewing the native </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Indian</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> work, mention might here be made of the work in Travancore. This work has been properly organized several years and continues to show healthy activity. There are now five full-time workers in Travancore, and an average of 42 class workers out each month. There are sixteen organized classes, and five service conventions were arranged for them during the year. These brethren are quite up-to-date in the truth, thanks to the Malayalam edition of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Ford caravan, which you gave us last year, continues to give us good service. Two brothers have traveled about 9,000 miles in it during the year and covered a wide field in a thorough manner. This van enables us to reach the nooks and corners of the territory in a way which would otherwise be impossible. I could wish that another similar van were available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">This year we have been able to give a witness in Ceylon and Burma also. Two brothers visited Ceylon in the early part of the year. They covered the major portion of the island and endeavored to organize the local brethren for service work. Class service work has been disappointing. Many who call themselves ‘brethren’ seem afraid of using up any of their strength or energy in the service of the Lord, It must be said, however, that two sisters in Ceylon have come forward and are now full-time, pioneer colporteurs. These same two brothers afterwards crossed over to Burma and they are now busily engaged in giving a witness in that country. There are a few brethren in Burma and it is hoped that these will now organize themselves for action. Thus our little force is now divided over the three countries comprising this field. It is only a small ‘chariot’ in the Lord’s army, but the spirit of the Lord is in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">With your permission we had our annual vacation in midwinter because that season of the year is most congenial for activity in this country. A service convention was arranged in Madras. It was the first real united service effort ever held in this country. Unfortunately the season was marred by the death of one of our most zealous workers, but those who attended that convention received an impetus for service. Since then we have endeavored to unite with our brethren in other parts of the earth whenever there has been a special drive week, though our numbers are so small and isolated that united work appears to make little difference in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">final</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Ab all the world knows, there is trouble in India. This has not affected our work. It has probably sharpened the people’s interest to inquire into the message of the kingdom. In some districts there is a bitter hatred against anything British or associated with “ Christianity ”, but this prejudice is chiefly confined to the half-educated and the orthodox Hindoos. It is clear that our witness is merely a witness and that the exhibition of Jehovah’s almighty power will need to be displayed before the peoples of India can be released from the bonds of superstitious ignorance and oppression which bind them. As India sinks deeper into the mire of political and commercial uncertainty in her frantic efforts to shake off the British ‘‘taskmaster”, so will our message make its appeal to such as are of an honest heart and who desire that liberty which God purposes his human creation finally shall enjoy.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark432"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark433"></a>JAMAICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord’s anointed in Jamaica are small in number, but are earnest and zealous for the kingdom as in other parts of the field. During the year, the Society has established itself in better quarters in Kingston, and the work has made some progress. At least, those who are engaged in it have zealously put forth their best endeavors. From the local manager’s report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We are hereby sending our report for the little we were able to do in the Lord’s service during the year. Our prayers for you ascend daily, and we can truly say, “The joy of the Lord is our strength.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Words are inadequate to express the joy we receive as we joyfully declare the setting up of Messiah’s kingdom, the only remedy for all earth’s ills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During the year the brethren on the whole entered more fully into the service. Our Island being well canvassed, it takes more effort to put out the books; but even where no books are placed we give the testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Some who were once with us and went out from us tried to misrepresent us, but their slanders have no effect. The work still goes on, with increased loyalty and zeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During the year we had several service conventions, which enabled many of our readers to express their personal appreciation for the kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Our regional service director has been a great help to the classes. A few new classes have been formed, and the new brethren came in with much zeal, love and activity in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We are truly grateful to God for directing the Society to so arrange the work that every consecrated heart may show forth Jehovah’s praise. Aside from this arrangement we would all be inactive, holding forth no kingdom fruits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">May the God of eternal wisdom continue to supply our needs through the Society till we all appear in glory a called, chosen and faithful company.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark460"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark461"></a>JAPAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The agents of organized Christianity have worked for many years in Japan, but now their works avail nothing. Those who really have love for the Lord are beginning to receive the truth. The Lord has some people in Japan, and when these hear the message they gladly accept it and obey the Lord’s commandment by getting into the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work in Japan during the year has progressed splendidly in view of the conditions that exist there at the present time. There are 33 colporteurs and one auxiliary colporteur in the field. The following, which is extracted from the local manager’s report, will be read with keen interest by those in lands more favored by natural conditions:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The conditions in Japan are getting worse socially and financially. The ruling factors are entirely helpless to handle the situation. Tokyo, Osaka and other great cities are practically bankrupt. People refuse to pay taxes. Communists and anarchists are very active everywhere in Japan and Korea. People are greatly oppressed by the rulers. Some of the people are living on 3 sens (or 2j cents in American money).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In these miserable conditions the work of the Lord is progressing majestically, and more books are placed in the people's hands. We really see the miracles of the Lord here. Praise the Lord!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The result of the activities in Japan, from September 25, 1929, to September 24, 1930, is as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">There were 43 men and women who consecrated themselves during the last year. Many of them are very active in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. and Mrs. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Mikinan Kobayashi, tailors, were very active members of a church at Osaka. He had three employees at his store. Three months ago a woman colporteur called on </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Mr.  </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">at his store without knowing that he is a Christian. He took a set of booklets. A few days later this same colporteur was working in the same territory, and met him again. He told the colporteur that he was about to send an order for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Harp, Deliverance</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> to the Tokyo office. He exclaimed, '‘Why this is the truth which I was looking for!” He took all the books and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> At the first part of September he called his three employees before </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and told them, ‘‘*1 have decided myself to consecrate to the Lord’s service. I have no more interest in the tailor business. So I will close the store at once. If you wish to get other employment I will find it for you. And if you wish to return to your native place, I will be very glad to give you enough money. Which do you choose!” These three young men are also Christian, and were rejoicing in the truth. They said to the employer, ‘‘Why, there is no other way for us to go except to go into the Lord’s service. We will go just the same way you go.” Then the store dosed quickly. Now these people are working in the Lord’s joy in the assigned territories. Mr. and Mrs. Kobayashi have eight children. Eldest son, 18 years old, also is working as a colporteur. This is one of many examples to show how the ‘‘young men” see the Lord’s vision. Praise the Lord!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lord’s works are opposed by the Devil’s organization and the ‘‘evil servant” class, as usual, in Japan and Korea. But the enemies are entirely helpless before the glorious march of our </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">King.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark462"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark463"></a>KOREA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The work in Korea is also locally managed from the Japanese branch of the Society. There has been splendid progress in Korea also. The people are very poor, but many of them are anxious to have the truth. During the year 1,573 books and 2,561 booklets have been distributed amongst the people. The brethren in Korea are awakening to their privileges and pushing the work with all the power they can. The literature now in the Korean language consists of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp, Where Are the Dead? Comfort,</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Millions Now Living Will Never Die. Oppression, Judgment</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font5"> are translated and will soon be ready for the press.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark464"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark465"></a>NORTHERN EUROPEAN OFFICE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s Northern European office, located at Copenhagen, has the local management of the Society’s work in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Esthonia. The brethren have pushed forward with continued zeal and devotion to the Lord during the year. As a general summary of the work in these countries the following is taken from the report of the manager of the Northern European office to this office:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The most important event was, of course, the receipt of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> with its broad, simple and comprehensive treatment of Revelation. That it will give a tremendous impetus to the work is clearly shown by the following incident: At the Oslo convention several speakers gave their impressions in a session set apart for the purpose, and the brethren were enthused. Just afterwards, in September, I set out on a tour in Norway. When at Kristiama I received a message: “Tell Brother Dey that on Sunday the 7th in rainy weather we drew out from Skien in a big bus and 21 'locusts’ spread 637 books.” It is grand, Brother Rutherford, and while I saved a cable to you (for I was once Scotch), yet I thanked the Lord with grateful heart for this gift to his church, and rejoiced that you were used to pass it on. We shall do our utmost to get it translated quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">One sees more and more clearly what wonderful things Jehovah has prepared for his remnant and how they are being more entirely separated from and made independent of the Devil’s organization. By his arrangement we now dwell in our own properties in Oslo, Stockholm and Helsingfors, and this month we shall have our own printery in Helsingfors so that we may ourselves print our </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> We are thus enabled to serve the kingdom interests more effectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">As elsewhere, we feel the effects of the fight. One prominent brother has withdrawn because he cannot see the Elisha phase of the work. This will surely sift out all those who worship creatures rather than the Creator. The remnant, however, is sufficient for Jehovah’s purposes, and they delight to honor and serve him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In the year just ended 163,466 bound books have been sent out, as against 106,154 last year, but only 454,330 booklets instead of 1,045,773. However, on campaign booklets alone we were down by 594,336. The actual books and booklets placed were 639,768; viz., 155,783 books and 483,985 booklets. We rejoice in that though our numbers are poorer, yet we have been able to pay more to the Society towards the cost of printing than ever before. In Denmark and Norway alone over 2,400 sets of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Scripture Studies</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> were placed in the last November campaign. In the May week this year over 3,200 sets were placed; and of them, 85 sets were placed by one brother alone m Bergen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Everywhere the brethren are more clearly realizing the functioning</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">g of God’s organization and the need for obedience thereto. Not only has the organization method helped forward the work, but it also weeds out those who will not work in harmony therewith, who are lawless. The Special </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bulletin </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">has been translated and has proven of great value to the workers, while the &quot;Hundredfold” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> has brought home their responsibility to many and increased their desire to be whole-time in the work. Some have expressed their intention of entering the work this winter, and we hope to hear from still more. The Lord not only gives us light, but helps us to walk in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">This year 149 whole-time and auxiliary colporteurs spread</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">292,693, as against 450,363 last year by 147 workers. We are glad because this noble band continue faithfully in the light. The proportion of bound books was greater by over 50 percent, while the decrease in booklets is due to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Peoples Priend</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> booklet spread last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> continues to do a good work in Northern Europe, and the number of subscribers has increased by over 7,000, to 42,400. As we have been unable to get on over the radio, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> is specially useful in keeping us before the public and preparing the way for the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We have had more campaigns this year than ever before. In November, in a week we placed 24,410 bound books and 11,259 booklets, besides taking 208 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> subscriptions and placing 2,743 single copies. Thirteen hundred and seventy-five took part. In March we had another special week and placed 22,942 books and 13,553 booklets, besides taking 640 subscriptions and placing 5,439 single copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Twelve hundred and seventy-one took part. In May IBBA Week 1,362 took part and placed 10,728 books and 45,876 booklets, besides taking 249 subscriptions and placing 5,545 copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> In August we had a quickly arranged sympathy campaign in line with your extra July 1, and 925 placed in all 27,916. In our autumn IBSA Week 1,436 brethren took part and spread 10,738 books and 68,597 booklets, and took 338 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> subscriptions and placed 7,038 single copies; a grand total of 86,373. In all these special pushes the brethren enjoyed many evidences of Jehovah’s favor in the interesting and happy experiences that fell to their lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We always feel and say that the last conventions have been the very best ever, but these have been very marked by the Lord’s favor this year. That is because </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">articles were dealt with, and Jehovah became more exalted in the minds of his people. When he says, “Behold, my servant, whom I uphold: mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth,” he must cause his “servant” to feel the joy he has in them, and they in turn rejoice more in him. He visits his people in the pages of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and rich indeed are the feasts of fat things he spreads before them. They come to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads; they obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing have fled away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We had hoped for a visit this autumn, but now we know that yon were busy and you sent us </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> instead. We want aU the same to ask you now again for next year if it be at all possible. Our desires are not selfish, for we realize that the Lord, through you, visits and refreshes his people. In the result the work receives fresh impetus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is impossible to insert a full report of these separate offices, for want of space. However, we give a brief statement covering these countries.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark466"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark467"></a>DENMARK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In Denmark the total of books and booklets placed is less than last year, but that is due to the five-cent booklet, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend,</span><span class="font5"> put out last year. The net results, however, are better. There are more than double the number of bound books placed in the hands of the people. From the report of the local manager in D</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">enm</span><span class="font5">ark the following quotation is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">To Jehovah is due all honor, and I am happy to report that even here in far-away little Denmark there is a small band, a faithful remnant, who just love to fight for him and his Christ against Satan’s evil and hideous organization. We have never been many, and now we are even fewer, but the work goes on grandly, to the honor of his name, whom we love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan knows his geography. As small a country as Denmark is, he has found it on the map and reckoned it worth his while to come here and fight You know well with what result; and while we regret that one in line for the kingdom should withdraw and afterwards begin to assemble others around </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> yet we have neither time nor inclination to weep. We must press the battle to the gate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Some very foolishly thought that that would be the end of the Society’s work in Denmark. They did not realize that the work is the Lord’s. He must indeed be a fool who can say in his heart: There is no God; it is all the work of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In several of the small ecclesias some have been gathered out of the kingdom, but with the effect that the faithful remnant have Been their privileges more clearly and have gone forward with increased vigor and zeaL</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The outlook for the coming year is therefore the best. As you will see from the enclosed distribution report for the year, the grand total of books and booklets placed has gone down; but that is because of the many </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> placed last year. In books, there is a decidedly fine increase. Last year we sent out 14,954, and this year 33,935. That we have placed so many books is especially due to the fact that we have been able to place whole sets of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Studies</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> for the first time in the truth history in Denmark. We hope to be able soon to place the sets of the “rainbow” books, promising “Life” and “Light” to the people. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> is about translated, and we hope to get out the two wonderful </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">light </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">as soon as ever possible. It is only a pity I cannot tell you how much I appreciate these books. My joy knows no bounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We have not yet been able to get in on the radio, but we are keeping an eye on the State’s radio board, and will as soon as possible make a new attack. Tallinn radio, in Esthonia, however, can be heard in Denmark, and last time I gave a talk in Danish from that station it was translated into Esthonian, to make the best use of the opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">At Easter and Whitsuntide we had seven very enthusing and encouraging conventions in different parts of the country, and in August we had the big event, the annual general convention in Copenhagen. The spirit of the Lord rested upon us as we were gathered together to get new vigor and find ways and means to carry on the good work entrusted to the remnant. We had hoped to see you there, and it would have increased our joy; please remember that when you are laying your plans for next year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark468"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark469"></a>NORWAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The zeal of the Lord’s servant continues to be manifest in Norway, and the work goes grandly on. The following is quoted from the local manager’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">There are also here in Norway some few who are thankful and glad for being Jehovah’s witnesses. As before, we have also had some difficulties and some friends can’t see the bright light s</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">hinin</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">g and will not cooperate with us, but new friends are coming instead and enjoy going out with the truth to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Still, as many years before, the Norwegians are living in a difficult economic situation. They are for that reason also more friendly now when we come to them. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">also has prepared a good way for us. We now have 4,266 subscribers, and have placed 5,023 single copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">From the office we have sent out a total of 64,613 books and booklets, 49,457 free copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> tracts and folders, 3,888 Bulletins and 1,682 letters. One hundred thirty friends have been in the service work, and 9 colporteurs. Average number of workers out each week, 59.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We have just received </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and all of us who are able to read English are enjoying these wonderful truths. We shall be very glad to have them soon in Norwegian, so all the friends themselves can read them and go out to the people with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Bethel home is now moving to our own house in Inkognitogaten 28, b. We have to leave Parkveien 60, where we have lived since 1916. Glad to have our own house, where we can place everything as it suits ourselves. We did not get permission from the town authorities to build a new flat, but are just now getting in central-warm.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark470"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark471"></a>SWEDEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The outward evidences show a unity of the brethren in Sweden, and a healthy progress of the work that has not heretofore been realized. This is cause for much thanksgiving and praise to Jehovah God. The conditions may be well summed up in the following extracts from the report of the local manager</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Once again I have the honor and pleasure of sending you the annual report stating in figures what has been done by the Lord’s people in this part of the field. The Swedish brethren are happy in the realization of the fact of the oneness of the work and really appreciative of their privileges as part of our </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">King</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">’s army, marching through difficulties, and continually fighting toward the glorious victory. AH the more the fighting spirit has become manifest, and, although some are not so alive, the nucleus of the church in this country is very quickly responding to every call for special service, as well as constantly in the firing line. And how could it be otherwise with those who really love God J The wonderful things now being revealed to us through the pages of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and in the books must create in every one of the faithful a burning desire to magnify His holy name and fight for the honor of it. Surely he giveth “Light” on our pathway!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">As will be seen from the annexed figures we hare not reached last year’s mark in output of books. This is so </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mainly because we have had no “campaign” booklet, such as </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Peoples Friend,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> this year. The output of books as against booklets, however, is continually increasing. This year we put out from the office 49,032 books, as against 34,490 last year. Of booklets we put out 142,721; making a total output of 191,753.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During the year we have tried to follow the various drives you have had in America as closely as possible. All of these drives have been marked by success. In fact, some of the classes placed more books during those five weeks than they did during the remaining forty-seven of the year. And they were not idle during the forty-seven weeks either.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The colporteur work has proven to be the backbone of the work in this year as formerly. We have had an average number of 27 whole-time colporteurs and 21 auxiliaries in the field, the highest number of whole-timers at any one time being 34. The colporteurs and auxiliaries have placed a total number of 96,368 books and booklets and a goodly number of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> subscriptions. A party of two have used the motor car in the Society’s possession and worked in Lapland, the northernmost part of Sweden, where there is an abundance of miles and the population is very scarce. The brother in charge reports that during April-September they have traveled 7,050 miles and placed more than 2,000 books and 4,000 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The class work has had the new organization method in force during the year, for the first time, and to great advantage. The number of classes organized in this way is 58, and they, together with some isolated workers, have had an average of 209 workers out in the work every week, and their output amounted to 76,482 books and booklets, besides </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">subscriptions and single copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The recommendation in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> that service conventions be held in various parts from time to time has been followed out, as far as the conditions in this long and sparsely populated country have permitted, and we all agree that this arrangement is from the Lord and proving a great blessing. Brother Dey has been present at some of them, and seeing that he is now able to talk to the friends without an interpreter (in the &quot;Scandinavian” language but adapted to suit the different countries of Sweden, Norway and Denmark, with their somewhat different tongues), we anticipate his coming visits during a trip fixed for this autumn with still more joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The new fiscal year now opens with the introduction of the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">War or Peace, Which?</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> among the Swedish people, and we anticipate good results from this booklet, which will doubtless create among its readers an interest in the more detailed presentations of the truth in the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">And so we are joyfully marching along the pathway Binging the new song, shouting even, and blowing the trumpet with no uncertain sound. A clergyman of one of the &quot;free” congregations, as they call themselves, was stating to one of the colporteurs the other day: &quot;Can’t you understand how difficult it is for us to save souls where you are going with your books?” And we rejoice because it is so, and in the realization that soon none of them shall be able to obscure the truth and keep it from the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is also encouraging to see how the presentations in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> are holding true, in this country also, as to the development of an &quot;evil servant” class. Only the other day such a one was uttering vehement words of denunciation and threatening to one of the class workers here who called at his house without knowing who lived there. But we know that it is to the &quot;faithful and wise servant” the Lord’s promises of protection and grace unto final victory are given; and so on we go, rejoicing in the hope and in our glorious privileges of the present day.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark472"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark473"></a>FINLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Finland is a far-away country, and cold, but the small number of the Lord’s army there are hot and pushing the work to the Lord’s praise. There has been a decided increase in the output of bound and other literature in that land during the fiscal year. From the local manager’s report the following is taken.-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">One of the items of rejoicing has been the increasing output of big books. The year before we placed nearly 30,000, and now 40,000. The whole output of books placed has been 191,146, and together with the freely given tracts and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watch Tower,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> the total is 721,887 pieces. When all the difficulties are taken into consideration, it testifies a good work from the friends’ side. A very great help to attain this result has indeed been the new books we have received during the year, because our biggest and best classes are doing </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">zealous work, and without new books they had to go again and again over the same territory with the same books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A good push for the service work has been the many service conventions held during the year over the whole country. During the year 50 conventions have been held, at which 2,224 friends have been present, of which 1,395 participated in the service work, putting 12,788 books in the hands of the people. Fifty-six symbolized their consecration to the lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The erection of our own printing plant has also been a great stimulus for us. It has caused much enthusiasm among the friends. We are very grateful to you for the permission, and hope, when the plant is ready, in the beginning of our new year, to be able to do the work with greater zeal than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Although the list of subscribers for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> has gone down a little, from 1,704 to 1,606, because some more have been tired and left us, yet we who are left appreciate it still more. It has been so great a joy for us to have our own </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> studies at the office that we all joined in the remark of the members of the family: “We are already in heaven. To be at the studies now is much greater than we formerly thought being in heaven would be.” Did not Paul say that he “made us sit together in heavenly places”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(Eph. 2:6) It is indeed grand now to have the privilege of reading </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> And in this connection let me specially mention how much I appreciate the admonitions, made again and again, to do the service work. The work is just our job, and for that reason it is a great pleasure to hear about it often and m just the fine way </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> is doing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio lectures from the radio station in Tallinn have also been encouraging to us. The station is so near our country that it can be heard here very well. During the year I have had the privilege of broadcasting two Finnish lectures and one in Esperanto. The Esperanto lecture caused a good interest also in other countries. In our country it was received in some big halls and translated into Finnish for those who did not understand Esperanto. Both friends and foreigners showed great interest in the lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Yesterday I had an interesting experience. I spoke in our phone at our office. It was connected with the radio station in Ta</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">llinn</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">, which put the talk on the air. We have received information from different parts of our country stating that the reception was very good. Perhaps this will open a good way to spread the truth on a greater scale in our country.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark474"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark475"></a>LITHUANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">There is a great handicap to the work in the Baltic States, including Lithuania, but in spite of this the brethren press on with the work. There has been a decided increase during the year. The following extract is taken from the local manager’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A state of war still exists between this country and Poland. As mentioned in the report for last year, the country is under martial law and freedom is, to a large extent, curtailed. As in all countries where Roman Catholicism is the state religion, the power of the priests makes itself felt. Fanning is the chief occupation of the people, and the prices of farm products are so low that farmers are often unable to purchase necessities for the coming year. Rye, one of the chief crops of the country, was previously exported to Germany, but the raising of the tariff has created a glut on the market and the grain has reached as low a price as 1½ American cents per kilogram. When able to obtain employment, many laborers earn as little as fifty American cents a day, women receiving as little as thirty cents. A man earning a dollar a day has quite a good job. Apart from foodstuffs, commodities are as dear as in other lands. Difficulty is experienced in reaching the country people, who are busy in the fields during the summer. The state of the ground in spring and autumn almost prevents the work in some parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is pleasing to report that, despite these difficulties, there has been an increase of 88 percent in the distribution of bound books and 48 percent in that of booklets over last year’s figures, the totals being 1,773 and 10,714, respectively. We are encouraged as we realize the blessing of Jehovah on our efforts, and look forward to giving a better witness during the year ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In Memelgebiet, formerly a part of Germany, a few faithful brethren continue to sing forth the praises of Jehovah. Some have allowed their hands to slack, it is true, but those who appreciate the importance of their calling continue to give a good witness. Conditions in this district are as </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">difficult as in Lithuania proper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lord’s anointed here appreciate more than ever the importance of their commission and the honor of proc</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">laimin</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">g the name of Jehovah in this dark corner of Satan’s dominion. They unite in sending you assurance of their warm love and continued loyal cooperation.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark476"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark477"></a>LATVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Work in Latvia has been carried on during the year under a great handicap. The German colporteurs were expelled by the Government, and since then the work has been done by native brethren. The present government of Latvia was put in by the clergy, and these have done everything possible to suppress the truth. In spite of all these handicaps during the year, 33,162 books and booklets have been placed in the hands of the people. Two conventions were held during the year. These were marked with a real zeal for the Lord. The local manager, in his report, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Reviewing the work of the past year I am constrained to say, “It is good to be a servant of the Most High.” The workers in Latvia echo this sentiment We should very much like to have the many new books and booklets which the brethren in other lands have, yet we are happy here in the work of the Lord and look forward to the time when ‘the knowledge of the glory of God shall cover the whole earth as the waters cover the sea’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ESTHONIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;Wherever there is gross darkness upon the people it is difficult for the light to break through. The brethren devoted to the Lord, however, put forth their best endeavors, and the Lord blessed their efforts to get some testimony to the people who would hear. From the local manager’s report on Esthonia, the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In Esthonia, Northern Europe, the year closes with good news. We have just heard that our Sunday radio lectures broadcast from Tallinn are being heard well in Leningrad. So at last the truth is getting into Soviet Russia. Lectures are being given in English every Sunday, and are interpreted into Esthonian, German, Finnish, Swedish, or especially Russian. We thank our God and Father, Jehovah, that through his protection and providence the truth is being heard in places where as yet the books cannot penetrate.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark478"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Esthonia covers a bigger area than Belgium or Holland, but it has a population of only one million. Most of the people live on small farms widely scattered. Generally the roads are bad. When it rains heavily many of them are impassable. But in spite of this, the colporteurs have done valiantly, having placed over twenty thousand books and booklets. There has been an average of four working regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A few faithful women, together with the office staff, have placed over 2,300 pieces of literature, chiefly in T</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">allinn,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> the capital, a town of 130,000 population. There are twelve towns with populations of between twenty-seven hundred and three thousand. The university town of Tartu has fifty-seven thousand people. In several of these places there are those who are interested and appreciative.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark479"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark480"></a>PORTUGAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Not much progress has been made in Portugal during the year. Of course, it is not for us to judge the reason why, but it is well known that the people in Portugal know very little about the Scriptures and it is difficult to interest them in the Bible. That is true in practically all countries where Catholicism has had full sway. The work has progressed slightly in Portugal, even though the brethren there have put forth their very best endeavors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the past year 1,468 books and booklets have been placed in the hands of the people there. In addition, there have been 30,000 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> distributed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark481"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark482"></a>SPAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The work in Spain is carried on under very great difficulties. A few zealous brethren, however, continue to push forward, and during the year past 7,907 books and booklets were placed in the hands of the people. There are only two classes in Spain, and only one organized for service. There are 10 workers in the field. The following extract is taken from the local manager’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">There are many factors which impede the progress of the truth in this stronghold of Satan. For centuries the Catholic clergy have had dominion and kept the people in poverty and ignorance. They have caused laws to be passed whereby Protestants as such have absolutely no legal standing. There is much illiteracy, and the Bible is almost unknown. Owing to the rich natural resources of the country the people have not had a hard struggle for their existence, and consequently they are indolent and too lazy to read or study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Our colporteurs have been able to give the witness, and although they were frequently arrested and molested, they were able to continue, and this is surely due to the Lord’s care and protection. But a short tune ago the wife of a Protestant minister was put m jail for several months for having given away a tract. So we are grateful to the Lord and praise him for his overruling and protection on our behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is gratifying to report that a small beginning has been made in the service work. The brethren are seeing their privilege, and some are availing themselves of what opportunities they have of demonstrating their love and devotion to Jehovah. In many cases this means real personal risk and the danger of losing their employment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">On the whole, the outlook for the future is better. While we realize our own nothingness, we are confident in the Lord’s might and power and we have, as it were, cleared the decks for action and are looking to our Field Marshal to lead us on in the battle against Satan and his allies.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark483"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark484"></a>TRINIDAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The work in Trinidad, Port of Spain, continues to progress to the glory of the Lord. The money stringency in that country, like all others of the earth, makes it difficult for the poor to supply themselves with what they really need. This condition, however, the Lord overrules to cause them to look more earnestly for relief from God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year 2,453 class meetings were held, with an attendance of 2,550; 73 public meetings were held, with an attendance of 6,619. There were 172 workers in the field during the year, who placed in the hands of the people 10,958 bound volumes and 7,885 booklets. The local manager says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The brethren are in average good shape. Some manifest more zeal and earnestness than others, but all are determined to have some part in the work until the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Due to the world-wide stringency of money, we find it very difficult; yet these conditions make us see more clearly the necessity of pushing forward in the work for the relief of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has commanded that his anointed be witnesses to his work and name. Christ Jesus has declared that this gospel must now be preached. The faithful joyfully obey. The result of the year’s work is strong and persuasive proof that it is being done in harmony with the will of God. What more could we say ? Let his name have the praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Respectfully submitted.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark485"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark486"></a>YEAR TEXT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Jehovah preserveth all them who love him.” —Ps. 145:20, Roth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">J</span><span class="font7">EHOVAH’S rules are unchangeable and he is no respecter of persons. If a creature of God is to be preserved he must obey those rules. God is love, and ultimately life will be granted only to those who are in full harmony with God. Therefore love is the fulfilling of God’s law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The great issue before all intelligent creation is the word and name of Jehovah God. Testimony is now being given upon that issue, and the question at issue must soon be decided; and that decision will completely vindicate God’s word and name. Those who love God and prove it now will have the privilege of participating in his vindication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus Christ takes the lead of all creation in the championship of God’s word and name. This he does because he loves Jehovah. That means his unstinted devotion to the Most High. He has always loved righteousness and hated lawlessness. His chief mission on earth as a man was to bear testimony to the truth. His chief joy now is the vindication of his Father’s word and name, and this he is proceeding to do.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark487"></a><span class="font7">God’s organization, which is Zion, is now builded up and the children thereof are inside 161</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">the organization giving praise to God, as represented by her gates. To the remnant of Zion is committed the obligation and privilege of delivering the remaining testimony concerning Jehovah and his word. The motive to perform this work is love, meaning an unselfish devotion to God. No one can remain inside the gates of Zion now unless he loves God. That love will be proven by the creature’s unqualified praise of the Almighty Creator. Anyone now inside the gates who becomes offended at the Lord or his work, finds fault and complains, and refrains from giving joyful praise to Jehovah, will be quickly gathered out of Zion by the angels of the Lord. There is no preservation for such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The enemy Satan is very mad against the remnant. His cohorts join him in the attempt to destroy the remnant. This they cannot do as long as those of the remnant remain in the secret place of the Most High. Into God’s organization none of the enemy will now be permitted to enter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God’s judgment already written is: “The Lord preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy.” (Ps. 145:20) No one of the remnant will be able to stand in his own strength. He must be preserved by the Lord. The rule is that those who love God he will preserve. These will be ultimately victorious and be for ever with the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The text for the year is timely. The fight is on to the finish. The promise of the text applies particularly now. Henceforth let all the remnant keep in mind the text and its full meaning. To all who thus do, and who prove their love for God by diligently and joyfully keeping his commandments, Jehovah says: “I am with you.” That means everything!</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Thine is the kingdom, 0 Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all.—1 Chron. 29:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To be sure, the name and word of God stand above all things; but aside therefrom the greatest doctrine in the Bible is that of the kingdom of God. Without the ransom sacrifice there would be no possibility of everlasting life for man; and for that reason the ransom sacrifice is of greatest importance to man. Above this doctrine, however, stands the greater one, concerning the kingdom of God, because by and through his kingdom God will completely vindicate his word and name and show to all creation that he is the only true God, that his word is true and that his name is worthy of all praise. When this truth becomes thoroughly entrenched in the mind of the Christian he begins to realize what a marvelous privilege is his to be a witness to Jehovah’s word and name and to make known his kingdom.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. —1 John 1:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is the fountain of light and life. He made the heavens and the earth and gave the spirit of life to all of them that move and breathe. He made the mountains, weighed them in his balances, and set them forth as eternal monuments to his own majesty and for the wonder and admiration of his earthly creatures that love him. He made the sun to light the earth by day, and the moon and the stars to illuminate it at night. Each morning, and forever, he causes his beams of light to be lifted above the mountain peaks and to spread their arms across the heavens, bespeaking his unlimited power and infinite glory. Unseen is the Almighty Creator; yet he is manifest by his works. The space curtained by the outspread heavens of light is his tent. His clouds, like majestic chariots, ride above the mountains, reflecting his radiant splendor. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts, full of eyes before and behind.—Rev. 4:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These “four beasts” or living creatures are separate from Jehovah’s person, and therefore would not picture his inherent qualities or attributes. Jesus is “in the midst of the throne” with the Father and also in the midst of these four living ones. He is the first of God’s organization, and all other creatures therein operate around his throne. The four living creatures, or living ones, therefore represent the foursquareness or completeness of God’s organization. These are “full of eyes before and behind”, showing that those of God’s organization are ever on the alert, beholding his hand that they may do his will, hence are guided by divine wisdom. Every part of God’s organization is swift to obey his commandments, and every action prompted by love. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 57-59</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Shall evU befall a city, and the Lord hath not done it J—Amos 3: 6, R.V,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The calamity which befell Jerusalem was a great evil to the Jews; but it was right, and was administered justly as a punishment for their wrongdoing, and more particularly as a vindication of Jehovah’s name. The issue was then, and is now, between Jehovah and the adversary. Jehovah has not prevented Satan from carrying on his wicked ways and works, nor has he prevented the people from following Satan. Jehovah has from time to time brought calamities or disasters upon certain peoples that his name might not entirely perish from the sight of creation; and this he does for the good of creation. Therefore all the evil which God has caused to come upon creatures has been right and just, whether that evil be in the form of individual punishment or as a great calamity upon a people or peoples.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The manifold wisdom of God, according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord.—Eph. 3:10,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The anointed are now beginning to see that a “plan” or “scheme” is inconsistent with the Almighty God. The omnipotent Creator needs only to will that a thing shall be done and there is no further controversy and no worry about its accomplishment When God created the heavens and the earth he did not need to make a plan therefor. The infinite wisdom of Jehovah God, and his unlimited power, render wholly unnecessary a plan by him. It was his will that the creature man should be made, and the work was done. If we say that God first made a plan for all his works, such would indicate a limitation to his power and wisdom; and therefore we know that such conclusion is incorrect. There is no limitation to God’s power. His wisdom is perfect. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">For that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first.—2 Thess. 2:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The year A.D. 1914 came and many consecrated ones were disappointed in the fact that the kingdom did not at that time appear to be set up. From and after that time there was a “falling away” from the truth and its service. Such “falling away” was particularly marked from A.D. 1917 onward; and those who fell away and who were once associated with and supporters of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society have since then, together with others who have joined them, been opposing and do still oppose God’s witness work concerning his kingdom. They now oppose the work that the Society is doing and will have nothing to do with the preaching of “this gospel of the kingdom” and the declaring of the vengeance of God against Satan’s organization^ Thus the above prophecy is fulfilled.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 121:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some have held the foolish thought that because one has made a consecration he should hurry up and die as quickly as possible, even denying himself the necessary food and raiment This is the spirit of a very unsound mind. For this reason it is foolish to waste one’s energy in doing something that will not further the interests of the Lord’s kingdom. The conclusion was once reached and held by God’s people that Jehovah will provide protection to afford opportunity for one to develop a perfect character. We have learned of our error. It does seem reasonable, however, that the Lord would provide complete protection and keeping to afford one of his anointed opportunity to prove his fidelity and demonstrate his integrity toward God. That Jehovah has promised to do. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And 1 saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God.—Rev. 7:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The total number sealed is 144,000 and must of necessity include those who died in faith and waited for the resurrection. God’s sign of approval upon them is shown by his awakening them out of death, in 1918. The remnant on earth received the robe of righteousness and the place in the temple and were given a better appreciation of the kingdom; and their loving zeal therefor is proof of their sealing. All are “spiritual Israelites” because they are God’s chosen “nation” and their right to live is as spirit creatures. The fact that one is in the covenant by sacrifice would not make him eligible for the kingdom; he must be in the covenant for the kingdom and be wholly devoted to the Lord and then receive the Lord’s approval, symbolized by the seal. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 89</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 8: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God made Jesus “a little lower than the angels” as the greatest of all men, that he might be the Redeemer of man. The glory and honor here mentioned do not refer to that of perfect manhood in times of restitution, but do refer to the glory and honor which Jehovah eonfers upon The Christ. It is The Christ whom God makes his elect servant, and he puts his spirit upon him, and delights his soul in him. Jehovah stands alone and besides him there is none; he has appointed Christ his great servant, and graciously makes others members of the body of Christ; and to Christ he gives glory and honor, even the divine nature, which glory and honor he will not give to any other. The glory mentioned by the psalmist clearly means the glory of God’s man who stands for the honor of Jehovah’s name. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood, after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.—Rev. 12:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Quite a number of those claiming full consecration to the Lord were swept away by the flood, but the faithful remnant could not be swept away. This should be a complete warning to God’s people. It is only God’s organization that Satan is trying to injure and destroy. The others he has under either his control or his influence. The faithful remnant will not yield thereto. “By their fruits ye shall know them,” saith the Lord. “The fruit of the spirit is love.” That means that those who love God put self in the background and devote their all to the Lord and to his glory. Such bring forth the fruits of the kingdom, meaning a full and complete devotion to the kingdom and the serving of God’s truth to others. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 253 Afterward he &quot;brought me again unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward.—Ezek. 47:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to Revelation 22:1 the “river of water of life” is seen “proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb”. That shows that the river did not begin to proceed until after God had placed his Anointed One on his throne in Zion, in 1914, at the birth of the kingdom. It is more reasonable to conclude that this river of water began to flow after the Lord came to his temple. This is supported by Ezekiel’s prophecy. That water of life or truth, when it begins to flow and show forth the glory of God, continues to rise until it has filled the entire earth. (Ezek. 47:2-5) The kingdom has begun and the water of life is flowing for those who seek to quench their thirst thereat. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 255</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">In him was life; and the life was the light of men. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:line-through;">—John 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah sent his beloved Son into this world of darkness and he was “the Light of the world”. His lifeblood was poured out that men might see the light and live and that his Father’s name might be glorified. He was raised from the dead and brought life and immortality to light. Jehovah gave his word that his beloved Son would again come in power and glory, set up his kingdom, and afford all men the opportunity to see the light and to be restored and to live on earth; that then the name and word of Jehovah should be vindicated. That time is at hand. Christ is placed upon his throne, and he then comes to his temple in the brightness of his glory. His shining shall never be dimmed. In due time the light shall illuminate all the living, and the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah’s glory as the waters cover the sea. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 10</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Manifestly this is after the Lord comes to his temple and after “the garments of salvation” are provided for those who are brought into Zion. The “lukewarm” are now without raiment and do* not appreciate the fact that they are “naked”. (Rev. 3:18) They have not watched and have not been obedient. Those who do not watch continuously will be deceived by the platitudes of Satan’s prophets, captured and stripped naked, and caused to walk in the procession of Satan, and the enemy will “see his shame”. This admonition of the Lord is manifestly for the purpose of warning the anointed to be watchful and faithful to the very end. This is specially important at this time, when the opposing armies are gathering for the final conflict. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 53, 54</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This shows there were many in the invisible host and they were there at Jehovah’s direction to protect his servant. Some one was in charge of the horses and chariots of fire, and Elisha knew that according to God’s arrangement the angelic host was present and would exercise greater power than that which could be exercised by the enemy. It should be kept in mind that the Prophet Elisha was used to foreshadow things relating to God’s anointed people on the earth. Hence those now engaged in the Elisha work may take this to themselves as a promise of complete protection, and that Jehovah God is furnishing such protection, even though it is invisible to human eyes, and that this protection is to his anointed.

<p><span class="font5">This “wine-vineyard” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">{Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> is the special care of Jehovah because of its fruitfulness. It is the vineyard that bears the fruits of the kingdom, and therefore must. be composed of the true vine and his branches. There is a specific time in which the “vineyard of red wine” is made manifest. The time is definitely located by the words, “in that day.” “That day” marks the time forward from which the Lord Jesus is placed upon his throne by Jehovah, and therefore began with 1914. It is the day that Jehovah has made, and it is a time of rejoicing for the church. When Jesus appeared at the temple of God and began to gather the remnant unto himself, that marked the beginning of the time of joy, and hence the time for the beginning of the song. Then the remnant began to sing: “I will praise thee.” —Ps. 118: 21. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“Babes” are those who are otherwise called “little children”. These endearing terms the Lord applies to such as are joyfully obedient to his will. They are the children of God, brought forth and anointed by him, and gladly humble themselves under his mighty hand. They delight to do his will, and if they thus continue, he will in his due time exalt them to a place of glory in his kingdom. Jesus on an occasion declared that “of such is the kingdom of heaven”. (Matt. 19:14) It is plain from the Scriptures that the humble ones, those who joyfully submit themselves to God’s way and will in carrying on his work, and who faithfully continue so to the end, are the ones who will be in the kingdom of God. It is such who are now singing forth his praises in the earth. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/30</span></p>

It was Mount Zion, which is symbolic of God’s pure and holy organization and of the kingdom born out of that organization, the Governor of which is pure, holy, and undefiled. He is Christ the Lamb of God. The fact that John saw Mount Zion is proof that the kingdom was born before the servant class, whom John represents, saw and appreciated it. The kingdom was born in 1914; but the fact thereof was not understood by the servant class until some years afterward. Hence the Lord was at his temple and Zion was built up before his faithful people on earth understood it. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 301</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This is in the nature of a prayer in the heart of every one of God’s organization, all of whom long for the time when God will wholly destroy the enemy and vindicate his name. Since God’s anointed witnesses on earth have discerned that Satan’s organization is made up of the commercial, political and religious combine that acts as Satan’s visible representative, and that ‘horns’, maltreats and oppresses the people, they pray that this wicked combination might be destroyed and the people released that they might praise and serve Jehovah God. Because Satan’s organization and those under his control oppose the message of truth, the angel of the Lord (Rev. 14:18) cries aloud for the remnant on earth to be more earnest and zealous in giving the witness of what is about to come to pass. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 340, 341</span></p>

A specific part or operation thereof is set apart to be exclusively used and wholly devoted to the help, comfort and instruction of Christ’s disciples, and this helper is called the holy spirit. It is not all the power of God, but is from him and is therefore God’s power. Being from God and being devoted specifically to one thing it is given a name, to wit, helper or holy spirit. In his absence Jesus would not be employed with every detail concerning the life and affairs of the church; but the holy spirit, sent forth in his name, and coming in contact with those who had the desire to be in harmony with God, would have to do with these details of directing and aiding the church. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/30</span></p>

Recognizing that they are privileged by his grace to be a part of his “servant”, and therefore have prospects of a part in the glorious work both present and future, they are overwhelmed by this honor and favor. The knowledge of the Lord, and his spirit upon them, enables them to take a proper view of themselves and to humble themselves under God’s mighty hand; and with great gladness of heart they go on in obedience to his commandments to give the witness to his name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/30</span></p>

Satan has been cast out of the heaven; and, the saints on earth being the only ones that he could possibly hurt, this wall symbolically says that as long as they abide faithful in God’s organization they are safe. The wall makes the city unscalable and unconquerable. It is the city of everlasting peace. Therefore those that dwell in it dwell in peace and safety. “For I, saith the Lord, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.” (Zech. 2:5) ‘Salvation hath God appointed for walls and bulwarks.’ (Isa. 26:1) These walls and gates indicate salvation to God’s people and that they are devoted to his praise. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 240, 241</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">On coming to his temple Jesus is accompanied by his angels. (Matt. 25:31) Then begins the work of the Lord of gathering together unto himself those who shall compose the temple class. This conclusion is supported by Jesus’ words: “And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet; and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.” (Matt. 24:31) These gathered and approved ones he brings under the robe of righteousness. It seems entirely certain that the Apostle Paul’s words above refer to this same time. Without a question of doubt this work of gathering to the Lord of the approved ones and of separating the professed ones began with the Lord’s coming to his temple; and it seems that this work is yet in progress, and is not entirely finished.

<p><span class="font5">The members of Zion cannot and do not keep still. They eannot, because “in his temple doth every one speak of his glory”. Being in the temple, they must sing forth Jehovah’s praise. Where there are those who claim to be followers of Christ and who are using the soft pedal concerning Satan’s organization, or who insist on keeping still and ignoring the fact that Satan has an organization, such is conclusive proof that they are not of Zion, whatever else might be their position. Let no one who has entered into a covenant with the Lord be deceived into remaining quiet and inactive.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s judgments are his judicial determinations set down in his Word that his children might read and understand them before they fall upon the evildoers. He directs his children to serve notice thereof upon others, that they too may have an opportunity to know. From the beginning God knew what would come to pass, and therefore he caused his judgments to be written; and these judgments are not understandable until his due time, which is now. He declares that he will bind the ruling powers of the wicked world and destroy that wicked organization, and in the execution of these judgments written all his saints shall have a part. The part thereof to be performed by his faithful children now on earth is to tell others of God’s purposes and judgments and to be witnesses to his majesty, power and glory. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 10</span></p>

Is there a God beside me?” (Isa. 44:8) He sends forth his anointed to give testimony of this fact, and this is bearing the fruit of the kingdom by telling the people how the blessings will come to them. Many have made a covenant to do the will of God and all such are begotten of Jehovah and are called to the kingdom. The greater number have either failed or refused to respond to the call. They do not present themselves a living sacrifice unto God. A small number do respond to and accept the call and go forth with a zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house, showing forth their devotion to Jehovah.

<p><span class="font5">How had Jesus brought honor and glory to the name of Jehovah God? Manifestly by his faithfulness and unswerving devotion to God under the greatest of all tests. He had been put to the test in that Satan had used every possible means to cause Jesus to be unfaithful to his covenant with God; but Satan had failed. Jesus had maintained his integrity under the test, and now he was about to be put to the final and crucial test. That test came, and he willingly went to death, and won. Because of his fidelity to Jehovah he had proven Jehovah’s word and name to be right and honorable. Therefore Jehovah gave to him the kingdom. In like maimer must Jesus’ body members, taken into the covenant for the kingdom, bring honor to the name of Jehovah.

Now he is the divine Bread of life, and, being divine, is therefore hidden from human eyes. Hence the description, “the hidden manna.” He is the divinely provided One upon whom the remnant now feed while in the wilderness condition, and this One is hidden from those who do not love God. This fact he now reveals to his remnant by his spirit and by his Father’s lightnings. “Manna” literally means “What is it?” Many claiming to be Christ’s followers do not understand the meat and drink now being enjoyed by the remnant and ask: “What is it?” It is only the remnant who see “present truth” and rejoice in it.

Turn us again, O Lord God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.” God heard the prayer of his faithful people and gathered together his remnant into the temple. These collectively are now designated as the “wine-vineyard”. These have full assurance from Jehovah that regardless of the vicious assaults made by the enemy upon those of his vineyard he will provide and has provided all necessary protection and care for them. Such is proof that the “wine-vineyard” is that part of God’s organization on earth which faithfully serves him. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15/30</span></p>

This work he began in 1914, when he was placed on the throne; and, coming to his temple, he invites his faithful followers to enter into his joy. To those who now walk in the light and delight to obey God’s commandments he unfolds his purposes. They see that soon Jehovah’s name will be vindicated, and they sing unto the Lord a new song, and his praises to the end of the earth. The destruction of hypocrisy, the complete overthrow of Satan’s wicked organization, and the clear revelation of truth and the shining forth thereof in God’s kingdom in the earth, will be the vindication of his name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 115</span></p>

The opening of that day began with 1918, when the Lord came to his temple, and it continues to shine until the exodus of the “servant” class into complete and everlasting glory. When those of the servant class on earth have finished the work which Jehovah has given them to do while in the flesh, and being faithful unto the end, they will enter into the perfect, glorious day. After the Lord came to his temple and the servant class was made up, those on earth had a better understanding of the pathway of life than previously. Such see now that their entrance into heavenly glory depends upon faithful devotion to God and an earnest and joyful performance of the covenant into which God has invited them.

(Luke 14: 26) When female influence, whether it be that of wife, sweetheart, mother, or sister, causes a man to deviate from faithfulness and whole-hearted service to the Lord, that influence not only is wrong but will lead to destruction. The Lord likens such unto the wrongful influence exercised by Jezebel over King Ahab which led to her destruction and to his. The true rule is that where the Lord places a man in a position to serve Him he cannot please the Lord and deviate therefrom one jot or tittle by being influenced by any other creature, and particularly by a female. The greatest privilege that can be given to a man is to serve God and his Christ and to maintain his integrity. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 30-33</span></p>

The approved ones the angels gather together, in this, that they are taken out from amongst those in the covenant who have become unfaithful to the Lord and who do not carry out their part of the covenant.

An agency used by the Lord to help his people need not be a living creature, but God could well employ some other agency through which to accomplish his will.

All the spirit-begotten, or spiritual Israelites, from which the ‘elect servant’ is to be taken, are in the covenant with Jehovah by the sacrifice of the antitypical “Lamb of God”, The 144,000 are faithful to the covenant and therefore receive the seal of approval. To the faithful remnant God gives a better appreciation of that covenant, and as a sign of his approval of them God brings them under the robe of righteousness, gives them the garments of salvation and the wedding garments, and thus identifies them with his official organization.

<p><span class="font5">In 1919 God’s people, being released from Babylon’s power that they might continue in the Lord’s service, and being brought under the garments of salvation, had received “the robe of righteousness” and entered into “the secret place of the Most High”, and therefore had occasion to begin the song to the glory of God. This doubtless marks the beginning of the song of the Hallelujah chorus. The multitude of singers would include the risen saints and the remnant on earth, which latter class is ‘seated in heavenly places’, and would include also all the angels of the Lord, and therefore all of God’s holy organization. The song must pertain to the time of deliverance of God’s people from the enemy. “Alleluia” means “Praise ye Jehovah”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 145</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Thus saith the Lord, . . . Where</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">the house that ye build unto met and where is the place of my rest!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 66:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord’s coming and the gathering together unto him of his faithful followers dates from 1918. From that time particularly disobedience to the Lord began to be manifested by those who professed to be in the covenant with him. They attempt to build a house and an organization different from God’s organization, and therefore God says the above words </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font5"> them. He tells them he is building his own house and that he looks with approval, not on the efforts of opposers, but upon his own people who are poor in their own sight, of a contrite spirit, and who are joyfully obedient to God’s Word. Those of God’s organization on earth love him; those who oppose God and his organization love themselves. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I will bless Jehovah who hath counselled me, yea! in the dark night have mine impulses admonished me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 16:7, Roth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The dark night” may refer to the opposition against the Lord’s “servant” class, which at times makes it seem almost impossible to go on with the Lord’s work. The agencies employed by Satan slander the work and cause the arrest of the workers, and conditions about them at times are dark. But those who have the spirit of the Lord are joyfully moved, even by their impulses, to press on amidst the darkest conditions and the greatest opposition. There are seasons when those of the servant class are almost overwhelmed by the adverse conditions; and yet, remembering their blessed position in the Lord’s, army, the Lord’s spirit moves them to continue joyfully in action. Jesus, amidst great opposition, pressed on. His body members, being of the servant class, must do likewise. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15/30</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The kingdom of God shall he taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Matt. 21: 43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus here laid down the rule that no one will be of that new nation, constituting the royal house or kingdom of God, except he bring forth the fruits of the kingdom. What is meant by the fruits of the kingdom ? Briefly, the answer is this: The life-giving and sustaining message of truth of and concerning the kingdom of God. Natural fruits grow upon a tree or vine. A tree denotes or symbolically stands for a living creature. A vine symbolizes the same thing. If that tree or vine is good, then it symbolizes one who delights to obey God’s law. The saints of God begotten and anointed by him are symbolized by trees of righteousness: “called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.” The fruitful trees are those that praise the Lord.—Ps. 148:7, 9.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea.—Rev. 13:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">John standing upon the sand of the sea fitly represents the servant or anointed class standing in a place of security and gaining a view of Satan and his works. The sands mark the impassable bounds of the sea, and hence a place of safety for one to stand: “Fear ye not me? saith the Lord: will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea, by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it; and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?” {Jer. 5:22) Thus is disclosed the fact that those who stand safe in the Lord would be the first ones to discern and make known the beast or hideous organization of Satan and to warn the people to flee from it. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 256</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">But God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit. —1 Cor. 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God has put many forces into action or operation that are invisible to man, and that are powerful, such as electricity, or electrons, or vibrations, and these are used for man and for man’s benefit. This, in a measure, may be used as an illustration of the holy spirit. The holy spirit operates specifically in relation to the bringing forth, development and use of the new creation for the kingdom of God. The holy spirit is therefore that power of God employed by him to give revelation of an understanding of himself and his purposes to those whom he brings forth as his sons. That power thus employed as a means of communication, revelation and help for his begotten ones, being blameless and perfect and complete, it, the agency used, is holy, and hence properly called “the holy spirit ’ ’. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I must proclaim the glad tidings of the kingdom of God to other cities also; because for this I have been sent.—Luke 4: 43, Diag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus Christ as a man was the greatest creature ever on earth. He is the greatest of all creatures. At the Jordan God brought him forth as a spirit creature and accepted and acknowledged him as his beloved Son. Jesus devoted himself to &lt;the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom of God because God had commissioned him to do that very thing. To his disciples he confessed that he must so do. It was not a mere whim of his to preach the glad tidings, but was an obligation laid upon him by reason of the covenant God had made with him for the kingdom. All his disciples or followers are called to follow in his footsteps. (1 Pet. 2: 21) Therefore Jesus sent his disciples forth to do the same thing that he did, and all who are pleasing to God must do likewise. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/30</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun.—Rev. 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That woman represents God’s organization, otherwise named Zion. Jehovah God is her “husband” and he accepts her as his wife because he has made her fruitful and he acknowledges her child by ‘catching it up to heaven’ at its birth. “For thy Maker is thine husband.” (Isa, 54; 5) God’s organization, symbolized by the pure woman, is partially visible to man, but the greater part thereof is invisible to man. It includes his beloved Son and all the host of heavenly creatures in harmony with God, and it includes those on earth who are faithful and true to God. The latter are the only part that is visible to human eyes, but these are the ones who are in real danger, by reason of the enmity of Satan against God and against his organization and the children thereof. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 232</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 8:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The speaker is God’s anointed, and therefore he must represent and speak for God’s anointed who are on earth at the time when Jehovah is exalted in Zion. His words could not mean that Jehovah’s name is exalted throughout all the earth among all peoples. Such has never been true up to the present time. But considering the fact that it is God’s anointed that speaks, it appears that the words must be considered as an exclamation uttered by the anointed and called forth by the fact that Jehovah has now made his name known to his people who are situated in various parts of the earth. This harmonizes with Isaiah’s words; “And in that day shall ye say, Praise the Lord, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.”—Isa. 12:4.

<p><span class="font5">The time has arrived to announce the fall of Babylon. Babylon is Satan’s complete organization, with Satan the husband and head thereof. It includes the invisible as well as the visible part thereof. It is Satan’s heaven and earth. Christ, the great Melehizedek Pnest, began in 1914 the assault on the head and against the entire organization of Babylon, and there resulted a great fall, even a lightning-like fall to the earth; and henceforth Satan and all of his organization are confined in the operation thereof to the earth, and preparations for the great battle of the day of God Almighty proceed. At that battle the complete fall and everlasting destruction of Babylon will result. Her “burning” (Rev. 18:18) is therefore yet future. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Li I, 317, 318</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—John 1:51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From 1922 forward there has been a work done by the church the like of which was never done before. It could hardly be said that sueh witness work was brought about in the same manner that the disciples were directed to send messengers to their brethren at Antioeh. (Acts 15:22-28) Rather the Lord Jesus Christ, the Head of the “servant”, acting by and through his holy angels, has directed and is directing that work. It was the holy spirit that operated upon the minds of men in the early church to take certain action; but now the Lord Jesus himself has returned, is in his temple, and, acting by and through his holy angels, puts it into the mind and heart of the remnant class to take positive aetion and to do a certain work, especially since 1922.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life. —Deut. 4:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The heart is the seat of motive, otherwise called the seat of love. When one accepts the call for the kingdom by responding to that call, the issue is then life or death with such a one. It is written: “Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.’’ (Prov. 4:23) God has not called any to the kingdom merely to get jhem into heaven; but he has called them that they might show forth his praises. If the called ones are chiefly concerned about their own selfish interests and are not devoted to God they open themselves to the assaults of the Devil and easily fall. No one can be saved and taken into the kingdom who has not received the love of the truth. Receiving the truth and failing to use it to the honor of the Lord leads to perdition.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Rev. 10:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The knowledge and heavenly wisdom received from feeding on God’s revealed purposes disclose to the faithful ones that they are commissioned to go forth as God’s witnesses. They come to know what Satan has been doing and is doing by his agencies, and this causes them to be righteously indignant. (Jer. 15:17) The bitter indignation, however, does not at all take away the sweetness and joy of serving the Lord. Going forth as God’s witnesses in obedience to the Lord’s commandments has brought bitter trials upon them; but in such tribulation they rejoice, because such is an evidence or proof of God’s approval. (Rom. 5:3-5) These rejoice to have a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name under any and all conditions that the Lord is pleased to have to come to pass. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I,184,185</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">All men are sinners by nature; hence the expression “man of sin” must refer to something more than ordinary sin and for which the blood of Christ does not make atonement. Hence it is a sin unto death (1 John 5:16); the sin against the holy spirit (Matt. 12:31, 32) ; the sin not openly manifest at the beginning, but coming to the surface afterward (1 Tim. 5:22, 24, 25); a sin of respecting the persons of leaders (Jas. 2:9); and otherwise designated “the greater sin ” (John 10:11); the sin of forbidding the speaking of God’s message now and to the Gentile nations (1 Thess. 2:16); a sin committed by those once enlightened and who draw back unto perdition. (Heb. 10:39) There could be no worse sinners than those who were once enlightened and called and who responded to the call and then draw back and rebel against God and his kingdom. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Satan’s ruling agents have sought after the things of this earth that give riches and power, and the hypocritical religionists have helped to hold the devilish and oppressive organization together and to keep the people in ignorance of Jehovah’s provision for man. The destruction of the wicked organization and the relieving of the people from oppression and bringing to them a knowledge of God’s provision for them will be a vindication of Jehovah’s great and holy name and will completely prove that his word is true. Satan’s organization, and particularly the visible ruling factors thereof, have used all these fruits of the earth for selfish purposes.

<p><span class="font5">The angel proclaimed the message “with a loud voice”, suggesting that God’s servant class on earth must make a wide proclamation thereof. The ‘sea beast’ and his image are still in existence and operating at full time and speed in. the earth, and millions of the people are being oppressed. If one mentally or actively takes a stand on the side of Satan’s organization, represented in the “beast”, he thereby shows he is against Jehovah God. He is not for Christ and God; therefore he is against the Lord and his kingdom. Those who in any wise support Satan’s organization; actively or passively, are responsible for their course of action and thereby bear his mark either in the forehead or in the hand. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt 1, 328</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Understanding that “the day of Christ” began when Jesus came to the temple of God, in 1918, it appears that the rebellion must precede that day. The beginning of the “falling away” or rebellion against God’s organization would also mark the beginning of the disclosure of “the man of sin”. For some years now the faithful have seen the manifestation of lawlessness and now begin to discern the meaning of the term &quot;the man of sin”. The rebellion or “falling away” reached a culminating point in 1917. Thereafter the Lord Jesus began to gather together unto himself all those whom he found faithful, and these he invited to enter into his joy, and he increased their opportunities for service. However* Satan, cast out of heaven and to the earth, enters into “that wicked”, “the man </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">sin,” as he did into Judas. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Those of the vineyard sing the song to each other because God’s wine vineyard has come to maturity. (Eph. 4:13) A wine vineyard is a cause for raising a song of joy. The Lord Jesus has now returned and gathered together unto himself his faithful remnant, and with these he is drinking anew ‘the wine of the kingdom’, which is the joy of the kingdom. He has invited them to enter into his joy, and the wine of the vineyard is symbolic of that joy. This is the fruitful vineyard, and all those who are a part of it must bear the kingdom fruits to others. They sing to each other and call each other’s attention to the blessings of the kingdom, to the honor and glory of Jehovah’s name, and they sing unto the honor and glory of Jehovah God.

<p><span class="font5">Jesus warned his disciples against false Christs, and such warning is particularly for the benefit of those on earth at the end of the world. “Antichrist” means anything that is against Christ. There have been many such during the Christian era. (1 John 2:18) However, Paul indicates that there will be those who have been associated with the Lord’s people and who will form an antichrist at the end of the world. A “false Christ” is one falsely claiming to be the anointed one of God; he is also an antichrist because opposed to the true Christ. According to Jesus’ words the false Christs would appear after the coming of the Lord to his temple. The Apostle Paul discloses that those in the “falling away” will organise or be organized by Satan and fulfil the place of a false Christ.

<p><span class="font5">“Stone,” as here used, is from the word meaning “election” or “privilege to vote”. The Lord gives his vote for the approved ones. This seems to correspond with his confessing the names of sueh approved ones before his angels. This may also identify such a one as an approved member of the Lord’s organization. And the approved one receives “a new name”, thus indicating a confidential relationship with the Lord which no man can infringe upon or even know. Here his promise is to establish a close and confidential relationship between the approved ones and himself, and all the opposition that might be brought against them could not in any way infringe upon their good name with the Lord.

<p><span class="font5">Followers of Christ, by reason of the covenant of sacrifice, are appointed unto death. Life everlasting of such depends upon faithfulness unto God and the holding stedfastly of their integrity. Satan and his agents continually assault such followers of Christ Jesus in an attempt to turn them away from God and cause their destruction and to ridicule Jehovah. To the world, which is under Satan’s rule, these followers of Christ are foolish fanatics and the very off-scouring of men; to the evil angels and men, they are fools. As proof of this the apostle says: “We are fools for Christ’s sake.” That is to say, Because we hold fast to Christ as our Redeemer, Lord and Master, we are fools in the sight of the world and evil angels and of men who do not believe God. Thus we learn to obey God’s will under test. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The light of God shines upon and about them that love and serve him. Those of God’s organization on earth are sure of God’s light and favor both day and night, which is symbolized by the sun and moon. The ‘twelve stars upon the woman’s head’ symbolically says: ‘She is a heavenly queen and fit therefore to bring forth the offspring of Jehovah, her husband, the King of eternity.’ Being with child and about to be delivered she cried out. Her cries were those of pain directed to Jehovah God, the only One who could help her. Her cries are prayers for God’s kingdom to begin. Clearly the lesson taught by this is that the kingdom is not produced except at great cost of pain and suffering on the part of those who are members of God’s organization.—Acts 14:22. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 233</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">One in Christ and then failing or refusing to bring forth or bear the fruits of the kingdom is taken away and destroyed. This does not mean that such fall back into the “great multitude” class. For anyone in the covenant for the kingdom there is no alternative: he must prove faithful if permitted to abide in the vine and ultimately to be of the kingdom in glory. No greater emphasis could be laid upon the vital importance of bringing forth or bearing the fruit. Jesus would be keenly interested in telling his disciples what was necessary for them to fulfil their covenant for the kingdom. That which Jesus stressed was the importance to the disciples of bringing forth fruit that the name of Jehovah might be glorified. He was not telling them of what they must do to glorify themselves.

He will realize that the creature is not as much as the small dust in the balance when compared with the great Creator. His helplessness and complete dependence upon the Lord God is ever before him. As his knowledge of the loving-kindness of God increases he has a greater desire to worship Jehovah, and a greater measure of devotion to him. He delights to put himself in the proper physical attitude showing his dependence upon Jehovah. His motive then in so doing is entirely unselfish. He thus naturally assumes that attitude which best befits his relationship to God. If alone, he delights to bow down in silent prayer. If with his brethren, he will be glad to kneel with them in prayer. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">~W 8/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The chief officer of Jehovah’s organization is Christ Jesus. In his organization are myriads of angels invisible to human eyes. Also therein are the faithful body members of Christ now resurrected and the anointed remnant now on earth. Since it is God’s organization, the word “heaven” properly applies to any part thereof. Any member of the organization assigned to any duty or work, and performing such, is a deputy or messenger (angel) of the Lord. Christ’s body members on earth, composing the remnant, and therefore forming a part of the elect servant, appear in the capacity of ambassadors or angels by reason of acting under the direction of the Head Christ Jesus, in performing his work. Therefore the words “heaven” and “angels” at times properly apply to the earthly division of God’s organization. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 98</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Manifestly the purpose of warning the church concerning “the man of sin” was and is to fortify the faithful against loosely holding to or handling the truth. The psalmist describes God’s ideal “man”. (Pss. 1, 8, 16, 112, 119) The Prophet Isaiah (42:1-6, 19, 20) refers to God’s ideal man as “my servant”, “mine elect.” The Christ is one, and in the Scriptures is spoken of as “a perfect man”. (Eph. 4:13) The Scriptures also disclose that at the end of the world there will be manifest an “evil servant” which is the very opposite of Jehovah’s ‘elect servant’ and which evil servant opposes God’s elect servant. God’s Word seems fully to support the conclusion that “the man of sin”, “the son of perdition,” is the “evil servant”. Let all the faithful be of good courage. The enemy and all his powers cannot succeed. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.—Rev. 5:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus is the Just One, and therefore called “the Lion of the tribe of Juda”. He is the chief one giving praise to Jehovah’s name, therefore he is “of Juda”. He is “the Root of David” because he makes the royal family grow into a kingdom and he is the inheritor of the “everlasting covenant . . . , even the sure mercies of David”. (Isa. 55:3; 11:10) The breaking of the seven seals entails upon the one doing it the carrying out of that of God’s purposes which is exposed to view. Christ the King is doing this by causing a great witness to be given in the earth to the name of Jehovah God. To Christ has been committed the work of this testimony, and he in turn has committed a part thereof to the remnant and they are privileged to join him in this glorious work. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I,64 Then sang Moses . . . this song unto the Lord, and spake, ■saying, I iviU sing unto the Lord.—Ex. 15:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is the special privilege and duty of the remnant to sing just preceding the execution of God’s judgment. The song they now sing is not one of “restitution”, but a song denoting that these see the great victory God<sub>(</sub> will get over the enemy. Moses was a faithful servant in the Lord’s house .“for a testimony”. (Heb. 3:5) That means that Moses as a servant foreshadowed the great elect servant of Jehovah composed of Christ Jesus and the members of his body. The song of Moses at the Red Sea followed the overthrow of Pharaoh and prophetically spoke of God’s judgment upon Satan and of the overthrow of Satan’s organization, and the song of praise that follows such victory. By faith the remnant see the victory now, and they sing. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah delights in his “servant’’because that servant has the spirit of his Father and is entirely devoted to the Most High. For this reason the servant is holy. With full confidence he looks up into his Father’s face and reverentially says: “Jehovah, my Sovereign Lord art thou.” Such is another way of saying: ‘Jehovah, I am at thy disposal; whatsoever is thy will concerning me, that I shall delight to do.’ The “servant” is Christ Jesus and the members of his body, because the body members are anointed of the Father through Christ the Head. He declares his relationship to Jehovah. He is the willing servant of Jehovah and recognizes that he has no well-being without Jehovah or apart from </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5"> and he does not desire any other. He lives for the glory and honor and service of Jehovah and for the good of the people who love God. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">When Jesus was with his disciples he was a comforter to them. He was more than that. He was their teacher, guide, helper, exhorter, and the constant stimulator of their lives. Jesus was about to go away, and before going he was giving instruction to his disciples for their aid and comfort. The word “comforter” is hardly adequate to convey the full meaning of what Jesus said. The demonstration of the holy spirit during the absence of Jesus was not limited to comfort or consolation, but was also employed to give energy and discipline, to make intercession for and in behalf of his disciples, and to shield and protect them, and to guide them. It was also a means of revelation and the giving to them of understanding. It has been with them “to the age” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Diag.)</span><span class="font5"> or “age-abidingly”.—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.</span><span class="font5"> W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And he that is righteous, let him do righteousness still. —Rev. 22:11, Roth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No human creature is righteous within himself. When one trusts in Christ’s redemptive blood and makes a consecration to do God’s will, and God receives him and justifies him, he is then counted as righteous. If he is ever to live on any plane, he must maintain that righteousness accounted unto him by reason of the blood of Christ and God’s judicial determination. He can maintain it only by holding to the faith once delivered to the saints. Those designated above as righteous have not been chosen for membership in the kingdom and have never been anointed by Jehovah. They have been brought forth as his children, and because they love righteousness and because they cry unto the Lord for help he saves them out of their distress.—Rev. 7:14. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 272, 273</span></p>

These anointed ones will see eye to eye, that is, they will understand the great fundamental truths and the will of God concerning his people, and will act harmoniously. The Scriptures refer to Zion, or the house of God, also under the term Jerusalem. It is written in God’s Word, and which applies now to his anointed ones: “Our feet shall stand within thy gates, 0 Jerusalem. Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together.” The feet members of God’s organization must, and now will, stand together, having and manifesting the unity in Christ, and each one will seek the welfare of God’s organization.

<p><span class="font5">One may well imagine that he is being invited to look into the most gorgeous and glorious temple that could exist. He beholds a throne set in heaven; it is the throne of Jehovah the Most High. The One upon the throne is not pictured as like a son of man, but as like the most precious gem stone, glorious in reflection of light, transparently pure and inflexible in righteousness. It is God’s house, and he is the glory thereof and is that which would first be seen therein. The beauty and glory of the eternal King began to dawn upon those of the remnant only after the temple in heaven was opened to their vision. No man had anything to do with opening this temple nor with giving to God’s creatures a vision thereof. It all came by the grace of God through Christ Jesus his beloved One. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 54, 55</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The nation of Israel fell because it did not bring forth the fruits of God’s kingdom. “Organized Christianity” has failed because it has brought forth no fruits of the kingdom, but, on the contrary, has brought forth a death-dealing corrupt fruit of Satan’s organization. All human schemes are contrary to God’s kingdom and therefore corrupt. During the past fifty years many who have agreed to do God’s will have failed to bring forth any fruits of the kingdom, and because of this have been turned aside and become members of the “evil servant” class. Those who are wholly devoted to God and who are diligent in proclaiming the message of his kingdom and testifying to his glory and his works are bringing forth the kingdom fruits.

<p><span class="font5">The lukewarm, though thinking they are rich, are in fact poor, because they do not know the value of true riches which they do not possess. No one in this day can be Tich in the Lord who tries to avoid the reproach of Christ. ‘The reproach of Christ is greater riches than all the treasures of the world.’ (Heb. 11:26) “A good name [with Jehovah] is rather to be chosen than great riches [of the world], and loving favour [with God] rather than silver and gold.” (Prov. 22:1) A good name with the Lord, and his favor, can be had only by doing his expressed will, and those who love him will do that. Those who suffer privation, tribulation, poverty and reproach that they might be witnesses to the name of God and his kingdom are rich, as Jesus told the congregation of Smyrna.—Rev. 2: 9. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 49</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The spirit of God was upon Jesus when he spoke to his disciples, but that which is called the “comforter” or helper or holy spirit was to be sent and was sent after his departure from the earth. It was not the will of God that Jesus be employed with every detail concerning the life and affairs of his followers while he was in heaven, but that the other helper, the holy spirit, should aid them; and this is what came to pass. The Lord was not telling the members of the church directly what to do, but they were guided, helped and directed by the power of God, and that holy power moved the heart and mind of each one devoted to the Lord to do what was done. It was ready to operate upon the mind of each one who was ready to receive instruction and guidance. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark.—Rev. 11:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The ark of the covenant in the temple is a symbol of Jehovah’s presence. The blood of the atonement sacrifice was sprinkled upon the ark, representing the covenant by sacrifice. The completion of the covenant by sacrifice is Jehovah’s chief consideration during the Christian era, and particularly so during the period of the fulfilment of The Revelation. The complete establishment of the kingdom hinges upon the performance of this covenant, and in symbol the “ark” of Jehovah is now present in order that the blood of this sacrificial covenant may be sprinkled upon it in due course. The location of the ark was the place where the tribes of Israel went up and had a rally. (Ps. 122:4) Now at this day God’s faithful witnesses must rally to the performance of the covenant by sacrifice, and in so doing give praise to Jehovah’s name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 228</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Let no one delude you by any means, because the apostasy must come first.—2 Thess. 2:3, Diag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The word “apostasy” does not convey the meaning as fully and strongly as it really is. The word ‘rebellion’ seems much more appropriate, and one translation thus renders the text: “It will not come till the rebellion [revolt, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.]</span><span class="font5"> takes place first of all.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Moff.)</span><span class="font5"> Lucifer rebelled against God’s organization centuries ago, and the coining of the “man of sin” is stated to be “according to an inworking of Satan”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> “Falling away” means therefore a rebellion against God and his organization. Paul’s words locate that rebellion in “the latter times” or “last days”, where we now are. Furthermore, his words prove that the “man of sin” is made up of those who fall away or rebel against God and his organization. Therefore “let no man deceive you by any means”.

<p><span class="font5">The first disciples of Jesus were Jews and in the covenant with God which he had made with the nation of Israel, with Moses as the chief one. Jesus had now told them the truth that he is the Messiah whom Moses foreshadowed and that God had appointed him to be the King and Euler and that through his kingdom God would accomplish his expressed purposes. They having believed upon Jesus as the Messiah, God transferred them from the covenant with Moses to the covenant of sacrifice of Christ, that they might be a part of the seed of promise. Jehovah gave them to Jesus as his own. They had not yet been anointed of the holy spirit. That anointing they received at Pentecost. They were, however, in the covenant of Christ for the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">kin</span><span class="font5">gdom, and hence God confirmed and ratified that covenant at Pentecost by anointing them with his spirit. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This angel must be the deputy of the Lord who is in charge of the company of angels assigned to care for the interests of God’s anointed ones on earth. The anointed child of God is called upon to do all he can for his own protection in the way of using care and the spirit of a sound mind. He would be presumptuous to put himself in a position of danger and make no effort to protect himself and assume that the angel of the Lord would furnish all the protection. If, however, the performance of his duty throws him into a position of danger without his choosing, then he may be certain that the Lord will provide the needed protection. Every anointed one is a steward of everything committed to him, including his bodily care, his health, and his strength, to conserve his strength and use it to the best advantage.

This also shows that prayer is an essential part of the life of the faithful. Noone can hope to get on in his faithful service to the Lord without frequent prayer. This being “the last day”, it is the time to “continue in prayer, and watch in the same”. (Col. 4; 2) The remnant will not be able to stand without prayer and watchfulness. (Eph. 6:13-18) The Lord hears the prayer of the righteous, and the prayer of the upright ones is his delight. (1 Pet. 3:12; Prov. 15: 8,29) They pray for victory.

But that he creates evil there cannot be the slightest doubt, because his Word so says. There is a wide difference, however, between evil and that which is morally wrong or wicked. According to the Scriptures “evil” means that which brings adversity or hurt, affliction or sorrow. It is not necessarily morally wrong. Jehovah God, as the scripture states, created light, which is sown or made for those who do right. (Ps. 97:11) He created darkness, which is the portion of those who wilfully continue in wrongdoing. (2 Pet. 2:4) To those who are obedient to him he opens his hand and fills them with that which is good.

This gathering out is done by the angels, as the Lord states. When Christ Jesus, the Head of Zion, comes to set up his kingdom he is attended by his great retinue of angels; and it is reasonable that he would commit certain specific duties to them to perform; and one of these duties or works is to gather those who are approved of God and also to separate them from the wicked ones and shield and protect them from the assault of the enemy and his organization.

When he was away they would therefore be orphans and would need help; hence Jesus said to them that he would make request of his Father, who would send to them another helper. Jesus then promised them that they should not always be left in this condition as orphans, but that in some future time he would come for them. Until the return of the Lord, then, his true followers would be orphans; but would not be without help, because another helper would be sent.

It therefore becomes the privilege and duty of God’s witnesses on earth who are in the “everlasting covenant” according to the “sure mercies of David” to cry out to their brethren concerning the great truths of God’s expressed purposes. They are commanded to say: “Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters.” (Isa. 55:1) Those who thus hunger and thirst for the truth have been given a blessed privilege since the Lord came to his temple.

The watching is against Satan’s organization that no compromise with it shall be made, by which one’s garments would become defiled. God’s people must now be on the alert and stand wholly and entirely separate from every vestige of Satan’s organization. The Lord’s anointed are his watchmen and must let nothing cause them to deviate one jot or tittle from the faithful service of Jehovah. The servant class must be blind to everything except God’s kingdom interests.

That would mean that the kingdom interests were committed to the disciples of Jesus and that during his absence they were to look well to those interests. He did not send them forth and instruct them to develop a “character”, as that term is used by many in modern times. He did command them to ‘go and teach all nations and baptize them [that believe] in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy spirit, and teach them to observe the things that he had commanded them to do’.

Egypt is a symbol of the world wherein man dwells and which is under the supervision of Satan the enemy. God must take his ideal man out from the world, because man was to be found in no other place. In due time Jesus, the natural descendant from the house of King David, came and was made the true vine, the right hand planting of God. To his disciples that stood firm with him in his trials he said: “I am the vine, ye are the branches.” These disciples were invited into the kingdom covenant and we told what they must do.

It should be expected that the great lie is exactly opposite to or against the kingdom of God, and such it is. It is the great sin. The lie and sin are therefore anti-kingdom. Satan has been antikingdom since first he learned about it “The man of sin” is described as God’s opposes hence the opposer of God’s kingdom and of the work of God’s anointed in the interest of the kingdom. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">All creatures that ever learn any lessons of value will learn them by reason of a knowledge of God and his Word. That the truth of God’s Word is the best teacher is emphasized by what Jesus said to the Jews s “If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” The Jews had come in contact with sin time and again and had learned no valuable lessons. They had been drawn away from their covenant by the influence of Satan and his organization and were therefore in bondage to the enemy. It is so in this day, that many who profess to be the children of God are in bondage to Satan and his organization. All the experience they might have would teach them nothing of value, but a knowledge of the truth of God’s Word, and obedience thereto would teach them much. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.—Rev. 2:10, E. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The crown </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font5"> life” means the very pinnacle of life and also proves the overeomers’ immortality and glory with Christ Jesus. It means the complete victory over death, because “he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death”. (Rev. 2:11) This clearly shows that the test upon the faithful 'will be the greatest and will be such as will bring Jehovah’s approval to those who remain faithful, and is assurance that these will never deviate from their devotion to God. All of the remnant now wholly devoted to the Lord and who have the evidence of the Lord’s approval may be sure that continuing henceforth faithful unto death they shall have the blessed privilege of receiving that which is promised above.—Jas. 1:12. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">In the midst of the throne and of the four &quot;beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb, as it had been slain.—Rev. 5:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is “the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world”. His blood shed at Calvary is for sin atonement, and now he comes in his glory, clothed with all power and authority, to clean up and remove the sin-stain of the world. God must have a reason for emphasizing the title “Lamb”, which is derived from the word which more literally means “dear lamb” or “lambling”. The evident purpose is to remind all creation that God is the great Shepherd and that Jesus is the dearest One of God’s great flock. A lamb of the flock was slain and its blood was used as the basis for the law covenant made in Egypt and confirmed at Mount Sinai. The blood of Jesus, the Lamb of God slain on earth, is the basic sacrifice for the new covenant, which is made on earth and ratified at Mount Zion. Jesus, the Mediator of that covenant, is most loved of all God’s creation. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 302</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">In thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.—Ps. 16:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The servant class is now in Jehovah’s presence because in the temple of God. Their joy is now full because all do rejoice to their full capacity. Jehovah God has spread a feast for them in the presence of the enemy, and the cup of the “servant” now overflows. The oil of joy is upon his head, and his heart is filled with gladness. While this class is now rejoicing to the fulness of its capacity, it is clear from the text that such is not the complete joy which will be had when their glorious change comes to pass. The servant class is now on the right hand of Jehovah and has his favor and is the instrument which Jehovah uses to do his work, and, continuing in this place faithful to the end, its pleasures now begun will never end.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">~Ps. 16:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The servant class on earth see that their ‘change’ must come and that it will be from human to divine nature for those who are faithful. There must be an exodus or passing out of the church in death, but the faithful have confidence in an instantaneous resurrection. Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s great “servant”. The saints who died prior to his return slept in death until the resurrection day; but there is a time when the faithful do not sleep, and of that time and condition Paul wrote. With the coming of the Lord to his temple in 1918 the robe of righteousness was provided for the approved ones, and such are made a part of God’s “servant”. Every member of the “servant” class must reach the height of glory through death, but it is impossible for death to hold the faithful.

<p><span class="font5">The “evil servant” class now oppose the Society and those who go to make up God’s little remnant, and are desperately trying to turn these workers away from the activity of the service of the Lord. The weak and double-minded will be deceived. The faithful will not be deceived. It is certain that only those who have the love of the truth will be in the kingdom, and it is by obedience to God’s commandments that we prove our love. Therefore if for a selfish reason one is now persuaded to forsake the Lord’s service and the giving of the witness for the kingdom, it is certain that he could not be received into the kingdom. This would be particularly true if one quit the Lord’s service merely to engage in some worldly or selfish enterprise when not compelled to do so to support a dependent one.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, . . . stood before the throne.-Rev. 7:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This proves that the “great multitude” is not made up of those who were once anointed as members of the body of Christ and then lost their anointing. There is no Scriptural authority for saying that anyone can lose his anointing of the holy spirit and then fall back into the great multitude class. All of that great company were begotten of the holy spirit and were called, but did not respond to the call and hence were not chosen. However, they tenaciously hold to the truth that there is one God, and that the blood of Jesus Christ is the ransom price for man, and for this the Lord loves them. They were never brought into the covenant for the kingdom and anointed for the kingdom; therefore they stand before the throne and before Christ, as servants of the great High Priest. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 92</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In speaking of praying the Father to send the comforter or holy spirit, Jesus was addressing himself to those whom he had invited into the covenant for the kingdom. His words hardly seem to apply to those who do not respond to the call for the kingdom. Those who make up the “great multitude” class are a comfortless class and are called the “tribulation” class. They have never responded to the call, and have not been taken into the covenant, and it hardly seems reasonable that the holy spirit would act as an advocate for these, but rather that the administration of the holy spirit, as a helper, has been for the benefit of only those who have responded to the call and who therefore have been in line for the kingdom. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Eph. 4:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The church is thus pictured as growing up from childhood to manhood or maturity. The unity above mentioned did not exist completely in the days of the apostles, although it began there. It surely did not exist during the Dark Ages. The work which was begun at Pentecost was again taken up and continued after the beginning of the Lord’s second presence, approximately A.D. 1875, looking to the bringing of the church to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of Christ Jesus. The evidence seems quite conclusive that the gathering of these members of Christ’s body into the temple is almost complete, if not entirely so. A great separating work has been going on since 1918 and probably is not entirely completed, but those gathered into the temple are in this condition of unity. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Why would God furnish special protection to the remnant “in that day”? To the remnant is delivered the opportunity and responsibility of giving the testimony of Jesus Christ. These are Satan’s chief enemies on earth; and Satan, knowing this, goes forth to make war against them, and he does so with the wicked determination to kill them. God puts his hand over the remnant and, in substance, says to Satan: ‘You may oppose this company, but do not kill them. ’ They are under the protection of the Lord God because they are his witnesses and he gives them his message to deliver. (Isa. 51:15,16) It is the day in which preparation is being made for battle, and the Lord of hosts is shielding his witnesses who sing forth his praises.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, ... ye that fear him, both small and great.—Rev. 19:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is the servant class that fears God; and all members of this class, whether they be elders, deacons, young or old, male or female, must join in this praise, of service to Jehovah. All the servant class sealed in their foreheads must now do service to the glory of Jehovah God. Jehovah has appointed the manner of giving this praise. He has anointed his remnant to be his witnesses on the earth. No one who is of the remnant is to think more highly of himself than he ought to think, and therefore to think he is excused from active service to the praise of Jehovah because he is “great”. No one is to think he is too poor and lowly to have part in the song of praise to Jehovah. Jesus commands the song to be sung. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 149</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">look into.—1 Pet. 1:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The angels have known much and have had a keen desire to know more, that they might have more opportunities of service to the glory of Jehovah God. The waiting on their part for the establishment of the kingdom may have been a test upon them, and particularly when they saw that members of the kingdom were being selected from amongst the fallen human race. Without a doubt their faithfulness will be rewarded. In the invisible realm of Jehovah there has been and is an unfaithful and a faithful class of creatures, and it is even so amongst those on earth who have been favored by the Lord God. It is faithful service on the angels’ part that has brought God’s approval. It is likewise faithful service on the part of his anointed on earth that will bring his approval.

<p><span class="font5">The earliest singing mentioned in the Biblical record is in Job 38:7. There the Lamb, he who bears the title of “The Morning Star”, employed song to the praise of Jehovah; and thus is fixed the rule that must govern those of Zion now. The song John heard sounded new, which would indicate that the servant class would have a change in their witness work from that of Elijah to that foreshadowed by Elisha, the latter being a service attended with no fear but with great joy. It is the love of God that prompts them to service, and the love such as Christ has that constrains them and holds them together; and these fear not the enemy or his organization, but boldly sing forth praises of the great Eternal One and of his King Christ Jesus. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 308</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And now ye know what withholdeth [restrains, Diag.} that he might be revealed in his time.—2 Thess. 2:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The apostle states that there is a “falling away” preceding the “day of Christ” and then “that man of sin”, “the son of perdition,” is revealed. Prior to that time there is some power that withholds or hinders the manifestation of “the man of sin” although there has been working a “mystery of iniquity” for a long while. The withholding power is exercised in order that “he might be revealed in his time”, which due time for revealing “the man of sin” must be in “the day of Christ” and after the falling away. Since “the man of sin” opposes God and his work, that power which withheld the wicked one up till the day of Christ must of necessity be a divine power. Therefore it is clear that the holy spirit in its administration as a helper or advocate for the called ones who are in line for the kingdom was that restraining power. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/30</span></p>

Never before now have the anointed so fully appreciated the fact that in themselves they Can do nothing, but that because they are in the secret place of the Most High and abiding under the shadow of his wing, and because he has put his hand over them, and his words in their mouth, they are at rest in the Lord and can be mightily used by him. Only the weak ones, likened unto babes, are the instruments of praise which God uses. The work of singing the praise of Jehovah’s name is now being done by those who have faith and confidence in the Lord and who are devoted to him. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The fruits of the kingdom would be and are the orderly or tame fruits brought forth according to the rule laid down by Jesus. They consist of the lifesustaining message of truth that makes known that Jehovah is supreme, that Christ is his King, and that God’s kingdom will vindicate the word and name of Jehovah God The very purpose of the kingdom is to provide the way for the complete vindication of Jehovah’s word and name. It proves that the challenge that Satan flung in Jehovah’s face was a wicked one and that Satan is the wicked one and that God is right and his word is true. The fruit or message brought forth that tends to anything else or tends to bring about any other result or to magnify any creature’s name would be wild grapes. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">An advocate is one that makes intercession for another and acts as comforter for the one for whom he advocates. After Jesus ascended on high and took his place at the right hand of Jehovah he then and there became the advocate for the sons of God in the flesh. Because of the weakness of each one, the tendency is to sin; and hence each one needs an advocate. In addition to what Jesus would do in heaven as an advocate for the consecrated, he promised his disciples that he would pray his Father to send to them another comforter, or advocate. The word </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">parakletos, </span><span class="font5">comforter, or helper, also means advocate; and this helper would advocate for the church during the absence of Jesus from his followers.

There was then no organization prepared for work. Some preliminary steps must be taken. Then it was that God took his organization “into the wilderness”, or into the condition he had prepared for those of his organization on earth. The members of his organization must be fed and nourished and prepared for action. God and his beloved Son, working through other invisible members of his organization, made provision for his saints on earth. The prayer of such was, “Feed me with food convenient for me.” (Prov. 30: 8) The feeding the Lord did through the columns of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> and kindred publications. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 249, 250</span></p>

There is now a clearer vision of God’s purposes revealed to the temple class. To be sure, the church does not now have all knowledge, and in fact never will have all knowledge, but will at all times be inquiring in the temple of the Lord. There is, however, at this time a unity of knowledge concerning God’s organization, the enemy’s organization, the setting up of the kingdom, and the work that is now to be done by God’s anointed people.

They were not under sentence of death, for the reason that they had never been tried and sentenced. They were all born in sin by reason of being descendants of Adam, who had been sentenced to death. They were under condemnation because disapproved, Those people had turned away from Jehovah God and worshiped the Devil, opposed God’s anointed people, and brought reproach upon God’s holy name; and for the good of all creation God slew them, to make a name for himself or keep his name before creation until his own good time to completely vindicate it.

(Jas. 1:18) Then he sends out his spirit to help, comfort, and aid the begotten ones. God deals with these through Christ Jesus, and therefore the helper sent from God is sent in the name of Christ Jesus. This helper is also called “the spirit of truth”, sent forth by the Father at his Son’s request to operate for the benefit of his spirit-begotten ones. In just what manner the comforter, helper, holy spirit, or spirit of truth, operates is not revealed.

(1 John 2:1) “The word of their testimony,” which is also mentioned, manifestly means that these have been faithful witnesses to the name of God and of Christ, by giving testimony thereto. One cannot be pleasing to God if he does not act as a witness to God’s word and name. To be witness for him is one of Jehovah’s positive commandments.

It has been the means of communication between the Lord and the called ones who have responded to the call, and the means of revelation and instruction and understanding of such in his absence. When the Lord comes to his temple for examination and judgment those that are chosen and brought into the temple have no further need for the administration of the holy spirit as a helper or advocate because Christ Jesus himself is present with them and is their advocate and helper. When the temple class is complete, and all are gathered together unto Christ, whether on the other side or on this side the veil, then the holy spirit’s operation as a helper would cease.

Those who love God will keep his commandments.

Do they not put themselves into position to be deceived and led away by the sin of “that wicked” one? (2 Pet. 3:17) If so, then it appears that there may still be a further separating work to be accomplished in order that the approved ones may be made manifest.

Doubtless this has led to many of the more prominent elders’ receiving special attention from the brethren. Now in the light from the temple shining upon God’s people the faithful see that creature worship is not right. He who is the Creator of heaven and earth, and the Giver of everything that is good, is the One entitled to worship.

Jesus said this is what is required of those who continue to be of the vine: ‘You must abide in me, because otherwise you cannot bring forth the fruits that are acceptable to my Father, and you will be taken away and destroyed.’ Jesus said that no one can do anything without him, and then added: “If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. ’ ’ This is further proof identifying and locating the “wine vineyard” in the time of “the day of Christ” and of the gathering together unto himself of his own. These ask and receive what they need because they ask in harmony with the Head of The Christ. The fruits they bring forth are not their own fruits, but God’s fruit.

<p><span class="font5">God clothed Jesus with power and authority to act in his name. He put his spirit upon Jesus to carry into operation his purposes. He disclosed to Jesus his purposes, and Jesus was the instrument or agency God used to carry out the same. The spirit of God came upon Jesus at the Jordan, and a dove was used as a symbol thereof that John tie Baptist might be a witness to the fact. That was the time that Jesus was brought forth as the spirit creature of God. More than three years thereafter, and when Jesus was about to go away, he told his disciples that he would pray his Father and that his Father would send them another helper or comforter, and it was then that Jesus disclosed to his disciples that the comforter or helper that would be sent is the holy spirit. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Now the King in glory stands upon Mount Zion with all power and authority to rule and bless, and all of God’s organization join in the new song. The angels in heaven and the remnant on earth sing before the throne the praises of the Most High. The singers have the throne, and not who they are, in mind; they are not the ones of importance: it is the great Jehovah God, and his King, whose praises they sing. In the grand chorus the 144,000 are singing “before the four beasts’’, which means they are singing in the presence and hearing of Jehovah’s organization. They sing to each other and sing to all who love Jehovah God; they lift up a standard for the people and point them to God’s kingdom; they bring good tidings of great joy; they say to those of Zion, “Thy God reigneth.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 309</span></p>

They are better equipped to make the attack than any others. They are more ready instruments of Satan than any others. “The man of sin” once had the truth and still holds a mental understanding thereof. When the Lord removed the restraining power and protection from such, then Satan puts before them his special delusion and gathers them together, and they will constitute an opportune instrument in his hands. They will be united in opposition to the Lord’s work and to his people who are doing that work now on earth.

<p><span class="font5">‘Measuring the altar’ symbolizes that the remnant come to appreciate the fact that they are not sacrificing priests who are doing anything to add to Christ Jesus’ sacrifice. Christ Jesus is the great sacrificing Priest, and his sacrifice was sufficient once for all for the atonement of sins. The remnant, that is, the approved servant class on earth, must offer an acceptable sacrifice before the Lord and must come to know that such is merely rendering unto him their “reasonable service”, and that their sacrifice, which is acceptable to him, is their devotion and praise and service rendered unto the Lord. ‘They that worship in the temple, ’ that is, those that worship God in spirit and in truth, would be measured; and these are they that when approved are permitted to “stand in the holy place”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 188</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures prove that while Jesus was in the flesh God delegated authority to angels to protect and comfort him. After Jesus had been raised out of death he said to his disciples: “All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.” No longer would there be heed for the angels to serve him for protection. From that time forward the powers of heaven and earth must be subject to the Lord Jesus Christ and the angels would have a different function to perform from what they had previously done concerning him. In support of this conclusion it is written: “Jesus Christ, who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.” In the time of his weakness and humiliation the angels served him, and now in the time of his power and glory his angels serve him and carry out his orders. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The holy city is the heavenly organization completely separated from the wicked one and his organization, and every whit thereof dedicated to the Holy One, Jehovah; and therefore it is holy. Out of all the cities in the earth only one city was designated by Jehovah as “the holy city”, and that was Jerusalem. It was typical. And so in the antitype there is but one city or organization which forms a part of Jehovah’s greater organization and is “the holy city”. The name “new Jerusalem” means “the possession [foundation] of peace, the secure habitation”. It is the new organization composed of new creatures in Christ and called the “new creation”. Only the overcomers have its name written on them. It is organized in heaven, the abode of Jehovah. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 228</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark494"></a><span class="font5">This refers to the work of the holy spirit in the minds and hearts of the sons of God in the flesh, creating in such the desire to be wholly devoted to God. An advocate is an intercessor, and thus the holy spirit intercedes in behalf of the one earnestly desiring to serve Jehovah. All who responded to the call to the high or heavenly kingdom, and who are accepted by Jehovah, are accepted in “the beloved One”, and each one individually has his standing alone in him. Because of the imperfection of the chosen ones while tabernacling in the flesh they could be acceptable and are acceptable by God only in Christ Jesus. While Jesus was absent from them, and while he is engaged in 'preparing the way before the Lord’ and before he comes to his temple, the holy spirit operates as an advocate.

<p><span class="font5">This “the man of sin” does by assuming to teach and to represent God and to judge contrary to God’s Word. Hence he acts out of order, and is lawless, and is therefore gathered out from those who are for God’s kingdom. Upon the authority of Paul’s words the suggestion is made that those of “the man of sin” will increase in number and power of opposition and will claim for themselves that they are God’s “elect” and anointed, and will thus fulfil the place of the ‘false Christ’ foretold by Jesus, and thus “he within the sanctuary of God shall take his seat”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.) </span><span class="font5">The opposers set up the “commandments of men, that turn from the truth”, and they obey not God. “They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient.” (Titus 1:14,16) They engage in creature worship and in self-admiration. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/30</span></p>

Individually those of the remnant on earth must have their standing before God in the beloved One Christ Jesus, who is their advocate. These being in the temple, there would seem to be no good reason why there should be an advocacy in their behalf by the holy spirit, since the Lord is now with them. In other words their days of ‘orphanage’ have ended. Jesus said: ‘I will not leave you as orphans, but I will come to you again.’ Now he has come and gathered the temple class to himself, and these have been anointed of the Lord.

<p><span class="font5">Satan, by and through his organization, has brought forth to the people that which is claimed to be lifesustaining for mankind, but which in fact has brought suffering and death upon the human race. Such provision made by Satan and his organization is the “clusters of the vine of the earth”. God’s angel announces, in substance, that the time has come when God will destroy these clusters and will then give to the people the fruit of the kingdom of Christ, which is life-sustaining to mankind. The only part that God’s remnant on earth has to do with this work is the proclamation of the message of God’s vengeance and, thus doing, thereby invite the gathering of Satan’s organization against them to battle.—Zech. 14: 2. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 338</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah the Father is holy. Everything he does and performs, whether by direct action or by and through an agency, is necessarily holy. God is completely and wholly devoted to that which is right, and therefore everything he does is holy and righteous. Every agency which God employs, and which is completely in accord with his will, is holy. God’s holy spirit is not a separate or distinct person, being or creature; nor could it be properly said it is the influence of Jehovah, because influence means a causing to be moved or controlled by the operation of power. Jehovah possesses all power. For him to will that a thing shall be done is equivalent to that thing’s being done. His spirit is his power in operation to accomplish his will.

<p><span class="font5">The angel’s crying with a loud voice shows that the servant class on the earth must take up the message and tell it to others. It becomes to them the battle cry mustering God’s remnant on earth together, that they may take their assigned position before the great battle is fought. Their position is in the light and with a clear view of the opposing armies. The gathering is to “the great supper of God”. Therefore it is Jehovah’s supper which he is preparing, and the remnant shall be privileged to partake thereof. The birds are invited to feed upon the fallen hosts of the enemy’s organization; therefore they must represent the Lord’s remnant on the earth.

That song of praise, then, would necessarily include the remnant on earth, because these are the only ones on earth that see and appreciate the fact that the time has arrived for the marriage of the bride and Bridegroom, and these see this great truth when Zion is built up and they are brought into the temple.

<p><span class="font5">It seems certain that it is an inherited weakness of man to desire to justify himself before other men.

Many a consecrated person has said to himself: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘I</span><span class="font5"> represent the Lord and I must be very careful that I cause offense to none.’ Such convince themselves that they must take a moderate course even in the proclamation of the truth, because by so doing they expect to be esteemed of men.

<p><span class="font5">For those in the covenant with the Most High to think of Jehovah as the God who has chosen them for himself as his special people and to be the special recipients of his favor is insufficient and too narrow a view to take of the matter. The anointed sons of God must accept and receive Jehovah as their Lord and Master. That means the acceptance of and joyful compliance with God’s will concerning his sons. It means a close and intimate relationship of the sons with the great Father. To the one uttering the words of the above text Jehovah is all and everything. His desire is to be always in exact harmony with the will of the only true God.

The proof seems to establish the fact that with the Lord’s coming to his temple the faithful dead were raised out of death and made a part of The Christ in glory, and that those remaining on earth and who continue faithful even unto the end must go into death but are granted an instantaneous resurrection. The members of God’s servant class on earth today are comforted, encouraged and strengthened in hope with a better understanding of his prophecies which make it clear that those who are of the “servant” and who thus continue faithful shall not await in death but shall be changed immediately, by death and the resurrection, into the glorious likeness of Jesus Christ, the Head of God’s “servant”.

<p><span class="font5">While there was provided a fence or wall of protection for the vine described in Isaiah fifth chapter and -jvhich brought forth wild grapes, there is nothing of the kind mentioned concerning the “wine-vineyard” above. Prior to the coming of the Lord to his temple the holy spirit as helper, comforter and advocate constituted the protection or wall or fence which the Lord had provided for all who are in line for the kingdom. When Jesus Christ came again and 'gathered together unto himself’ his own faithful ones and they were made a part of the ‘elect servant’, then there was no need for such protection. The ‘elect servant’, under the Head Christ Jesus, is directly under Jehovah. Jehovah protects his own and each one who is a member thereof and who abides in Christ.—Ps. 91.

<p><span class="font5">The great laver before God’s throne in the temple, and which is discerned by the remnant, shows that the remnant is in the temple at the time it is discerned. The great laver, or “sea”, pictures the Word of God expressing his judgments. ‘His judgments are great and deep.’ (Ps. 36:6) The day of judgment having arrived, God’s judgments are as clear as glass to the remnant in the temple. “Mingled with fire” symbolically denotes the fiery indignation of Jehovah God against his adversaries. The faithful ones whom the Lord had resurrected in 1918 “had [then] gotten the victory over the beast”, and after 1918 the remnant got “the victory over the beast and over his image”; hence those that stand by the “sea” picture all the 144,000 composing the elect servant class. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 14</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jesus could not here have reference to those people of the world who have never known the Lord, but must refer to those who have once been favored with knowing something of the Lord and who then become ashamed of him and refuse or decline to serve him. There are those who are ashamed to take their stand wholly and unreservedly on the side of Jehovah and his King of glory although such claim to be followers of Christ. The time when such are denied before the angels of God must be at the time of Jesus’ coming to his temple for judgment, because that is the time when he comes in his glory and in the glory of his Father. “For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father, with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.” At that time he is accompanied by his angels.

<p><span class="font5">The word “souls” has no reference to human bodies, but refers to the glorious new creatures in heaven in form like to that of Jesus. In 1917 and 1918 God’s “two witnesses”, foreshadowed by John the Baptist and Elijah, were killed or “beheaded”. This specifically applied to the remnant. The description of beheading therefore seems to have reference specially to those faithful unto death rather than to those who make a consecration and are brought into Christ as the Head over the church. It is those who are in Christ and are “faithful unto death” that are promised the blessing of joint heirship with Jesus Christ. Their destiny is fixed with Christ for ever because of their faithful and unswerving devotion to Jehovah. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 195, 197</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It is the time of God’s judgment, and shortly he will execute his judgment upon all his enemies and ‘destroy their fruit from the earth’. The part that his faithful remnant has therein is to sing while he does the work of binding and punishing through his beloved executive officer; as it is written: “To execute vengeance upon the [nations], and punishments upon the people; to bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; to execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the Lord.” Those who now see their privilege of holding fast their integrity and of being faithfid delight to have part in the song of praise to Jehovah’s name. It is his message he has put in their mouths to be sung. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The holy city is ‘the city beautiful’ and not comparable to any other. It is immovable, gorgeous and sublime. Upon the first sight of it, John, being unable to find other words, said concerning it that it appeared as a bride prepared and adorned for her husband. The faith of God’s anointed people rests upon the glorious foundation of that city. It rests upon nothing that any creature has ever said or done. The remnant refuse to believe that the Word of God comes from any man. They know that it proceeds from Jehovah, and he has built a glorious organization for his beloved Son and has garnished the foundation thereof with precious stones. The foundation of this glorious organization not only makes the faith of God’s remnant sure but is a delight to the soul. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 246</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“The son of the man” is one of the titles that properly belongs to Jesus. “The man Christ Jesus” became the owner of everything that Adam might have possessed had Adam remained in harmony with God; but those things would have been confined to the earth. Christ Jesus became owner of all things, both in heaven and in earth. Concerning him it is written that God has anointed him heir of all things and put all things under him. Not only did Jesus become the owner of everything that Adam might have possessed, but by the covenant that Jehovah God made with him he became the owner of all creation in heaven and in earth and under the earth, which includes the lower animals and man. By the grace of God Jesus invited his disciples to have a part with him in that covenant. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The glorious Son of God is seated upon a white horse, denoting that he rides a righteous war mount and that his cause is a righteous one and will result in victory. Ever faithful to Jehovah from the beginning, one of the titles given to Jesus is “Faithful and True”. Jehovah appointed him as High Priest or chief executive officer forever and he was faithful to him that appointed him. God made Jesus his chief witness and Jesus has proven himself to be “the faithful and true witness”. (Rev. 3:14) It follows then that no one could be with him in that war except he be “called, and chosen, and faithful”. AU such must be conformed to the image of God’s dear Son, and that means to be faithful and true witnesses of Jehovah. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 165</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The prophet of God wrote concerning those who are brought into the secret place of the Most High and who abide there. Beyond any question of doubt his words above quoted apply to the invisible spirit creatures of Jehovah who are assigned to perform specific duties for the benefit of the church. We know that at this time Satan is making his desperate attempt to destroy those who keep the commandments of God and who have the testimony of Jesus Christ. (Rev. 12:17) It is certain that he would quickly succeed in his wicked work of destruction were it not for the protection which God has so graciously provided for them. The Scriptures advise how he has made such provision, to wit, by assigning his angels to the performance of that duty. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The result of the war in heaven found Satan entirely excluded from heaven and he could take no further offensive operations against the heavenly host. His wrath was great against God’s “woman”, God’s organization, and therefore the Devil must exercise his vengeance against God’s people on earth. Hence the above text is a warning to all of God’s anointed ones that they should expect the persecution of Satan and his opposition to be exercised by and through his agents as long as they are on the earth. This is conclusive proof that if any one is found earnestly and zealously serving God by giving testimony concerning God’s great name and purpose, that one will be persecuted by Satan and some members of his visible organization. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 246</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Israelites, by the terms of their covenant, were promised life if they would obey God’s law, and were told that death would follow a deliberate violation thereof. The only way creatures can possess and hold eternal life is to know and to obey God. By departing from their covenant the Israelites were destroying their opportunity for life. The name and word of God were involved; and, for their good, Jehovah God would keep before them that he is the only true God and the Giver of life. His action in bringing evil upon the Israelites was not selfish, but was because of his love for them and for the upholding of his word and name. He would have them know that they could not follow or worship the Devil and receive that which they so much desired, namely, life and happiness.

The command comes from Jehovah by the mouth of Jesus Christ, and the message is committed to his deputies, the angels, to be delivered. The anointed ones on earth are caused to understand the message of the hour, and therefore they are directed to say to their brethren, to one another, ‘Come; the water of life is flowing freely from the throne of God.; come and take up the glad song and declare that Jehovah is God, Christ is King, and the kingdom is here. ’ </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 280</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Fruit is a life-sustaining substance produced and supplied for the benefit of creatures in need thereof. It is utterly impossible for any creature by his own efforts, and unaided by divine power, to produce fruit. The fruit of the kingdom, therefore, is God’s fruit, and not that of man. God alone is the source of life, and his arrangement is to dispense life by and through his chosen elect servant. The fruit is the result of the effort put forth by the husbandman. Jehovah is the husbandman, and is therefore the One that produces the fruit. The kingdom is God’s, and the fruit thereof is the life-sustaining substance or truths that God produces that will result beneficially to the people who hear and obey him. As the tree is an instrument employed by the Creator to hold forth fruit, so are God’s servants instruments employed by him to hold forth or serve his fruit, which is the message of truth. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/30</span></p>

The angels are </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">part of God’s organization, and all are under the direction of Christ the King, or Judge at his temple. The “seven angels” here mentioned have the “seven last plagues” of the wrath of God, this meaning that to the deputies of Christ is assigned the duty of transmitting the fiery messages of truth to and for the illumination of the servant class on earth, which messages the latter are proclaiming in the presence and hearing of others. It is God’s witnesses who ‘smite the earth with plagues’, but these plagues or fiery messages are delivered to them from the Lord by the hand of his chosen deputies. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 12</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The fruit is God’s fruit. The kingdom is God’s; and the fruit of the kingdom, therefore, is that life-sustaining substance provided by Jehovah for the benefit of his creatures; to wit, the truth concerning God and his purposes. That the truth is Jehovah’s there cannot be the slightest doubt: “Thy word is truth.” To know God and his purposes through Christ Jesus means life, and it is the fruit of the kingdom that brings life and sustains life. Christ Jesus and his body members, all one, are like one tree or vine. As a tree or vine holds forth or holds up the fruit upon which men feed and grow strong, even so Christ and those who abide in him hold forth the fruit of the kingdom, the vital, sustaining truth which is provided by Jehovah and given to sustain the life of creatures.

<p><span class="font5">This means a world-wide witness work advertising the King from the east and his kingdom which is to bless all the people who turn to God. The preparing of the way of the kings of the east is the preparing or opening a way to get to the people for their good. The Lord could easily crush Babylon without any of this preliminary work; but such is not his way. He will give the people notice, and at the same time furnish his anointed people an opportunity to give that notice and thereby prove their faithfulness to him under stress. To have part in singing forth Jehovah’s praises by now telling the people that he is God, and what are his purposes, and doing so with joy, is proof that those so doing are of the ‘kingly class coming from the east’. Blessed are all such who thus continue until the consummation of the work. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 40</span></p>

Many have received the truth but have received it with a selfish desire and used it with a selfish motive, whereas those who will be saved are saved because they receive the love of the truth; that is to say, they unselfishly devote themselves to the truth that the word and name of God might be glorified. Many have looked forward to the kingdom that they might have the great honor, power and glory of ruling. The truth of God’s kingdom did not produce in them an unselfish devotion to God, which is the love of the truth. For this reason they are open to deception by Satan and are deceived.

Hence the marriage of the Lamb would be an occasion for great rejoicing in heaven and all the hosts of heaven would give honor and glory to Jehovah because he has arranged for the wedding. The marriage of the bride and Bridegroom, therefore, would mark another forward step in the outworking of the glorious purposes of Jehovah for the vindication of his word and name; The union of the Bridegroom and bride would be conclusive proof that Jehovah does have among his creatures those who would maintain and who do maintain their integrity with him, as illustrated with Job. Jehovah is the great King who makes the marriage for his Son Christ Jesus, and Jehovah should be given the honor and glory on that occasion. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 152</span></p>

Hence they will see the battle, and it will be a feast (sacrifice) to those who are on the Lord’s side. The fowls (the remnant) are advised of what is about to come to pass, and, gathering together, they are witnesses to the battle. Like all birds on such an occasion, they sit in a sheltered or protected place and sing.

Regardless of how kind, pure, gentle, meek and pious one might be, that would not be doing God’s work in the way he has commanded. One not begotten of the holy spirit might have and manifest all these good qualities. The new creature in Christ must go much farther than that. He should strive to be good and noble, pure and righteous; but in addition thereto he must devote himself to the Lord and bring forth the fruit of the kingdom if he would be of the kingdom ultimately. This bringing forth fruit is not for his own personal development, but is that others might profit by knowing of God’s purposes.

God’s anointed people would from that time forward carry out the commands to give a wide testimony of God and his kingdom. Facts show that the work has been progressing, and particularly since 1922. The tabernacle denotes God’s presence with men in the representative capacity of his sanctuary class. Since the kingdom has begun, surely God will have on earth some representative from henceforth and forever; first the remnant, and then those faithful men who shall be “princes in all the earth” shall represent the kingdom and teach the people. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 230 Touch no unclean thing; ...be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord.—Isa. 52:11.</span></p>

The son of God must do that and much more. He must perform his covenant. He does so by bearing the fruits of the kingdom to others. The more zealous and faithful he is in so doing, the more pleasing he is to God, and the more he honors his name. Blessed is the one who has the privilege now of bearing the fruits of the kingdom. The rule that Jesus announced shows that no one can be of the kingdom who fails or refuses to avail himself of opportunities that come to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5"> to bring forth the kingdom fruits.

These, together with the other faithful ones who went before, will make up the members of Christ’s body, his bride, and are his holy city. Never shall there be any curse in God’s holy organization again. (Mal. 3:12) Jehovah’s throne will be there, and the throne of the Lamb. This will result in great benefits to mankind.</span></p>

The truth alone would not be sufficient to protect these from his assaults. It is only reasonable to understand that Zion is more powerful than Satan’s organization, and that Jehovah has delegated certain servants in Zion, to wit, his angels, to safeguard the interests of his people and that these do reaping work.

(Margin) It represents everlasting life by means of the unfailing sustenance which the Lord provides for his Own. Divine wisdom is likened unto a tree of life. (Prov. 3:13-18) Jehovah is the fountain of life, and even the 144,000 immortal ones will depend upon him that they may not “be hurt of the second death”.

It must be that those making up both these classes had responded to the call for the kingdom and that one class shows a proper condition of heart while the other shows an improper condition.

Earthly relatives often induce one to divide his affections with things of this world, which pertains to Satan’s organization, by giving less consideration to the service of God and to his kingdom. They argue that one should not make himself foolish and obnoxious to the world, but should show the proper honor to the world and to men and institutions of the world. Thus they are caused to worship or give honor to the Devil’s organization and are defiled.

Those once enlightened and who have become of the “evil servant” class, and who slander their own mother’s son (children of the covenant), are seeking vengeance, and in so doing are prompted by ill will. This is proof that “in that day”, when God is establishing his kingdom, his truth and his praise will be spoken only by his “babes and sucklings”, God’s faithful now on earth who are of the remnant. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.—John 4:34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Where God has committed to his anointed ones certain work to do it is reasonable to conclude that he would afford all needed protection until such work is done. This is fully supported by the record concerning Jesus. Satan made repeated attempts to kill him and could not do it until the proper time arrived, and then it was that Jesus said: “I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.” When he died he said: “It is finished.” It must be considered true that where one has been assigned to do certain work and he is faithful in the performance of it he will be shielded from the enemy until his work is done. The anointed, therefore, need fear neither man nor devil as long as they are faithful to God and serving him. They should fear God, and him alone.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s holy angels have been honored with much service in the name of the Most High. But never have any of them received the honor that he has conferred upon his beloved Son. Although complete power and authority were in the hand of Christ Jesus when he ascended into heaven he must wait until Jehovah’s due time to exercise that power and authority. Such could not be exercised until Christ Jesus was placed upon the holy hill of Zion by his Father. The Scriptures and the facts show that this enthronement took place in 1914, at the end of the world. Doubtless all the holy angels of heaven have been at Jesus’ command from and after his ascension into heaven, and these are they that fought with him against the enemy in-the great “war in heaven”.—Rev. 12: 7.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit.—Bev. 9:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No one but Christ Jesus is given the key to the bottomless pit, or abyss. At his death he went into the abyss, or “pit”, but God brought him up therefrom; and having gained this victory over death he would be the one properly entrusted with the key thereto. (Ps. 16:10; Acts 3:15) The divine record is that Jesus will open the bottomless pit at the end of the thousand years to let Satan out for a short season; and Jesus opens that pit or abyss for the sleeping saints to come out in due time. When Jesus was on the earth he, and none other, had received authority over the abyss or pit. The Scriptures identify Jesus Christ as the King and Commander and the Head of the ‘elect servant’ of God, and the members thereof as an organized band or company go forth under him their superior commander. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 142, 145</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 16: 3, 4, Roth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These words are in harmony with Isaiah 42:1, wherein Jehovah expresses his delight in his “servant”. The Lord is pleased to reveal his truth henceforth to those who give honor and glory to the great Creator and not to creatures. When the Lord came to his temple he put a test upon his professed followers, which test was made to the end that the approved ones might offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. That group of persons, however, who ignore Clod’s appointed way and insist upon worshiping the Lord in their own appointed manner eould not be pleasing to the Lord. This group is described as hurrying backward. They claim to worship Jehovah, but are doing it hypocritically. They insist on worshiping God through the image of their own making.

<p><span class="font5">No one eould be of the above class unless he had once been made righteous through the blood of Jesus. When he becomes offended and walks in iniquity he is disapproved by the Lord. Jesus told of a class of persons accepted in the Lord and in line for the kingdom but who at the end of the period of sacrifice are taken out of the kingdom class. He described a “wicked servant” class who smite their fellow servants and who are disapproved and assigned to the position Occupied by the hypocrites; and that such work takes place before the Millennial reign. (Matt. 13: 42; 24:48-51) When he comes to his temple and takes account with his servants and pronounces his decree of judgment, that decree is final. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 270</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Thess. 2:12, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is to be expected that Satan would bring forth a counterfeit in that it would be looked upon by many as God’s kingdom, because that would be the best way to deceive. “The man of sin” is used for this very purpose, and thereby exalts himself and sets himself up as the anointed of God. There is but one class of people on earth that fits the above description or that Satan could possibly use for this purpose, and that class is made up of those who once received a knowledge of the truth concerning the second c</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">omin</span><span class="font5">g of Christ and his kingdom but who did not receive the love of the truth.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">of God.—Rev. 14:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This message manifestly is to warn the people against taking sides with Satan’s organization since God’s kingdom has come. Since the discerning of Satan’s organization by the Lord’s people in 1925 they have particularly sounded the warning by radio, by public discourses, and by millions of books put in the hands of the people, and they have especially warned the consecrated through the columns of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower.</span><span class="font5"> God’s anointed people, in the mouth of whom he has put his message of truth, must boldly and fearlessly preach that message and continue to do so until the end regardless of whether the people hear or not.

The Bridegroom is with them, and he is the Head of Zion and the chief one in it, and therefore all rejoice and sing. They sing to each other because they know that Jehovah is their God and Father and that they are of his “vineyard of red wine”, which is his joy. Because they bring forth the fruits of the kingdom Jehovah is pleased with such and assures them that he will afford his protection and blessing. They sing because they are safe from the enemy and have the privilege to honor God’s holy name. They begin their song and continue to sing it “in that day” when the Lord is preparing to punish the enemy. The song must begin before Armageddon, and the singers continue until the battle is fought.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And the building of the wall of it was of jasper; and the city was pure gold.—Rev. 21:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the wall of the holy city applies to the glorified members of the Christ, it would seem to signify immortality to such, and therefore that the second death can never have any power over them. Jehovah is a glorious wall of protection to his people; and those in that city will abide there forever in safety and be forever like him. “As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth even for ever.” Jehovah is the builder of the city and forever keeps it. (Ps. 125:2; 127:1) God makes everything of his holy city of pure gold. That denotes that it is divine. All members of the bride of Christ are “vessels of gold” in Jehovah’s royal house. (2 Tim. 2:20) It is the gold bought of the Lord and “tried in the fire”.—Rev. 3:18. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 241-246</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“The day of Christ,” according to the Scriptures, is not exactly synonymous with “the day of Jehovah”. It was in 1914 that Jehovah placed his Son upon his throne and sent him forth as his representative to rule and to oust Satan the enemy, and therefore that date marks the beginning of “the day of Jehovah”. The expression “day of Jesus Christ” evidently means the time in which all the members of Christ are separated from others and the approved ones are brought into the temple and anointed. Since the resurrection of the saints took place (we believe) in 1918 and preceded the examination and judgment of those on earth, “the day of Christ” could not begin until 1918 and, it may well be said, will be completed only when all the body members are selected and completely separated from all others of the spirit-begotten ones and brought into the temple.

<p><span class="font5">It must be true that God has but one organization doing his work on earth. It would be wholly unreasonable and inconsistent for God to have two opposing organizations and both actually doing his work. God is not inconsistent in anything. That being true, then any company that would oppose God’s organization and forsake it would thereby be forsaking and opposing the Lord. This is evidently the class referred to by Isaiah. The sacrifices of such class being contrary to God’s appointed way, he says concerning those who thus sacrifice and concerning their sacrifices: “Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations.”—Isa. 66: 3.

<p><span class="font5">This raiment is provided preparatory for the wedding; and this could not be done after the remnant has reached heaven and after being united in heaven to the Bridegroom. It must therefore mean the approval received by the remnant from Jehovah through Christ and granted to those who keep God’s commandments in carrying out the terms of their covenant. The Lamb’s wife must first receive the approval of Jehovah, manifested by the robe of righteousness, and then continue faithful unto the end. These “righteous acts”, then, consist of full obedience to God in keeping his commandments and giving the testimony of Jesus Christ committed to them. In this manner the remnant prepare to meet the Lamb, and become a part of his bride. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 155</span></p>

The trumpet is sounded for the encouragement of others and denotes confidence for victory. It is a public proclamation that events of great importance are being enacted and that righteousness must prevail. The angels now do the gathering work. And what do the faithful followers of Christ on earth do? They sound the truth to each other as clearly as the trumpet call, announcing that the kingdom of God has begun. The fact that the angels invisible to man are having a part in the gathering would not in the least relieve the anointed ones of God’s children now on earth from their responsibility.

These faithful ones refuse to worship or have anything in common with Satan’s organization.

God has recently given his people a dearer understanding of many of the prophecies, and, true to his promise (Isa. 42:9), now shows them things before they come .to pass and which are about to come to pass. They see that eventually Satan’s organization will be divided against itself and shall fall even as Moab, Ammon and Mount Seir were divided and fell. The Lord has disclosed the three portions of Satan’s organization and has given a vision of his own army to his people that they might assault and expose not merely the ecclesiastical division of the enemy’s organization, but also its commercial and political divisions. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 62</span></p>

He conquered all the enemies of the Israelites. He stood for “the Lion of the tribe of Juda”, which tribe of Israel was brought up out of Egypt. In due time Jesus, “the offspring of David,” came and was made the true vine, the right hand planting of God. Jesus announced God’s unchangeable rule that the vineyard denotes God’s people, and that only those who bring forth the fruits thereof can be approved and taken into the kingdom.

<p><span class="font5">The Lord did not need the peoples (pictured by the great river Euphrates) to be all or partially turned away from Babylon before he would be able to invade and overthrow Babylon. The people, however, needed to have some information concerning God’s purpose to overthrow Babylon, in order to give them an opportunity to flee therefrom. Turning the people away from Babylon, and particularly informing the “prisoner” class, would enable them to see the great advantage of fleeing from Babylon and coming to God; therefore God has commanded his people on earth to prepare the way for the people by lifting up his standard and pointing mankind to the kingdom.—Isa. 62:10. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 40</span></p>

It is therefore properly called the best resurrection or chief resurrection. Jesus is “the first-born from the dead”. This resurrection is limited to Christ and all those of the elect servant, and there is a glory attached to it that no others receive. (Isa. 42:1-8) These are not only blessed, but holy. Holiness is one of the requirements of the elect servant class. That means a complete devotion to God; and their sanctification is made complete by having a part in the first resurrection.

The faithful apostles and those who followed their righteous course also held fast their integrity. The day of resurrection came and these were gathered unto the Lord. Upon earth the separating work progressed and the Lord Jesus continued to ‘gather together unto himself’ (2 Thess. 2:1) the faithful ones. This he has done, and is doing, in defiance of the enemy. These faithful ones, thus found faithful up to that point, had held fast their integrity and proved their faithfulness and devotion to God and that they possessed the love of the truth.

The remnant was taken from among them, and now these must abide in Christ and bring forth much fruit, else they cannot be of the kingdom. The fruit consists of God’s life-giving and life-sustaining message of truth. It honors Jehovah’s word and name and declares his supremacy and the perfection of his works. It proclaims Jesus as the One who held fast his integrity and proved God’s Word true and right, and who provides redemption for man with his precious blood. It makes known God’s kingdom and declares the day of his vengeance upon Satan’s organization.

<p><span class="font5">The symbolic vision shows Christ taking his power in 1914 with a erown upon his head and “in his hand a sharp sickle”. (Vs. 14) Since judgment began three and a half years later, which means that the examination began there, it follows that the harvest work would begin at that time, to wit, in 1918. Jesus comes with a “sharp sickle” ready for action to cut away those not approved and to gather the approved ones into Zion. In the reaping or gathering the sleeping saints are first brought forth. The angels of the Lord do the reaping. (Matt. 13:39-41) The faithful on earth do the witness work, and are gathered by the Lord into Zion. The faithful ones of earth carry the spiritual provender to others, that they too may know the way to go.—Matt. 24: 46. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 335, 336</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Since 1918 the judgment has been on, and it is positively and plainly written that those who love God will have boldness in proclaiming the truth in this time. It follows that those who oppose the proclamation of the message of truth have not the love of God and not “the love of the truth”. (1 John 4:17, 18) The proper appreciation of the truth produces unselfishness in the heart that is honest toward God, and that child of God is anxious to tell others of the truth, that the name of God may be honored. But if one receives the truth and holds it selfishly and looks to what he can obtain thereby for himself, he has not the love of the truth and he will not abide the day of the examination, the day of the coming of the Lord to his temple. The light of the truth is from God, and one who receives it desires it to shine out from him to God’s praise. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The spirit of God may be defined as the power of God in operation to accomplish his will. When he puts upon a creature his spirit and empowers that creature to do a certain or specified thing, that power operates wholly to accomplish God’s expressed purpose. When God called Moses and sent him down to Egypt the purpose was to make a name for Jehovah of and concerning his purposes toward the people, and particularly concerning his purpose to have a kingdom that would vindicate his word and name. Moses was used to foreshadow the reality to come later. Not all of the power of Jehovah was used to accomplish that end, but all the power that he did use was holy, or completely devoted to that purpose. ‘God hath also given unto us his holy spirit. ’—1 Thess. 4: 8.

One’s approval by the Lord can be had only if he first earnestly and honestly puts forth his best endeavors to be obedient to God. He cannot be obedient to God unless he is guided by God’s Word. Men with good intentions organize and carry on schemes of reformation but Satan soon gets control thereof. The Christian’s proper course is this: He must diligently strive to be pure in word and action and hold himself aloof from such man-made schemes and at all times diligently bear witness to the name and purpose of Jehovah God and point out to the people who will hear him that God in Ids due time will bring about their desire and the proper results for mankind. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/30</span></p>

It has no application to the millennial reign of Christ, but to the last days of the gathering of the kingdom class. There have been many begotten of the holy spirit and who have received the call for the kingdom. Not all have responded to the call, and, comparatively speaking, only a small number have been chosen.

But Judas looked forward to it with a selfish purpose, that he might receive some peculiar personal benefit therefrom. He did not receive the love of the truth, that God’s name might be vindicated, and he willingly fell into Satan’s trap and betrayed the Lord. Judas foreshadowed the “evil servant” class. He is described as “the son of perdition” or destruction. The “evil servant” is made up of that class that responded to the call for the kingdom and looked for the Lord’s second coming but had a selfish motive which induced them to take a selfish course of action. Jesus stated that their fate is the portion assigned to the hypocrites, which is destruction.—Matt. 24: 51. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The members of the “faithful and wise servant” class preached the gospel of the kingdom because they loved God and their brethren, and they diligently sought to bring forth to their brethren meat in due season. They did not prepare the meat or fruits, but gladly served what God had provided. Upon coming to the temple the Lord Jesus identified the “faithful servant” class and committed to them all his goods, which constitute the “goods” or “fruits” of the kingdom, which God had committed to Him. This “faithful” class, to continue as such, must now bring forth the fruits of the kingdom. In no other way can they be faithful to their covenant and receive the approval of the Lord and in due time enter into the glory of the kingdom. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Rev. 18:20, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The expression of God’s.vengeance in the destruction of Satan’s organization will be a vindication of his word and name and call forth rejoicing because of the execution of his righteous judgment. This is one of the Scriptural proofs that God will permit some of his faithful remnant to be on the earth at the time of the complete destruction of Satan’s organization and that these will join in the song of joy. Jehovah God will do the great work of destruction, and not man; but those who love God he invites to sing for joy because of his vindication. In the above verse the words &quot;ye saints” no doubt include the remnant on earth who will rejoice and sing to the glory of God because his name has been avenged. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 138</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Cursed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image, an abomination unto the Lord.—Deut. 27: 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Image-making is anti-God. The tendency of images and image worship is to turn the people away from God and turn them to God’s enemy. The real reason, therefore, for God’s forbidding the making of images was and is that the creature should give his entire devotion to his Creator, and not be led into the ways of error. God could not be injured by what his creatures might do, but his creatures, by turning themselves to God’s enemy and looking at images and not to Jehovah, do violence to their own interests and bring great injury to themselves. Image-making and image worship is therefore an abomination in God’s sight. Professed Christians, by insisting that the only true worship is by and through their church leaders and church organizations, set up for themselves an image for worship. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah alone can give life everlasting, because he is “the fountain of life”. “For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.” (Ps. 36:9) There is no exception to this divine rule; it includes his beloved Son, the King of glory: “He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever.” (Ps. 21:4) All creatures who will live forever must know these truths and conform themselves thereto. There is but one true God. Jehovah is his name. “In his favor is life.” There is a false mighty one, or god, who may well be called “the mimic god”. The kingdom of this god, Satan, is darkness and death, and the end thereof shall be everlasting destruction. The kingdom of God is light and life and holiness, and blessed are they that flee into it. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 230, 231</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Doubtless these angels have to do with seeing that none enter save those who comply with the rules of the kingdom, and, also, they gather out or turn away all offenders and workers of iniquity. Only the righteous enter. All who enter or who give attendance at the gates must be singing Jehovah’s praises and declaring his judgments and safeguarding his interests. This rule would apply to all on earth who are anointed servants of the Most High. Written on the gates are the names of the twelve tribes of Israel; which denotes that only true Israelites enter and are made a part of the holy city, and that they who do enter or who are in attendance on the city are engaged in praising the Lord and declaring his judgments. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 242</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Wine is often used symbolically to picture good cheer, gladness and joy. Wine comes from the vineyard which God has planted to gladden the heart of man. It is to be expected that Jehovah would have pleasure in those who maintain their integrity and uphold his word and name. The wise man is he who delights himself in the Lord and joyfully obeys his commandments, and in such God has pleasure. “My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.” (Prov. 27:11) A wine vineyard therefore fitly represents the one with whom God will be well pleasei Since the insolent challenge was flung in Jehovah’s face Satan has constantly reproached God’s word and name. God’s “faithful and wise servant”, pictured by the vineyard of good wine, has shared such reproaches and will make glad the Father’s heart. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.—Rev. 14:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is proof that Satan’s organization is great and mighty, because it requires so great a wine-press. Some who have consecrated themselves to God ignore this and many other scriptures, and say that Satan has no organization and that we should say nothing about the world. In this they deceive themselves. When one takes a view of the tremendous organization that Satan has built up it is at once apparent that nothing short of divine power can destroy it. The mere proclaiming the truth for a million years would not accomplish that result. The work of the remnant on earth is not to tread the wine-press, but to serve notice upon the rulers and the people that God through Christ will do that work. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 342, 346 We glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience hope; and hope maketh not ashamed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Rom. 5:3-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christians, when persecuted or afflicted, triumph through such wrongdoing by reason of being in Christ and remaining stedfast and true to Jehovah God and to the terms of their covenant; knowing that such tribulation (affliction) works out patience (which means constancy in the performance of duty and continuing in so doing with an inherent joy, knowing that one is right and pleasing God), and such patience is evidence or proof of “experience”, that is to say, approval by the Lord; and such approval increases the hope of complete victory. That hope makes the Christian not ashamed, but bold for the Lord and for the proclamation of has Word and name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Prov. 29: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God has chosen and pruned his faithful remnant that they might bring forth much fruit to his honor and glory. These have learned wisdom by obeying God’s commandments and have entered into the joy of the Lord. For their benefit it is written: “My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord; neither be weary of his correction; for whom the Lord loveth he correcteth: even as a father the son in whom he delighteth. Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding. ” (Prov. 3: 11-13) Happy is the anointed one of God who bears the message of God’s kingdom to others, that the Word and name of Jehovah might be made known. By this means, and this alone, can God’s creatures on earth now bestow glory and honor upon his name. “The lips of the wise disperse knowledge.”—Prov. 15:7.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations.—Rev. 19:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The sword is a war implement and the instrument of judgment. The sword proceeds out of the mouth of Christ Jesus. That means that when Christ utters the command to his army to destroy, it shall he done. (Ps. 33:9) Jehovah has made his Mouth (Christ Jesus) his spokesman and sharp sword. (Isa. 49:2) God’s faithful witnesses on earth utter his sharp judgments, and to that extent their mouths are made a sharp sword. They utter not the words of the remnant, to be sure, but the words they utter are God’s words. &quot;When Jesus speaks the command of the great battle it seems certain that the action will be sharp, quick, and decisive. He carries into action the will of God. God needs only to will a thing to be done and it is done. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 169</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">In the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them.—Matt. 13: 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Manifestly the “tares” here mentioned as being gathered out would be in line for the kingdom, because otherwise they could not be gathered out. Being in line for the kingdom, knowing of the kingdom, and expecting the Lord’s second coming and his receiving them into the kingdom, nevertheless they are gathered out for some reason; and Jesus assigns the reason to be that they offend and do iniquity. “Iniquity’’means lawlessness. Paul’s statement is that the “man of sin” is the worker of iniquity while at the same time setting himself up as God’s special representative. Jesus’ description of the “evil servant” class that is gathered out and deprived of an opportunity for the kingdom and the description of the “man of sin” are essentially the same, and refer to one and the same class.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. —John 15:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is the One who has planted the vine because he is the One that selected and appointed Jesus to the position of the great High Priest and chief executive officer and Head of the kingdom. It is Jehovah’s vine or tree and Jehovah’s fruit which He produces. Without the Father Jehovah nothing could be accomplished; therefore Jesus was acting specifically upon the instruction from Jehovah and as his instrument. Those who would be associated with Jesus in his organization and kingdom are likened unto branches in that true vine, and every branch will be required to bear or bring forth fruit; and those who put forth an effort in obedience to the commandment to bear or bring forth fruit God would prove or disapprove, that they might be enabled to more efficiently perform their covenant.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.—Rev. 19:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To make herself ready the church must clean herself up. She must do more than that. She must prove her real devotion to the Lord, that she may have his approval and that she may receive the robe of righteousness and the wedding garments and keep them on. She must be robed properly for the occasion. Her garments prior to this were “as filthy rags”, and she must have a change of raiment, which the Lord provides. This change of raiment and robe of approval the remnant must receive while on earth; and thus properly clothed, she is in a condition of approval. This approval is evidenced by the robe of righteousness received after their being brought into the temple. These approved ones therefore constitute “the feet of him”, the Bridegroom, and they go forth to proclaim the great message of salvation. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 155 Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.—Isa. 8:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The remnant see that Satan’s “flood” of schemes has deceived many, but it cannot deceive God’s elect. Many professed ones have said: “Let us go easy and say nothing about the clergy or the Devil’s organization. Let the Devil alone and talk about something else.” But the true and faithful have not heeded such. To those forming alliances and confederacies to reform and upbuild Satan’s old broken-down organization (the world) the faithful say: “Associate yourselves [together], . . and ye shall be broken. . . . Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.” This they say because the Lord God directs them and they follow his commandments. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 254</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[the] saints.—Rom. 8:27, Diag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the Lord comes to his temple and gathers his approved ones into the temple, is there any further need for the office of the holy spirit as a helper or advocate? When Jesus was on earth he had no advocate, because God dealt directly with him. When Jesus gathers those of the temple to himself, and they are clothed with the garments of salvation, they are also brought under the robe of righteousness. The temple class then becomes a part of the ‘elect servant’ of God. It would seem there would be no necessity for the “servant” to have an advocate such as the holy spirit, because the “servant” is in direct communication with Jehovah and as Jehovah’s instrument, and Christ Jesus acts directly for the entire body. Hence the advocacy of the holy spirit would there cease. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The “song of the Lamb” denotes the song of praise; because the Lamb is of the tribe of Judah, and Judah means praise. “I will declare thy name unto my brethren; in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.” (Heb. 2:12) Jesus gained a great victory over Satan when he cast him out of heaven, and that victory and the deliverance of the faithful after 1918 are cause for rejoicing and song. Therefore the singers join in praise to the name of Jehovah for what he has done and for what they see he is going to do, and they sing: “Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways.” It is Jehovah, “the King of eternity,” that sits upon the throne, and his praises they sing. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jude announced that Enoch prophesied the above. This prophecy plainly shows that such adverse judgment begins upon those who were once enlightened and who turn away from God and against his anointed ones. It has been said that this prophecy refers to the members of the church coming with Jesus to do the judgment work. The word “holy” above used means “pure, blameless”, and would therefore not necessarily refer to God’s anointed ones in Christ. There is no good reason to apply the text to Christ’s body members, whether in glory or on earth, and to say that they are the holy ones, saints, or pure ones mentioned by the prophet. Every reasonable conclusion is that the reference is to the holy angels or spirit creatures who have ever remained faithful to God, and who attend Jesus on coming to his temple. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/30</span></p>

(Isa. 42:7) The Lord has provided the radio as a means of reaching those who would not hear otherwise, that they might be awakened to the importance of the hour. Then others call at the doors with the printed message, that the thirst of these prisoners might be slaked. It is now the privilege and duty of the remnant to carry God’s message to them that they may know that he has said to them, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let</span><span class="font5"> him that is athirst come.” Many of these are now receiving the truth.

<p><span class="font5">How is one perfected in love, which is the “fruit of the spirit”! Not by means of idleness and indifference concerning God’s witness work. One proves his love by keeping the commandments of God. This is the day of judgment, since the Lord has come to his temple; and concerning this and love it is written: “Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment.” (1 John 4:17) He who fears to offend any part of Satan’s organization or fears that some one will not think so well of him, and for that reason refrains from a bold proclamation of the message of the kingdom at this time, is not perfect in love. It is those who love the Lord that are bringing forth the fruits of the kingdom. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah awards the prize only to those who do his will. That would mean that whatever is done must be done lawfully. The motive inducing action must be unselfish. All who will ever receive the award of the prize must be governed by the same law. The prize is awarded to “one” (class or body) who strives lawfully and who </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">wins.</span><span class="font5"> Some respond to God’s call and are in line for the kingdom but do not win because not striving lawfully. Because not running lawfully they cannot be crowned. The prize is the crown of life to be conferred on that class of called ones who strive lawfully and are therefore faithful and true even unto death. Hence, in order for the called ones to win, the course of action taken by them must be a lawful one, that is to say, the one marked out by the Lord. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">There is only one street or broadway in the city; and that means to the remnant that there is only one way to walk in God’s organization, and that is the right way. “He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction.” (Prov. 10:17) That way is “the way of thy precepts” and “the way of truth”. (Ps. 119: 27, 30) “The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous.” (Ps. 1:6) God’s faithful ones walk in the light. (1 John 1:7) That street or broad way being of pure gold shows there is no dross or litter in the way of the city. Everything is clean and pure.

He made it clear that by and through that kingdom the Eternal One would have his will fully executed in the earth as well as in heaven. He taught his disciples always to pray for the coming of that kingdom.

They are being attacked by the opposers, and mention is here made of it, not for the purpose of controversy, but that God’s people may be encouraged in seeing the fulfilment of prophecy as it is manifested by the will of God. When it is clearly seen that the opposition to God’s work was long ago foretold by his prophet, and that the prophecy is being fulfilled now, such is a great encouragement to the faithful and is an evidence that the Lord is dealing with them and that they are in his favor. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15/30 the words of the prophecy of this book, If any num shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book.—Rev. 22:18.</span></p>

Jesus is speaking authoritatively from the temple of judgment. God has declared that his anointed ones shall be his witnesses in the world now. (Isa. 19:19,20) Let no one today add to his prophecy by saying that a pile of stone in Egypt constitutes God’s witness. God has made known that Satan’s organization and all who support it shall be destroyed in Armageddon.

That judgment, written long centuries ago, will be understood and appreciated in advance of its execution by those of the chosen “servant” class, and by that class alone. Surely one of the reasons why the Lord tells the chosen ones of these approaching things concerning judgments is that they might be forewarned and keep themselves in the love of God. Jehovah has also written his judgment concerning the faithful ones. He has laid down the rules by which the faithful are to be identified, and the terms and conditions they must meet, and has left to Jesus the work of determining who meets or measures up to those requirements.

<p><span class="font5">Jesus (the vine) and his body members (the branches) are one in this, that he is the Head, and directs the course of action of his body, and works under the direction of his Head, the husbandman Jehovah; and the body members bear the fruit, or do work as directed by the Head; and this oneness Jesus proves by his words: “Abide in me, and I in you.” Those in the body of Christ must, in order for them to abide there, bring forth the fruits of the kingdom, and must bring them forth according to the commandments of the Lord, One in Christ, if failing or refusing to bring forth or bear the fruits of the kingdom, is taken away and destroyed: “If a man abide not in me, he is east forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Declaring that others may take whatsoever course they may desire, the Lord’s “servant” says he has chosen that which Jehovah has for him and he delights therein. ‘His cup runneth over,’ and he drinks it with pleasure. For the faithful servant God has marked out his inheritance, both present and future. He has selected for his servant the lot or portion intended for him and he puts the measuring lines about it and they are pleasant to the servant because they place him in a position or condition of joy. Jehovah has fixed the place for his people, and no one can be in that place unless he accepts and does the will of God. Thus he proves his love for the will of God by joyfully keeping God’s commandments. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">These armies would include the resurrected saints who are now “for ever with the Lord”, and would certainly include all the holy angels of heaven that had fought with Michael when Satan was ousted from heaven. (Rev. 12:7) The faithful remnant now on earth would be counted in as a part of this heavenly army, even though their part is but to sing. They are counted from God’s viewpoint as in heavenly places. The garments worn by all the members of that mighty army identify them as fighting in a righteous cause. The remnant on earth must follow the Lamb in battle formation and be subject always to him and to his commandments. They are the ambassadors of war. They do not bear carnal weapons, but they declare God’s war message against Satan and against his organization. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 168,169</span></p>

All power in heaven and in earth is committed to him. The great event made most prominent by the New Testament is the second coming of the Lord and his kingdom. Christ Jesus is the great Judge, and to him all judgment is committed. He begins his judgment with God’s covenant people; and it is to be expected that the myriads of angels would accompany him, not as judges, but as his retinue of servants or deputies to perform the duties assigned to them. The faithful ones who have been resurrected as members of the body of Christ are doubtless performing some mission at this time, but there is no time that they are participating in judging their own brethren on earth. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">As</span><span class="font5"> the remnant of Israel was made manifest, so now the remnant of spiritual Israel is made manifest. This remnant has escaped or been brought out from and made separate from the less faithful ones who were of Jerusalem, the general organization of the Lord on earth. Hence it is written of the faithful remnant now on earth: “The remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward: for out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do this.” Booted and grounded in Christ, made separate and distinct from the world, these bear the kingdom fruits upward to the glory of Jehovah God, and continue to sing forth the praises of his name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/30</span></p>

This fact is now clearly revealed to his people, who must serve and praise Jehovah, and not honor men. ‘The hour of God’s judgment is come,’ because he is in his temple for judgment, and his people will be required to meet the rules he has laid down. This is the period of time when the world is seen worshiping Satan and his organization, and the ruling powers are compelling such worship. The faithful remnant refuse to honor and worship any part of Satan’s organization, but they are worshiping and telling the people to worship Jehovah God, who made heaven and earth and all that is therein. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 316</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The remnant have been instructed in righteousness and have taken their stand on the side of Jehovah and are joyfully obeying him. They may expect to be opposed to the very end, because the enemy will use every instrument within his power to destroy them. His most ready instrument is “the man of sin”. Remember Jesus’ words now: “He that shall endure unto the end . . . shall be saved.” The instructions the Lord’s people have been taught by his Word are sure and complete. Hold fast thereto and stand firm in the Lord; resist the wicked one and he will flee from you. The best way to resist him is to persistently and joyfully continue actively in the service and sing forth the praises of Jehovah’s name, and thus maintain your integrity with him and keep yourselves in the love of God.

In the kingdom under the royal organization there is no need of a temple. In Solomon’s temple the ark of the covenant signified the presence of Jehovah. Since Jehovah and Christ are present in the holy city, no distinct building is needed to symbolize their presence.. Christ Jesus being the direct way of approaching to Jehovah, no intermediary building is required. Jehovah and his beloved Son are the sum total of all that could be desired. This is proof, furthermore, that the 144,000 members of the royal house are of secondary importance, and not at all indispensable.

<p><span class="font5">For centuries God’s people have looked forward to the setting up of the kingdom with great expectation. When on earth Jesus spoke of the coming of the kingdom more than of any other one thing, evidently because of its greatest importance. It is the most stupendous of all things. Its birth was and is of the highest importance. As Satan recognized Jesus as God’s heir for the kingdom, and tried to kill him when he was in the flesh, even so he recognized the kingdom as his greatest enemy. He stood ready to destroy the kingdom at its beginning. Jehovah challenges him when he says: “Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth! saith Jehovah: shall I that cause to bring forth shut the womb! saith thy God.’’ (Isa. 66: 9, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font5"> Nothing could prevent the birth of his government in 1914. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 235</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“The water of life” is not limited to the “ten fundamental doctrines” set forth in the Bible, because above all of these is the great truth concerning the name of the true and living God and the vindication of his word and name. That vindication comes through his kingdom. To God’s anointed the promise is made that those who thirst shall be given of the fountain of the water of life freely. (Rev. 21:6) This “water of life” has especially been understood by God’s people since the opening of the temple in heaven. God’s flood of truth is clear and bright, like the “bright and morning star”. It began to flow after the Lord came to his temple; for then, the temple being opened, the flashes of God’s lightning began. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 254,255</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">No one can enter it who does not travel in the same course that God marked out for Jesus. Any man trying to enter the kingdom in any other way is a thief and robber, as Jesus stated. (John 10:1) Those who think they can enter God’s kingdom by separating themselves from God’s organization and God’s appointed way, and growing up into a perfect character that makes them fit for the kingdom, attempt to enter in a way different from what God pointed out; therefore Jesus’ words apply, that “the same is a thief and a robber”. Satan coveted power and authority and adulation, and sought it unlawfully. The Scriptures emphatically state that thieves and covetous creatures shall not have eternal life or enter the kingdom of heaven.

<p><span class="font5">When God purposes a thing it is as though it were already done, and it comes to pass in his own good time and way. He says: “I am God, and there is none like me. ... I have purposed it, I will also do it.” The words “intention” or “plan” admit of a possibility of a failure to accomplish what&quot; is attempted. “Purpose” means a determination to do it, and with God the purpose is equal to the accomplished fact. God never fails, and therefore the creature can always have complete and absolute confidence in him. There is but one Almighty God, and to him are all praise and glory due. When the creature knows and appreciates that Jehovah does not need a plan, his appreciation of the Most High is broadened. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/30</span></p>

That lie is anti-God and anti-kingdom, and all who are not for God and Christ and the kingdom are against them. Due to “the lie” the “man of sin” gathers with Satan’s forces against God’s kingdom at the battle of Armageddon. Laboring under that “energy of delusion” those who compose the “man of sin” are led into a course of action which furnishes the basis for God’s judgment upon them as being unworthy of life and worthy of destruction, and hence such are designated “the son of perdition”. Since judgment begins at the house of God and the “man of sin” assumes to represent God and thereby seats himself in the temple, he must have judgment pronounced on him. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/30</span></p>

When the creature reaches a point of real appreciation of the Creator he refuses thereafter to be guided by what is called policy of expediency. It may seem expedient to take one course in order to obtain a desired result, but expediency is not always a safe course for the child of God. One who really loves God will ask himself: What is the expressed will of God concerning my course?

Who can raise any reasonable objection to God’s people’s seeking an insight into all of Babylon’s or Satan’s organization and to their making these things known to the order-loving peoples of earth? All who oppose the proclamation of the message against Satan’s organization at this time aline themselves on the enemy’s side. The line is clearly drawn. Jehovah has called these things to remembrance for his purposes, and one of his purposes is that his judgments must be made known to the people and that his anointed ones must be his witnesses and thus make them known.

They have, however, even a greater appreciation than ever of the high calling and, as with Paul, their great desire is to gain the prize. Also, like him, they clearly see that the condition precedent to gaining that prize is complete obedience to God’s commandments, prompted in this by an unselfish devotion to him.

So it is written: “Until the time that she which travaileth [God’s woman] hath brought forth; then the remnant of his brethren shall return.” (Mic. 5:3) She brought forth her children in the place or condition that God had prepared for her, and then God fed them upon the food convenient for their growth.

(Heb. 1:2; Rom. 8:17) Only the overcomers are made members of the royal house. (Heb. 3:6) It is because they are overcomers that they are made members of God’s royal house. Therefore Jehovah says to them: ‘I began this message; I have brought it to a close. Your duties and obligations are before you.

The fact that Jehovah uses the Society in his work and the Society is doing his work shows that those who oppose are opposing the work of God. Zion is made up of God’s approved and anointed ones. The opposers of God’s organization presumptuously set about to build a temple and a city (which is a symbol of an organization) about which they have not received instructions from the Lord. No man or company of men has put these opposers out of God’s organization, nor could they put them out; but the opposers, by persisting in their wrongful course of action, have been gathered out by the Lord.

As God committed service of much importance to angels in relation to the Israelites, his typical people, there is every reason to believe he has done somewhat similarly respecting his people whom he has selected for his name. Due to the fact that the word “angel” also means deputy or representative, it must be true that the angels assigned by the Lord to look after the church are clothed with specific authority as God’s deputies or officers. They are sent forth to perform certain functions in behalf of the members of the body of Christ while such members are in course of preparation for the kingdom.—Heb. 1:14. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/30</span></p>

Therefore his “woman” was given two wings of his provision, his love and power, to bear her away: “I bare you on eagles’ wings, and brought you unto myself.” (Ex. 19:4) After the birth of The Nation, or kingdom, and while their witness work was in restraint during the World War, God’s saints on earth prayed: “Keep me as the apple of the eye; hide me under the shadow of thy wings.” (Ps. 17: 8) “I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever; I will trust in the covert of thy wings.” (Ps. 61:4) God’s prophet responds: “He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.’.’ And God by his truth revealed himself to his people, and his ministration to them has fed them. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 247, 248 '</span></p>

After the coming of the Lord to his temple the faithful ones were brought into the temple and the holy spirit poured out upon all, regardless of their former position or whether they were male or female, and then it became the privilege of all to do preaching. That explains why there have been more really zealous ones in the field work during the past few years than before, and also why many who claim to be in line for the kingdom have fallen away.

(Rev. 12:9) When God presented his beloved Son (the antitypical Cyrus) as King, the rulers of Babylon (in 1914-1918) rejected him and gave their allegiance and worship to Satan’s organization. That marks the time of the fall of Babylon, or casting of her out of heaven. Then God’s people are released from Babylon and go up to build up Zion. Christ, the antitypical Cyrus, builds up the temple, the people of God, and lets loose the captives. (Isa. 45:1, 13; Ps. 126:1) Before Babylon finally drinks of the wine of God’s wrath and is destroyed God is having an announcement made of her fall, and a testimony given concerning his purpose to destroy her finally at Armageddon. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 326</span></p>

Any judgment or decree made and enforced because of ill will, hatred or malice is wrong and evil. On the contrary, a judgment rendered and enforced by one possessing the rightful authority and only in the honest administration of justice is right, even though it results in suffering on the part of the one against whom the decree is enforced. Because the enforcement of a just judgment does bring suffering and affliction it is evil but is in full harmony with God’s law. When God’s kingdom is in full sway in the earth, then Christ the King and just Judge will do justly and render all decrees in justice and righteousness. All ,his judgments will be right, but they will work evil to the wicked. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/30</span></p>

The “great multitude” or those who will form that company are each brought forth as sons of God, yet at no time are any of them branches in the true vine. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christ</span><span class="font5"> means “anointed one”, and no one is truly in Christ as a branch in the true vine until he is anointed. It is the chosen and anointed ones that must now prove faithful unto death if they would be made members in the kingdom of glory. It is to this class or company that the words of Jesus concerning the vine, the branches, and the fruit, are addressed. These must have been begotten of the spirit, manifested the fruit of the spirit, and been anointed of the spirit, before they are branches in the vine. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Flesh and blood cannot enter into the kingdom as a member thereof. Nothing will be there that is in the least out of harmony with righteousness. Those who will be there have their names written in the Lamb’s book of life. The names of the faithful are written in the book of life before they leave the earth. It would seem that the writing takes place at the time of the anointing, because that is the official designation to a place in the holy city. It is reasonable to conclude that the remnant of God’s people have their names written now in the Lamb’s book of life. Whether they are blotted out or remain there will depend upon faithfulness even unto death. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 252, 253</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Every company that has withdrawn from the Society, and every person forming a part of these companies, has done so of his own volition. While disagreeing among themselves and finding no unity in God’s service, they all oppose the witness work of the Society being done in the Lord’s name and in obedience to his commandments. The opposition leaders say: ‘Let us vigorously oppose the Society and let the name of the Lord be glorified thereby.’ Their attitude and speech tend to discourage some of God’s people, and for the encouragement of these Jehovah says to them, in substance: ‘Be not discouraged; for the Lord shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.* W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/15/30</span></p>

There is no reason to conclude that the members of the church must all be in glory before the judgment begins. The reasonable construction to be placed upon the Master’s words, and which is supported by other texts, is that the Lord Jesus comes for judgment; that he comes to his temple; that he is attended by his great myriads of angels who act as his deputies or representatives to carry out his orders; that he begins judgment at the house of God, and as these are approved they are brought into the temple and made members of Zion; that after his kingdom is in full sway, then the tribes of Israel will be judged and the members of Christ’s body will participate with him in such judgment. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/30</span></p>

It is God’s remnant on the earth that receive the invitation to the supper, respond thereto, and are chosen, and because of faithfulness enter into the joy of the Lord, and begin to drink the wine of joy anew with the Lord in his kingdom. The feast must be something more than what the consecrated enjoyed before the Lord’s coming to the temple. The feast which causes rejoicing is not the restoration of the ten fundamental doctrines to the church, but the unfolding of the prophecies showing that the King is on his throne, that the kingdom has begun, and that the great privilege of knowing and serving Jehovah is here. This is a feast of joy.—Luke 12: 36,37. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 158,161</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">God’s people are called by his name. His anointed sons stand as his representatives because to them he has committed the “testimony of Jesus Christ” which they are commanded to tell If these are doing the work God has commanded them to do, then those who oppose that work and the workers are opposing God and that which is called by God’s name. Such opposition is manifested by the “evil servant”, who is “a foolish shepherd”, an “idol shepherd”. (Zech. 11:15-17) He idolizes himself and other creatures and leaves God and Christ in the background of his vision and forsakes the work which God has commanded his people to do. All features of God’s law are matters of devotion to God; whatsoever he has constituted for his purpose should have respect. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/30</span></p>

(Matt. 24:32; Gen. 8:11) Leaves afford shade and covering. They serve to purify the atmosphere and serve as medicinal remedies for the sick, and for the beauty of the landscape. The tree of life, watered constantly by the flow from the throne of God and the Lamb, is the kingdom tree. Christ, the great tree of life which Jehovah planted to supply life for mankind, shall heal and bless them. He, the Sun of righteousness, shall arise with healing in his beams.

<p><span class="font5">Those of Zion know that the glory of Jehovah is set above the heavens. The true facts concerning his purpose have heretofore been hidden even from his people; but when he builds up Zion, then he shines forth. (Ps. 102:16) “Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.” (Ps. 50: 2) Those of Zion see the works of Jehovah God and call upon his name and Proclaim his doings among the people. (Isa. 12:3-6) hese also see Satan’s organization which that one has builded up against Jehovah and his Anointed. They see that Jehovah has set his King upon his throne and will bring all things in heaven and on earth into subjection to his kingdom. Jehovah, therefore, has set his throne above all the heavens, and all things must be brought into conformity to his will. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The real purpose of bringing forth or bearing fruit is not to develop the individuals, but to bring honor or glory to Jehovah God’s name. So long as one abides in Christ, and even though he meets with many difficulties in bearing the fruit, he may ask what he will, in harmony with God’s way, with the assurance that all things shall be caused to work together for his good. (Rom. 8:28) How could one of most sweet, beautiful and pious character, as these words are generally understood, bestow any glory or honor upon Jehovah God? Surely no creature by growing to perfection could thereby glorify Jehovah. It is what the creature does in obedience to God’s commandment that brings honor and glory to God.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I press along the line, towards the prize of the high calling of God by Christ Jesus.—Phil. 3:14, Diag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The course of action is set ‘according to a line or mark’ and the faithful must pursue that course of action according to that line or “mark” in order to run lawfully and do God’s will. The line is from the beginning of the Christian’s course to the time of death and that line or course of action is marked out by the Lord himself. To each one brought into the covenant for the kingdom the course is exactly the same. The new creature is called and when he responds he then enters upon the race course and must follow that course definitely and lawfully to the end, which end comes at his death. The high calling is to the kingdom. The prize is the crown of life, and the mark is the roadway or course of action that must be followed by every one who gains the kingdom.

<p><span class="font5">The expression “thy heavens” clearly refers to the physical heavens a portion of which are visible to the eye of man. The speaker contrasts the wonders of God with man and man’s relationship to the earth. He revels in the great and marvelous things which by day man can see and which by night magnify themselves before man’s wondering gaze. The sun is the only orb of which man can take notice during the day; but when his glory is sunk into the west, and night’s curtains are drawn about the earth, then the millions of stars stand forth and sing the praise of the Almighty Creator. From the contemplation of such gigantic creation, and the greatness of the Maker thereof, the psalmist says: “What is . . . the son of man, that thou visitest him?” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus, the beloved of God, stands upon Mount Zion as harmless as a lamb to all those who work righteousness; but he is a great and terrible and destructive Warrior against God’s enemies. He is the Head and Chief of the “winepress”, which is used as a symbol to show that which destroys Satan’s wicked organization in the earth. The wine-press is trodden “without the city”, which means outside of the holy city, which is God’s organization; ‘for outside are dogs, sorcerers, fornicators, murderers, idolaters and liars.’ (Rev. 22:15) The children of God are commanded to keep away from such. (1 Cor. 5:11-13) The treading down outside the city therefore shows the complete crushing of everything that is opposed to God’s organization. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 343</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.—Heb. 5:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No one has by the practice and carrying on of evil learned any valuable lesson concerning the sinfulness of sin, and only the Christian, in spite of sin and the practice of evil, has proven his devotion to God. Therefore the Christian, by the things that he suffers, learns obedience even as Jesus learned. Surely Jesus learned nothing from the practice of evil by others, yet he learned obedience by the things he suffered. From God’s Word the Christian knows that sin is the transgression of God’s law, and therefore wrong, and when he suffers wrong at others’ hands such suffering is not in order to teach him the exceeding sinfulness of sin but does afford him an opportunity to prove his loyalty, faithfulness and devotion to God amidst persecution.

The faithful were eager to obey that commandment and did obey it. Those who fell away then and since have rebelled against God’s organization and opposed the world-wide witness service to the name of Jehovah and concerning his vengeance against Satan’s organization. They have not been content to remain inactive, but have busied themselves in open opposition to the work being done in obedience to God’s commandments. As it was in Paul’s day, even so like conditions have existed after the Lord came to his temple: “For a great and effective door has been opened . . . • yet there are many opposers.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/30</span></p>

Both of these are living, going concerns, and going strong at the time of the battle of Armageddon. The Lord arrests or captures these wicked and oppressive organizations alive and hurls them “alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone”. This means that God will completely destroy them while in their pomp and glory and power. They could have gone on indefinitely except for the exercise of God’s power through Christ.

<p><span class="font5">There was a remnant of the nation of Israel that remained faithful to God. It was that remnant that came to a knowledge of the truth during Jesus’ earthly ministry and at Pentecost and shortly thereafter. That remnant of Israel foreshadowed the remnant of the consecrated who are on earth particularly at the end of the world. These are in the covenant for the kingdom and they are bearing the kingdom fruits to the Lord’s glory. Those who will continue to diligently perform their covenant to the end will receive, according to the Lord’s promise, an abundant entrance into his everlasting kingdom.

In response to the cries of his oppressed people God expresses his righteous indignation against the oppressor, and is therefore called the military God, or Lord of sabaoth. Jehovah fought for his people Israel, and will fight for those of his organization in his own due time. With equal certainty the Scriptures say that Jehovah will bless his people with peace. His kingdom will bring peace to the peoples of earth only after the greatest of all wars, and the peace then established shall continue forever. Only when creatures do contrary to Jehovah’s law does it become necessary for him, in his own due time and way, to make war upon them. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">He that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power.—Rev. 20:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This statement being made in connection with the binding of Satan in death, the inference may be properly drawn therefrom that Satan is to die the second time. By way of contrast it shows that the faithful ones shall not die the second time or in the second death. These faithful ones are blessed beyond the danger of the second death. They are granted immortality, which only God has and which he gives to the Christ. This class have resisted Satan to the end and stedfastly held their integrity, and there is no further question about their continuing in faithfulness and obedience unto God, and Satan shall not again come to them. Satan, dead in the abyss, is to be released a “little season”, and then die the second time; but not so with God’s faithful ones. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 199</span></p>

The name Cyrus means “sun”; he was used by the Lord to picture the “Sun of righteousness”. That which was of paramount importance in rebuilding the temple was to show to the people that Jehovah is the only God, besides whom there is none, and that this would result beneficially to his creatures. Only a small number of the Jews, comparatively speaking, returned to Jerusalem under the order of Cyrus. These began the rebuilding of the temple. God encouraged those commissioned to rebuild the temple as long as they carried out his orders in his appointed way. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15/30</span></p>

It is God who will reconcile the people to himself. (2 Cor. 5:17,18) There shall be an entirely new world. “For behold, I [Jehovah] create new heavens, and a new earth.” (Isa. 65:17) To the remnant Jehovah gives anew the wine of good cheer and joy. (Matt. 26:29) He establishes the New Jerusalem. He inaugurates the new covenant with the true Israelites. (Heb. 8:8-13) Then he gives a new heart to the people who love and obey him and everything is made to the good of creation and to the glory of God.

<p><span class="font5">From time to time there have befallen the peoples of earth great calamities in the way of storms, hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, floods and fires, and the like. Since there would be no occasion or reason for Jehovah to bring such disasters upon the people, the one responsible therefor must be Satan. Since God overthrew Israel, his typical people, there is no evidence that he has brought calamities or been responsible for the calamities that have befallen the peoples of the earth. On the contrary, the Scriptures point out that he abides his own good time to bring on the great battle of God Almighty which will completely and for ever vindicate his name.

The time is here to proclaim the Word and name and the glory of Jehovah God, that the people may have an opportunity to take their stand on his side and live. Satan’s organization is about to fall. Not all of the anointed ones hear and understand at the same time. Those first hearing tell their fellow servants, therefore it is written: “Let him that heareth say, Come.” This is a commandment from the Lord, and “blessed are they that do his commandments”.

Satan will use every means within his power to turn the faithful away from the Lord’s work. His most effective instrument in so doing will be &quot;the man of sin’’. Such an instrument used by Satan employs fair speech, fraud and deception, and makes great claims to love for God, while at the same time slandering his work and the workers. Those remaining faithful to the Lord will not and cannot be deceived. They must, however, with perseverance and faithfulness continue the work of singing forth Jehovah’s praises.

<p><span class="font5">Those who seek knowledge and understanding in God’s appointed way will find it. Trusting in the shed blood of Jesus as the price of man’s redemption, the one who seeks knowledge will make an agreement to do the will of God. That means consecration. The man thus entering into a covenant with God and then doing his best to perform his part of that covenant or agreement will get understanding. When God begets or brings forth one in Christ as his son he gives that one his spirit. To such are the prophet’s words addressed: &quot;Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. ’’ Those honestly endeavoring so to do have the spirit of God, and by his spirit God reveals to them his purposes. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 7</span></p>

And so it is that practice, and much of it, is required; and constancy in the witness work is a thing essential. Only those who do the required practice are pictured in this group of singers. That explains why there is a remnant that really earnestly and faithfully does the work of making the Word and name of Jehovah known. And they must learn the text of that song, and the harmony; and this they do by making use of the “meat in due season”, which by the grace of God is provided for the remnant. That meat in due season is the illumination and publication of his Word of truth from time to time. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 310</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“The kingdom of heaven is at hand.” “The day of vengeance of our God” must be declared. The truth must be told concerning the enemy and his organization, and a testimony must be given to the supremacy and honor of God and his holy name. It is the time for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. The testimony of this God gave to his beloved Son. To the anointed remnant on earth there has been committed a work to deliver this testimony, and those who love God will now keep his commandments and give the testimony regardless of all opposition. Such is the great work that must now be done and which was foreshadowed by Elisha. Those having the spirit of Elisha now joyfully engage in that work. Such is the work which the Society is now doing by the grace of God. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The reward is not given according to one’s feeling or according to one’s thoughts; but each one is rewarded according to his works. It would necessarily follow then that any who claimed to be in the covenant with the Lord and who remained idle and indifferent and failed or refused to have any part in the Lord’s service by advertising his King and kingdom at this time would receive an adverse judgment. Jehovah has commanded that the remnant shall now be entirely devoted to him and prove faithful unto the end. The final reward will now depend upon absolute faithfulness. These are privileged to stand in the light of the Lord’s glory and to have clearly marked out to them the course of action that God would have them take.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Go thou and preach the kingdom of God.—Luke 9:60.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every one of the kingdom class must preach the gospel. The majority of such preach the glad tidings by carrying the message of the kingdom in book form to the people. If the books were simply the scheme of men, then the followers of Christ Jesus should have nothing to do with them. If the books contain the message of God’s kingdom, that message is not man’s, but Jehovah’s message. It is his truth, and hence constitutes the fruit of his kingdom. If you believe such is true, then do not permit the enemy to beat down your courage or to cause you to slack your hand in preaching the gospel. Go and put the message of truth in the people’s hands, that they may know who is the true and Almighty God. The more the gospel is preached by one, the more that one honors or glorifies the name of Jehovah. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font5"> voice symbolically represents a harmonious message. Since the Lord’s coming to the temple and the assembling of the temple class and bringing them into their position in Zion, there has gone forth and continues to go forth a great harmonious witness of the truth by those whom the Lord God has gathered and approved. At Jericho Joshua was fully aware of the presence of invisible angelic hosts, yet he went straight forward with his orders. He caused the sounding of the trumpet and the shouting. Even so now, the faithful ones know that the Lord and his myriads of angels are present and that the latter are acting as their body guard and doing a work under the direction of the King. Yet they, the members of Zion on earth, must do their part, singing Jehovah’s praises. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The man child is God’s kingdom, new nation or government under Christ that must ride all of earth’s nations. It is only Jehovah who could create the kingdom and from whom proceeds all power and authority. Inasmuch as he willed the righteous government and its manner of birth, his great organization served as the mother and furnished the material for such government to be born and to rule all nations. God’s entire or universal organization gives birth to the new government, but it is his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“elect”</span><span class="font5"> servant or great “high priest” that rules. (Ps. 110:4) The woman of God’s organization therefore gave birth to the kingdom, to those composing the kingdom, to wit, Christ at his resurrection, and the members of his body later, and to the office which The Christ fills. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 235, 236</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Keeping his works “unto the end” must mean unto the end which comes after ‘this gospel of the kingdom has been preached to all the world for a witness’. Inasmuch as the church is now in the time in which the members thereof have a glimpse of the immediate future, may not the above words of Jesus indicate that the overcoming remnant will be permitted to see Satan’s organization dashed to pieces and during that time and even thereafter have some work on the earth to the glory of the name of Jehovah? The overcomers are also told that they shall have a position of honor with the “morning star”, evidently meaning with Christ in glory. And now for the encouragement of all the faithful remnant on the earth the Lord is revealing these truths to them. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 34</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This text would denote that the work that was marked out to be done must be completed before reporting to headquarters. In substance the picture says: ‘The work must be done and those assigned to the work must keep it up until not one vestige of the enemy is left. ’ That would mean that whatsoever part is assigned to the remnant on earth to do, they too must do it, and not stop until the work is accomplished to the glory of God. (Isa. 6:11,12) The fact that God’s people on earth do their part of this work and that the purpose thereof is understood by them is of itself proof that those of the servant class on earth are directed by the Lord through his angels. This fact should be of great comfort to the Lord’s people. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 19</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This is the voice of Jehovah’s judgment against Satan and his organization. This voice out of heaven said, “It is done.” Other translations render the text in this manner: “Accomplished!” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> “All is over.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Moff.)</span><span class="font5"> Probably the meaning is: The issue is now finally joined and must be determined at Armageddon. It has come to pass that God’s purposes against Satan and his organization are made manifest. The outpouring of the plagues is now an accomplished fact.

So now God’s people must publish the message just before the fall and destruction of the great antitypical city of Babylon the great. (Isa. 21:6-10) God reveals to his people the information of things that must shortly come to pass, and the fact that he shows it to them before or in advance implies that they must tell it out to others. (Isa. 42:9) That means a tremendous and widespread witness that must be given by God’s anointed witnesses, and this they must continue to do and declare ‘until the city be wasted without an inhabitant’.— Isa. 6:11. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 120</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">God gave Jesus the title “Faithful and True Witness”, not because Jesus developed a character, but because he was wholly faithful in performing his commission received from Jehovah. He was always perfect. He received the high reward because of his faithfulness. Paul was given a dispensation, stewardship or commission, to wit, the preaching of the gospel of God’s kingdom, and especially to carry that message to the Gentiles. He stated he must do that work voluntarily, joyfully and faithfully if he would receive a reward. He must follow exactly in Jesus’ footsteps and be a witness for God and for Christ.

<p><span class="font5">The administration of the holy spirit, or helper, is in behalf of and for the benefit of all who have responded to the call and who are in line for the kingdom. It seems reasonable to say that, when that administration of the holy spirit is completed, it is taken away, just as the “gifts” of the spirit were taken away. Those once in fine for the kingdom but who were rejected and not chosen have now no advocate, helper or comforter and are left to the open attack of the enemy Satan; for the withholding, letting or restraining power, to wit, the holy spirit, is withdrawn from those who go to make up the “evil servant”, and Satan, it seems, will organize them into an opposition work against God and his anointed. Jesus is not the advocate for these workers of iniquity. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It is the “servant” with which Jehovah is now dealing, and Christ Jesus stands for the “servant” in his entirety. It is written: “Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect! It is God that justifieth.” Jehovah is the One that approves or judges his servant. When the temple class is gathered the administration of the holy spirit as an advocate, it seems, would be at an end. If one is of the remnant, chosen and anointed, then he is in the secret place of the Most High. By reason of being in Christ and under the special supervision of the Head of the temple, Christ Jesus is his sole advocate. As long as the chosen one abides in the temple he is in the secret place of the Most High and therefore in the place of security. —Ps. 91:1-11. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/30</span></p>

To all such the call to the kingdom is given. Some respond to the call, but many do not; as Jesus has stated: &quot;Many are called, but few are chosen.” Those who have responded to the call and continued faithful and were chosen received the anointing as members of the body of Christ, some receiving it before the Lord came to his temple, and the more general outpouring of the holy spirit taking place at the time the Lord came to his temple. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/30</span></p>

They must now take an active part in the Lord’s service in telling of God and his kingdom through Christ. It is upon these that the Lord’s spirit is poured out, and those receiving the spirit &quot;shall prophesy”. (Joel 2:28,29) God has spoken, and his faithful servants must prophesy. (Amos 3:8) These constitute the &quot;feet” of Christ, who must now deliver the message. (Isa. 52:7,8) And in giving this testimony the remnant is not to honor the creature, but to give all honor and glory to the Creator. It is God’s name and word that must now be vindicated.

<p><span class="font5">The Master said: “Every branch in me that bear-eth not fruit he taketh away. He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit.’’ The word “bear’’ as used concerning the fruit does not mean to produce or grow fruit. It means to carry, to uphold, to move, and to bring forth and serve. The word is used exactly as the expression “bring forth”. Concerning the same fruit, the words of Jesus are these: “The kingdom of God shall be . . . given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.” Without a question of doubt Jesus there referred to the same fruits as mentioned in the parable of the true vine, and thus lays down the rule that those who will be of and possess the kingdom are the ones that bring forth the fruits thereof and that no one can be of the kingdom who does not bring forth or bear the fruits thereof. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The purpose of the kingdom of God is that the Word and name of God may be fully and completely vindicated. Everything else is merely incidental thereto. God gave his word that he would bring forth a “seed” that would stedfastly hold to a course of faithfulness with him and that such seed he would use to eliminate wickedness from the universe and to establish righteousness. Satan emphatically denied that God could do such a thing, and reproached God’s name for so stating. Therefore Satan put the question at issue which must be decided in due time. To accomplish his purpose God sent Jesus to earth to be his representative and witness. He marked out the course Jesus should take. Jesus blazed the way. We must follow therein. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1/30</span></p>

Since then he has made known to his people the things that must come to pass speedily, and therefore his ‘coming quickly’ now must mean that very speedily the great battle of the day of God Almighty will be fought and the name of Jehovah be vindicated. The time is indeed short, and there is much to be done. The remnant must be busy. It is a most wonderful and blessed privilege to have some part in giving the witness concerning the vindication of God’s name.

Jehovah has sent his earthly witnesses to give testimony to the rulers, that Christendom may have no excuse. God does nothing in secret or in a corner.

Their combined efforts in trying to act in one organization results in a “voice of noise from the city’’ (symbolic of an organization).

Jehovah loves his children and he shows them the enemy, that they may be safeguarded from his subtle attacks. When one sees a snake in his way he avoids it or tries to kill it. In the vision which God gave to his beloved Son to show to his servant class on earth he shows them the enemy and his activities, that the faithful may avoid the enemy’s thrust and fight against it. (Rev. 16:13-16) Satan is invisible to human eyes; but God gives his children spiritual discernment, that they may see the enemy and his machinations.

God’s Word is now a light unto the temple class. “The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light.” (Isa. 60:19) In the “holy city” Jehovah’s presence floods it with light and glory, because “God is light”. He dwells in the light unto which no human creature can approach. (1 Tim. 6:16) Jesus too is a lamp or illumination to the holy city.

Let them do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly before God. To “walk humbly” means to be joyfully obedient to God’s commandments. Regardless of what others may say, do not be turned away from a whole-hearted devotion to God and his service. The greatest privilege of any creatures ever on earth is that now enjoyed by the anointed of the Lord.

<p><span class="font5">This “the man of sin” does by putting himself above what God’s commandments require. He puts himself above Jesus Christ in exempting himself from being God’s witness. Jesus was and is “the faithful and true witness” of Jehovah, and has committed a portion of the testimony to his faithful followers and commands them to go forth and give witness. The opposers set themselves up above Jesus Christ, refuse to obey the commandments and to bear the reproaches that came upon Jesus. They refuse to be “subject unto the Higher Powers”, to wit, Jehovah and Jesus and the inspired apostles who set forth God’s commandments to his people.

Organized Christianity, so called, is full of filthiness. No child of God can associate with or touch this filthy organization with which Satan has reproached Jehovah’s name.

Instead of the servant’s being moved into action by the operation of the holy spirit as a helper, the Scriptures seem to teach clearly that the Lord directs his angels what to do and that they act under the supervision of the Lord in directing the remnant on earth concerning the course of action to take.—Rev. 8:1-7.

<p><span class="font5">How can a Christian bear or bring forth fruits of the kingdom t The Scriptural answer is, By obeying the commandments of God to preach the gospel of the kingdom. The commission that Jehovah bestows upon all who are brought into the body of Christ is to preach the gospel of the kingdom. (Isa. 61:1-3) These must (1) preach or bring forth the fruits of the kingdom to those who are of Zion and who are God’s people. These need the life-sustaining substance, the fruit of the kingdom of God, and it is the privilege and duty of those anointed in Christ to carry this fruit to one another. Hence by love they are serving one another. (2) The anointed are commissioned to tell the good news of the kingdom to all who are teachable and who desire to be taught. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Arrogantly the “man of sin”, or “evil servant”, exalts himself as the anointed of God, and claims to be the “little flock”, and assumes to be God’s representatives, and claims to be the temple class, and thereby seats himself in the temple. Even in Paul’s day some who had responded to the call looked forward to when they might have the power of the kingdom for their selfish purposes. They were workers of iniquity. Because the holy spirit was then operating in behalf of all responding to the call, that holy power held back the enemy Satan from organizing the opposition and bringing forth the “man of sin”. That restraining power being taken away when the Lord comes to his temple, then the “wicked one” is quickly organized, begins the opposition to God and his anointed, and is revealed as the “son of destruction”.—2 Thess. 2: 3. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Each one of these is a “pearl of great price”, and doubtless means that every one who enters at those gates and becomes a part of the holy city must first sell everything that he has that he might enjoy the Messed privilege of entering the glorious organization. (Matt. 13:46) The beautiful gates also symbolically say: ‘Everyone who enters here will sing the praise of Jehovah God.’ “Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.” (Ps. 100:4) “Praise ye the Lord: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely.’’—Ps. 147:1. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 248</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The servant and apostle John was the last survivor of all those who wrote under inspiration. He used the words “bear witness”, “testify” and “testimony” more than any other New Testament writer. To bear witness was his chief theme and work. By the Lord’s grace John foreshadowed the faithful remnant who have tarried or remained unto the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to his temple. Upon such ‘God has bestowed his extraordinary grace and mercy’, which the name John signifies. When John wrote The Revelation, he was in banishment on the Isle of Patmos because he had testified to God’s Word. The remnant is now in banishment by being ostracized from all others of earth because of their unswerving devotion to God and the giving of testimony to his name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 11</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">To “bless the Lord” denotes the act of worship and adoration and a humble and joyful obedience of the “servant” to his Lord and Master. The spirit of the Lord instructs and gives counsel to the faithful sons of God. This counsel comes to them by reason of being enabled to understand and appreciate God’s Word. Through the Lord’s goodness arrangements are made to give such counsel to his church, whereby the “servant” class understands Jehovah’s purposes and also appreciates the great privilege of having a part in his service. No one upon whom the holy spirit rests is found complaining and murmuring against the Lord’s service. To the faithful God gives counsel and directs how his service shall be done, and such praise and adore Jehovah for this great privilege.

<p><span class="font5">Those who walk in the street of the holy city would walk along the banks of the river of the water of life. The water of life is flowing only in the way of God’s kingdom for mankind. The river of water is shown as starting in the city and flowing along to the walls, the limits of the city, and then on to the outside so that those who are not members of God’s organization or “holy city” may also avail themselves of the opportunity of the blessings that come from this great fountain of truth. Jehovah is the great source of light and life. He is the planter of the tree of life, which represents the provisions he has made for those who will come to him and live. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt 11, 256, 257</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The name “Judas” is the same as the Hebrew name “Judah”, and means “praise” unto God. Judas first sang praises unto Jehovah and then drew back and put himself in opposition. Judas Iscariot had been for some time the servant of the Lord Jesus. Among the twelve servants of Jesus Christ Judas became an evil servant and lost all opportunity for the kingdom, about which Jesus had taught him, and to which doubtless he had been called. Jesus declared that Judas was lost, and he named him “the son of perdition”. The prophecy written in Psalm 109 Judas fulfilled at least in miniature, but it seems that this prophecy must have a complete fulfilment in “the day of Christ”. (Acts 1:20) There is no good reason to conclude that ‘the man of sin, the son of perdition’, is now one individual creature. Rather he is the “evil servant” class. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It is the exclusive right of Jehovah to delegate authority to others to render judgment. It is wrong for any one to render or to attempt to render and to enforce against others a judgment or decree that would result in evil, unless the person so rendering such judgment or decree has full authority &quot;thus to do. It is therefore clearly seen that evil or punishment administered without authority is wrong, whereas evil resulting from a judgment made or enforced by the rightful authority is right and proper. Any judgment or decree that is made, rendered and enforced contrary to God’s law is therefore wrong and evil. At once it becomes apparent that to know God and his law is of paramount importance, and then it becomes necessary to obey him.

<p><span class="font5">God gave the holy and obedient angels a distinctive service in connection with the Israelites. The words used by Paul as quoted above show that God’s word of authority to the Israelites was spoken to them by the angels and was stedfast and firm and that their disobedience thereto received a just recompense. This showed that the angels had something to do with it and that God confirmed it. A great obligation rested upon the Israelites to heed the words of their covenant with God, but upon those who have accepted Christ there now rests even a greater obligation. The latter must give earnest heed to the requirements of the covenant by sacrifice, if they would attain the great salvation that has come to light by and through Jesus’ death and resurrection. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">From the time of the crisis or judgment that begins when the Lord comes to his temple those are “blessed” who remain firm, true, steadfast, and wholly devoted to God. The “dead” here mentioned are not those who are unconscious, but those wholly dedicated to God and who are therefore “dead with Christ” and whose lives are hid by Jehovah with Christ. These at the moment of actual death are raised again to life. The spirit of Jehovah emphasizes the blessedness of those continuing faithful, with the word “Yea”. ‘They rest from their labors.’ This does not mean inactivity; but it means a cessation from toil and that their trouble ends. They are not idle now, but are earnestly engaged in the Father’s business. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 332, 333</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It is the time of crucial test for the remnant. The temple class must meet the test and prove their loyalty and faithfulness even unto death. It is therefore of paramount importance to the remnant to be energetic and faithful in keeping God’s commandments. They are made the witnesses of Jehovah and have the kingdom interests on earth committed to them. Never in the existence of the church was it so essential as now that the anointed walk humbly before God, and with fear and trembling, and thus work out their salvation. These must do God’s will from the heart, having an honest, sincere devotion to him. They must be perfected in love, and this perfection comes only by faithful service to him.—Eph. 6; 6; 1 John 4:17,18. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 277</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">God sent forth the holy spirit to act in behalf of all his sons who had responded to the call for the kingdom and during Jesus’ absence from the earth. During all that period of time “the mystery of iniquity” was at work, and had it not been for the restraining power of the holy spirit “the man of sin” would have been manifested much sooner. With the Lord’s coming to his temple there was no further need for the administration of the holy spirit as a comforter or advocate. The Elijah work was done and the spirit’s administration in the capacity of helper was finished. The due time for “that wicked” to be revealed was after the beginning of the Elisha work of the church. The spirit of God no longer hinders Satan, who brings forth the lawless “man of sin”, and he begins his opposition to God and his work.

Creatures may do some work on the Lord’s house, but they must do it in God’s appointed way, otherwise it will be rejected. Jehovah by his chief executive officer assembles the material and erects the structure. God’s house or temple is made up of his chosen and anointed ones. No man can put another into that temple, and no man can take one out of it. The Scriptures give us to expect that Satan would attempt a counterfeit of God’s house and that some would be drawn into such a movement and become opposers of Jehovah because they have not received the “love of the truth”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The mystery of God is not the same as the “mystery of Christ”. The mystery of God is concerning Jehovah’s organization and that organization which opposes God and which the Lord will destroy. There are a number of questions relating to Jehovah which were a mystery to God’s people and which have been cleared up since the Lord’s coming to his temple. Who is God? What is the significance of the names by which he reveals himself? Is God responsible for all the sorrows and woes of earth, including the calamities? Has he an organization, and what is it? What is the organization that opposes him, and of what does it consist ? All these things God had long ago foretold by his prophets; but the time must come for them to be understood by his faithful people on the earth.

(Gal. 5:19-21) The truth received into a good and honest heart engenders unselfishness, love, and ‘brings forth fruit with patience’. (Luke 8:15) If one has not a good and honest heart, which means a pure and unselfish motive, the truth could not develop in </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5"> the fruit of the spirit, which is love. He does not therefore receive “the love of the truth”. Those who receive the truth and also the love of the truth, and who hold that love of the truth, have the fruit of the spirit. Such prove their love for God, the Author of all truth, by gladly keeping his commandments.

What he means is this: That we now see that the day draws near for the complete establishment of the kingdom; we have come to Zion, hence there must be complete unity amongst those who are the Lord’s; they must take their stand unwaveringly on the Lord’s side and stand firm for him in this evil day; they must be his faithful and true witnesses, and, seeing eye to eye the great truths concerning the kingdom, they will joyfully join together in witnessing thereto.

It is those who have been taken into the covenant with Christ whom Paul addresses and to whom he says: ‘ ‘ Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.” Such have a specific promise that if they suffer with Christ Jesus and continue faithful to the end they shall be heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ Jesus, who is the heir of all things.

(Isa. 59:14) But when Jehovah by his mighty Officer is treading out the grapes of the terrible, wicked &quot;vine”, the treaders will rejoice and be glad because the time has come for truth and righteousness to triumph.

God has made his organization. Of this organization there is a part on earth to which is delegated certain work to be done. All who are of God’s organization are responsible and answerable to him.

And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.” (Matt. 24:11-13) There are two important things concerning which the remnant dare not permit themselves to be deceived, to wit, (1) The coming of the Lord Jesus to his temple; and (2) &quot;our gathering together unto him”.

(Neh. 13:19) When the kingdom of righteousness rules in full sway “the rulers of the darkness” will have been disposed of and there would be no need for the closing of the gates.

(Heb. 7:3-16) Jesus has myriads of angels who have always been faithful, but they have not the same relationship to him as the overcomers. These, made members of his body, shall be his favored or confidential servants and with him be servants of Jehovah God forever. The thousand-year reign is limited to things pertaining to the earth.

They did not receive the double portion of Elijah’s spirit that was to come and did come upon those represented by Elisha. Hence they have refused to do the Elisha work and go even further in an open opposition to it. Satan having been cast out of heaven and to the earth and being no longer restrained by the operation of the holy spirit as advocate, this shield to the called ones is taken away, and Satan enters into the lawless one as he did into Judas. “The man of sin” carries out Satan’s scheme of opposition to God’s work. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/30</span></p>

The call means an invitation, that is, an invitation to the kingdom which will vindicate Jehovah’s name. Jesus was the first one called and he was called after he was begotten at the Jordan. Others are called and they too must receive the call after having been brought forth as the sons of God. The high calling is to the kingdom, the seat of which is in heaven, and therefore it is a call to a high or heavenly place.

Since the building up of Zion he has appeared in his glory, and by his lightnings has revealed himself, his organization, and his purposes, to his people as never before. He has made clear to them many prophecies that have been fulfilled, and now gives them a gleam of other things that are shortly to be fulfilled. The time has come for them to sing, and they do “sing unto the Lord a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth ’ ’. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 308</span></p>

From the creation of man to the present time God has used his faithful angels to execute his commands. It is but reasonable that God would have them present at the general assembly. The last members of the church oh earth see that the kingdom has come and that they are approaching the hour for the kingdom to be in full operation. They learn that the faithful and true angels are performing some functions in connection with that great assembly and that they will be there; that the members of the glorified Christ will be there under the leadership of their great Head, Christ Jesus; and, above all, Jehovah God will be present.

<p><span class="font5">Armageddon symbolically represents God’s mountain, that is to say, Mount Zion, his organization which, he has built up and at which he appears; therefore Satan is directing all his forces against God’s organization. It is against the Lord’s troops that Satan makes war; therefore saith the Lord, “Now gather thyself in troops, 0 daughter of troops; he hath laid siege against us.” (Alic. 5:1) Jehovah’s earthly troops are in a place of safety, because they are “in the secret place of the Most High”; and if they abide there and continue to sing forth his praises they are safe. All nations shall be gathered against God’s holy people to battle. The battle is fought at the symbolic place called “Armageddon”, because that is the place of the assembly of God’s troops, Victory to the Lord is certain. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 55, 56</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: not rendering evil for evil.—1 Pet. 3:8,9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Is the Christian ever justified in employing evil in his action toward another? Due to a proper understanding of the meaning of evil, as that which brings adversity, affliction, distress or sorrow, and is hurtful, the answer to the question must be in the negative. Under no circumstance is the Christian justified in employing evil against another. &quot;Recompense to no man evil for evil.” Evil is properly administered against wrongdoers by the Lord or by anyone whom he delegates to act in his behalf, but it would be wrong for anyone to assume to act without authority. God has not delegated power and authority to Christ’s followers to administer punishment to others even though they are wrongdoers. God will attend to them in his own good time and way. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s servant class is determined to continue faithfully devoted to the Lord’s service, regardless of all opposition. Jesus Christ, the Head of the servant class, when on earth, even though hard pressed by the enemy, always had the full assurance of his Father’s loving protection. That is also true of the body members now on earth, in these times of peril and when the enemy attempts their destruction. They confidently say of Jehovah: &quot;He is my refuge, and my fortress; my God; in him will I trust.” All the faithful members of the remnant class on earth appreciate their blessed relationship with the Lord Jehovah and are therefore determined that they will permit nothing to shake them. They resolve to maintain their integrity with the Lord, and do so. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/15/30</span></p>

The peoples of earth depend on some kind of lamp for illumination by night, and on the sun by day. No such illumination will be needed in the holy city. Now God’s Word is a light to his people on earth; but when these become members of the holy city, each with a glorious spirit organism, they will see face to face and even as they are seen by the Lord.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The fruit of the spirit is love.—Gal. 5: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In order to be faithful, those begotten and anointed of the holy spirit must be perfect in love, that is to say, must devote themselves wholly to Jehovah and support his cause and do his service and do it unselfishly. It is God’s holy spirit operating in the creature that develops love in him and therefore results in the fruit or outgrowth of the spirit. He who is unselfishly devoted to God is in the joy of the Lord and has the peace of God. He suffers long and yet maintains his confidence and his integrity to God; he is gentle and manifests goodness and much faith; he is meek, or teachable, and is temperate, or exercises self-control. But none of those things are the fruits of the kingdom. The life-sustaining substance of God’s Word of truth constitutes the fruits of the kingdom which the child of God must bear or bring forth and serve to others.

<p><span class="font5">It seems certain that when Jesus came to his temple and began his work of judgment he would direct his holy angels to take the necessary action to cause the separation of the disapproved from the approved ones, and would use his angels to bear messages to them to direct the approved ones as to what to do. (Matt. 13:41) It is the power and authority proceeding from Jehovah God by and through Christ Jesus to accomplish this work; but the angels are there for this purpose, and it is not the demonstration of the paraclete or holy spirit as a helper that directs men to do the separating work. If the holy spirit as a helper were directing the work, then there would be no good reason for employing the angels. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This penalty would fall upon anyone who is now of the remnant but who would in any manner become unfaithful. It would apply to anyone who is in line for a place in the holy city or kingdom of God. God’s commandments that stand out distinctly and that are of paramount importance at this time are these: ‘Ye are my witnesses that I am God; go and tell the people that Jehovah is God, Christ is King, and all opposers of his kingdom shall shortly fall at Armageddon; this good news go and preach to the nations as a witness. ’ Therefore let no one now attempt to take away from this prophecy by minimizing the importance of the witness work in the earth. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 287</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah does not busy himself with those who </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">are </span><span class="font5">obstinate, become offended and lawless and go out of the way. If anyone does not appreciate Jehovah, and delight to serve him it is that one’s misfortune. Nor would it be the work of the great and mighty King, Christ Jesus, to do the direct work of shaking such out. Those who are a hindranee to the Lord’s work and purpose are taken away, and Jesus declares that that work is committed to the angels who exercise their authority and power received from the Lord in so doing. No man can take another man away from the Lord and his work, but clearly the angels do have such a mission of authority from Jehovah God by and through Christ Jesus. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">When one becomes a child of God he is brought out of the darkness of the world and it is his privilege and duty to proceed thereafter in the light. To walk in the light, one must reflect the light he receives from Jehovah through Christ Jesus. He reflects this light by his consistent course of action in righteousness and his telling others of God’s gracious purposes through Christ for mankind. He must therefore be a witness for Jehovah and tell the people, not of man’s greatness and goodness, but of the greatness and loving-kindness of Jehovah God. Such witnessing to Jehovah’s name and purpose is not to get men into heaven for Jehovah’s use, but to let the truth be known that men might learn the way to life everlasting and that God’s word and name might be vindicated. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 8</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The time for the marriage of the Lamb came when Jesus appeared at his temple; and then and there the rejoicing began and all of the temple class honor and praise the Lord of hosts, and this they do by singing forth the honor of his name. That would mean that the faithful saints had been resurrected and united with the Lord Jesus in heavenly glory, hence the time for them to begin singing the great song of praise. Those constituting the remnant are examined, approved and brought into the temple; and these, seeing that the time of the union with the King has come, arise and hurry to meet the Bridegroom, and they join in the song to Jehovah’s praise. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 153, 155</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“That wicked” one does not have ‘the spirit of power, and of love, and of a sound mind’ that proceeds from God. (2 Tim. 1:7) He has the enemy’s power. Satan uses all his power against the remnant, and by “signs and lying wonders” he deceives many. The wicked or lawless ones seek to cause division among God’s faithful witnesses, and in so doing they employ Satan’s methods: “For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly [selfish interests]; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.” (Rom. 16:17,18) The Lord through his apostle warns his witnesses to avoid such because they are deadly enemies working with slyness and subtlety, like unto Satan.

He bends every effort to please the Lord. He must pursue such a lawful course if he would be crowned. “No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.” (2 Tim. 2:4,5) Such complete devotion to God shows perfect love for him; it is a pure heart condition and an entire devotion to Jehovah.

<p><span class="font5">The spirit of prophecy still lives with Jehovah and expresses itself according to his will. The Revelation is included in his prophecies. To the holy angels he committed the privilege of carrying his message of prophecy to men, and now he is pleased to use his angels to show his anointed ones what is necessary to be done speedily. This is no time for quibbling. It is no time for negligence, indifference or idleness.

His enemies seized upon this fact to charge him with treason to their own government. He was in time confronted with this charge, and then he declared that he was the king but that at that time his mission on earth was to bear witness to the truth concerning the kingdom. Thus he emphasized the fact that every one who will be of the kingdom must first be a witness to the truth of and concerning the kingdom. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/30</span></p>

The follower of Christ must see to it that his course of conduct is right, pure, just and honest before God and man, and then without fear he must tell the truth as it is set forth in God’s Word.

His fury is manifested against the vine bringing forth the wild grapes (Isa. 5:1, 2), but now no fury is in him against his wine vineyard that is “in that day”. God declares that if anyone attempts to injure his wine vineyard he will go through them and bum them: “Who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle?

It shows that the provision for life is never-failing and that there is always an abundant supply. The fruits are borne for the benefit of those who need sustenance. The fruit is that which Jehovah’s servants bring forth to serve to others needing God’s gracious provision. The kingdom is given to those that bring forth the fruits thereof. (Matt. 21:43) This does not mean fruits of one’s own self, but the fruits that God’s kingdom supplies.

As the Lord brought evil by way of punishment upon Israel, so he brings chastisements upon his sons in Christ who are negligent and forget the terms of their covenant. God is not responsible for their negligence. As he saw Israel going wrong and chastised them, so he permits chastisements upon his sons that they might learn to be obedient to him and the value of being faithful to him.

Unquestionably a mere knowledge of the truth is not sufficient to save anyone. There must be a joyful obedience to the truth. The Devil surely knows much of the truth.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And he that is holy, let him be hallowed stHl,—Rev. 22:11, Roth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The holy Jerusalem is the bride of Christ, the Lamb’s wife, the organization which God has prepared for his beloved Son. Every one of that organization must be holy. None other ean enter into that city or be a part thereof. Those brought forth as sons of God in Christ by and through the covenant of sacrifice are called to membership in this holy city. Only a small number of those called are chosen, because many do not respond to the call and comply with the terms. They must manifest holiness while in the flesh and not only after reaching heaven. Hence it is seen that such holiness is not perfection of the flesh, but means that they must be whole-heartedly and absolutely devoted to God and must manifest this by an honest, diligent effort to show forth his praises. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 273, 274</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Continue ye in my love. If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love.—John 15: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Shortly following the end of the World War, and the coming of the Lord to his temple, he gave the commandment to the pruned or disciplined ones to ‘preach this kingdom gospel’. Those who had been faithful in obeying the Lord’s commandment and who had thus shown their love for God and for Christ, upon them the Lord bestowed even greater love. To these approved ones the invitation was given to ‘enter into the joy of the Lord’. God has taken Jesus and his body members into partnership with him for the kingdom. Those now on earth have some work to do, and they are made members of the “faithful and wise servant”. Their work is then to bring forth or bear the fruits of the kingdom, and this they do by diligently looking after the kingdom interests.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">My little children, let no man lead you astray: he that doeth righteousness is righteous.-l John 3:7, R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who have the love of the truth never rejoice in unrighteousness, because ‘love rejoices not in unrighteousness but in the truth’. (1 Cor. 13:6) There are today several companies of those who claim to be in the truth but none of which agree upon their doctrines or stand together in harmony. The only thing they do agree upon is their opposition to the Society and the kingdom work. They once received the truth, but, whatever truth they received or have, they do not have the love of the truth nor the works accompanying the love of the truth. They have not the love of the truth which the truth held only in righteousness always develops. Their advice and speech is not only unsound, but deceptive and misleading. Let no one be deceived by them. No one having the love of the truth will be deceived. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/1/30</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall dwell in safety.—Ps. 16: 9, R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The affection of the servant class is set upon Jehovah; therefore his heart rejoices in Jehovah. He has a keen appreciation of the honorable place he has in God’s organization; and for that reason he exults, not in himself, but in his God. No human creature could ever be exalted to a position so honorable and blessed as that of being an ambassador of the great Creator, clothed with the splendor and copiousness of the high office of bearing the name of the Most High to others. The physical organism of each one of the servant class on earth is weak, and each one realizes that he is surrounded by the enemy and his agencies, and that the enemy would instantly destroy him; but appreciating the fact that he is one of God’s anointed sons, he knows he is safe and secure. Therefore he says: “Even my flesh shall dwell in security.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/15/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And they sung a new song, saying, Thou . . . hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.—Rev. 5:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No longer is this a time of weeping, but the time has come to sing the new song to the honor and glory of Jehovah and his glorious King. The new song in effect says: ‘A new epoch has begun; the kingdom is here, and the tried and precious Stone, Christ Jesus, has been laid in Zion and made the chief Stone of the corner.’ He is a tried, precious and sure foundation, and the Head of God’s organization, and all members thereof sing his praises and the praises of Jehovah. All these (represented by the twenty-four elders) say: “Thou art worthy, . . . for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood ” Thus the Lord Jesus is identified as the Redeemer and Savior, High Priest and King, and the twenty-four elders are members of his royal line. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 68</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.—1 Cor. 8:1, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some have received the truth but have not received the love of the truth.’ (2 Thess. 2:10) They received a knowledge of the truth in a spirit of selfishness, and it is made plain by the Scriptures that such are not to be crowned with the prize. A mere mental knowledge of the truth does not prove at all that one will be in the kingdom. If one prides himself on the fact that his knowledge concerning the Bible is greater than that of his fellows, and allows this to puff him up, he looks upon himself with importance, thinks more highly of hftnself than he ought to think, and thus proves that he has not received the love of the truth. In time the “energy of delusion” comes and those who have had the wrong motive fall thereunder and believe a lie rather than the truth. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And the Spirit and the bride say, . . . Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.—Rev. 22:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To millions of people of good will throughout the land the World is like a parched desert where there is neither food nor water. God’s remnant bring them the glad message, and say to them: “Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.” They are told that they may now take their stand on the Lord’s side, and against the Devil, and receive a blessing. Is it not such a class of people that may now seek meekness and righteousness, and be hid in the day of God’s expressed wrath, and be carried beyond the great battle of Armageddon and live forever and not die? (Zeph. 2:3) The remnant must now be witnesses to and leaders of the people. They are commanded to point the people to the fact that soon the great highway to life will be opened. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 283,284</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie.—2 Thess. 2:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For what cause! Manifestly because they have not received “the love of the truth’’ and are therefore open to the enemy’s deceptions and ready to believe the lie, which is anti-kingdom. God is not responsible for the organization of error, but by casting Satan out of heaven and by taking away the administration of the holy spirit as an advocate and by letting Su-tan at them, God sends them “a working of error” or “an energy of delusion”, and the great deceiver enters into them. Thus, it being &quot;for this cause”, Jehovah is completely exonerated from being a party to the deception. He gave them the truth and they received it but not the love of it and did not show their love for him, and therefore put themselves in a position to believe the lie and to have pleasure in unrighteousness. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it.—Zech. 4: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After Zerubbabel and the released Israelites with him returned to Jerusalem it was proper for them to work on the temple building, because that was God’s expressed purpose and will concerning them. They must, however, do that work in God’s appointed way, and they did. In these last days, when God is erecting his temple “not made with hands”, his people have been informed concerning the temple and its rebuilding and their own work or service in connection with its being brought together and their opportunity to do service. Those who serve must therefore render service to God in his appointed way. He has but one appointed way. It follows that anyone who would pursue a contrary course would be opposing God.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.—Bev. 22:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With those of the remnant the issue is now eternal life or eternal death. There is no middle ground. These have been anointed to places in the holy Jerusalem. Their entrance through the gates of the holy city depends upon their keeping faithfully God’s commandments. The mere fact that one is brought into the temple and enters into the secret place of the Most High is not an absolute guarantee that he shall be there forever. To abide there he must prove his faithfulness by obeying God’s commandments. Nothing short of holiness, which means absolute and complete faithfulness in looking after the kingdom interests, will be required. Therefore, “blessed are they that do his commandments.’’ </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 276,277</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law.—Jas. 4:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The apostle adds: “But if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.” Jehovah has prescribed his rules of action for the government of his people. He has not delegated this authority to men. If a man attempts to render judgment or decision concerning another and his standing with God he therefore makes himself a judge of God’s law, which thing he is not authorized to do. He assumes to fill a place that is not his, and therefore his course would not be pleasing to the Lord. If convinced in his own mind that his brother is pursuing a wrongful course and is reprehensible before God, it is his duty to avoid such a one, but never to punish him or attempt to punish him.—Rom. 16:17,18.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">He hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords.—Rev. 19:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This name, plainly displayed and easy to be seen by all, denotes that a great duel is about to be fought and that it will for ever decide the rulership of the earth and that Jehovah has sworn that Jesus Christ shall win. The thigh was that part of the body to which the hand was put when swearing to an obligation that must be performed. Generals of worldly armies usually stay in the rear or hide their identity lest, if they fall in the attack at the enemy’s hands, their armies might be demoralized. Not so with Jesus Christ. He leads the fight and invites all the power the enemy may hurl against him. This not only signifies that Jesus is fearless and certain of victory, but inspires faith in his followers that they are not to hide themselves but are to boldly bear the banner of the Lord and advertise the King and his kingdom. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 167</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—John 6: 45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By what means has the Christian been taught, and what is his best teacher? The Christian has learned valuable lessons by his knowledge of God and his Word and by the manner of God’s dealing with him. He might actually live through many events and by them learn nothing; but by the knowledge which he gains from the Word of God and God’s approval of his course of action, he is taught. The best teacher is Jehovah God; and those who are desirous of learning he teaches by his Word and by the manifestation of his loving approval of those who serve him. The knowledge of God, and loving obedience, is that which brings real profit. It is impossible to know God’s will without studying his Word.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The supper of the great God; that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men.—Rev. 19:17, 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It will be a great slaughter; and it will be the last one, because there will be no need to duplicate it. Satan’s mighty organization, including his armies, navies, great corporations, institutions and organizations of men, and those that control and manage them, shall all fall. This great carnage at Armageddon will be God’s open judgment forcibly executed on the enemy organization in vindication of his word and name, and it will figuratively be meat and drink to those who delight themselves in Jehovah. (John 4:32,34) It will be a joy to their hearts and will give them strength to go onward in the work and service which God may yet have for them to do on earth.—Mic. 5:7, 8. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 174, 175</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This glorious city is ‘the perfection of beauty, out of which Jehovah shines’. (Ps. 50:2) The divine description of that glorious city is given, not merely for the purpose of contemplation by the remnant of the blessedness to be enjoyed after entering into everlasting glory, but particularly to enable the remnant now on earth to see that all who will enter must be completely devoted to Jehovah now. Being now made members of that blessed organization each of the remnant must now reflect the glory of the Lord and obey the commandments when he hears: “Ye are my witnesses that I am God. ’ ’ </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 249</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Rev. 21:24, Diag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In due time the earth will be filled with a knowledge of Jehovah’s glory. Then all people (now forming the nations) shall walk in the midst of the great light of the kingdom. Christ Jesus is the “King of kings”. AU who are of his royal house are made kings and priests. Even now the approved ones who are walking according to the light are in that capacity, from God’s viewpoint. The kings that bring their glory into the holy city must be limited to the 144,000. It is God’s organization, and the members of it will bring their all into that kingdom. Hence the kings of the earth, that is to say, those who will rule the earth, bring into the kingdom their glory and honor, all of which proceeds from Jehovah. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 250, 251</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Paul did not try to make a great name for himself among men. He did not yield to fleshly desires to receive the plaudits of men. He did not deceive himself into believing he must take such a pious and sanctimonious course in order to induce others to accept the truth He was taking no uncertain course, nor beating the air. One who beats the air deceives himself ana, deceives some creatures, but not the Lord in the slightest. One may think his thoughts and actions ate entirely pure and holy and at the same time they are abominable in God’s sight because he is thinking of how great, good and mighty he is and how desirable it will be to have him in heaven.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God is the King Eternal. The kingdom is his. These two great and fundamental truths have passed over the head of the majority of those who have claimed to follow Christ and to serve God. Any departure from fundamental truth necessarily leads one into dangerous paths and often results in disaster. Fundamental truths serve as guide stakes by which all other doctrines are to be measured. Everything good proceeds from Jehovah God; therefore the truth concerning him is of the greatest importance. God is the Creator of heaven and earth. His name “Jehovah” signifies his purposes toward his creatures which purposes he has expressed in his Word. The name “Almighty” signifies that nothing can successfully resist his power. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, . . . saying, Alleluia; for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.—Rev. 19:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The message proclaimed in this verse fixes the time when this anthem of praise begins; to wit, when the Lord God omnipotent places his beloved Son on his throne in Zion and his reign begins. The seventh angel began to sound, and the proclamation is made to the glory of Jehovah. It was at Detroit in 1928 that the remnant on earth discerned and took up this song of praise and began to herald it throughout the earth; therefore those joining in the Hallelujah song must include the remnant of God’s people on earth. Therefore there must continue to be a wide witness to the truth; and the remnant will give this witness. Jehovah is God; and let that now be told by all who love him. Others will join in the song of praise later. The remnant must do it now. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 150</span></p>

They know not the day nor the hour that Armageddon shall be fought, but they do know that it is only a short time ahead. They know that within a very brief time the name of Jehovah and his word shall be vindicated. With gladness they continue to shout forth the praises to his name and to the name of his glorious King. The kingdom is here and the remnant are drinking anew the fruit of the vine with the glorious Lord and King. To each other they are saying: “The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.” Together they lift up the voice and sing the new song unto the glory of Jehovah. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 288</span></p>
