<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Humanity’s Third Lung</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">N</span><span class="font7">OT only is the skin nature’s garment for protecting the delicate organs of the body from, injury and for shielding them from sudden heat or cold; it is more. It is a third lung, through which we breathe; and as such it fills </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">most important office. There is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">story of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">little girl who, to fill a part in a papal procession, was covered with gold leaf. She died in a short time, not because of exposure, but because all the pores of her body were stopped and nature was not able to carry on its usual operations through those tiny apertures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are seven millions of those little waste pipes in the human body. They carry off one and a half to two pounds of waste material daily. Most of this material is water, but in this perspiration there is a considerable amount of worn-out tissue from the interior of the body </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font7">well as from the exterior. When these pores </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font7">unobstructed, the inhaling of oxygen goes on through them to such an extent, and the blood is cleansed by this means to such an extent, that the skin is sometimes referred to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font7">nature’s third lung. (Hence the title to the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">study </span><span class="font7">of this subject, which we have been requested by one of our readers to pubfish in The Golden Age.) The pores, if open, exude great amounts of poisonous carbonic acid gas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Experiments have been made of putting the body into an air-tight vessel, with the head outside, and then reversing the process; and it is claimed that the results are nearly the same. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font7">distress is about as great in the one case as </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font7">the other. It is well known in the mining regions that a bum which covers one-third of the body of a miner (and many of the serious injuries to miners are in the nature of burns) always results in death. The body cannot go on doing its work when one-third of the pores have become closed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now it happens that we live in a world where, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">if </span><span class="font7">we are going to accomplish anything, we shall </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font7">brought more </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font7">less into contact </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">with grimy </span><span class="font7">or at least dusty articles; </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and the perspiration </span><span class="font7">from the inside of our bodies, already holding considerable waste matter, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">picks up still more. </span><span class="font7">Hence there comes </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">time when, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">with apologies </span><span class="font7">to Hamlet, we say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To bathe, or not to bathe—that is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ths </span><span class="font6">question: Whether ’tie nobler in the man to continue To accumulate fatty secretions, dead skin, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">An</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">d </span><span class="font6">dirt from inside and outside until He has scales like a poor fish, Or, by opposing, end them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To wash, or not to wash—ay, there’s the rub.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Whether to wait until Saturday night</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Or the Fourth of July,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Or leave it all for the undertaker— &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This puzzles the will, and makes </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">some rather </span><span class="font6">Bear the waste they have</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Than risk some troubles that they know not </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To keep in healthy condition </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the skin needs </span><span class="font7">air, water, and friction; and it should have the sun, too, if this can be obtained. Moreover, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">remove the dirt effectively, some </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of the water </span><span class="font7">applied to the skin must be warm, and soap must be used. But the effect of cold water </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font7">the skin and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font7">the complexion is better </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">than </span><span class="font7">that of warm water. It improves the color </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">the tone, as well as prevents wrinkles </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">chapping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The principal reason why there is more sickness in the winter than in the s</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">umm</span><span class="font7">er is that in the winter there are very many people </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font7">never get into </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">perspiration, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">hence never </span><span class="font7">get the dirt </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">out </span><span class="font7">of their pores. As </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a consequence </span><span class="font7">they throw more and more work upon the lungs, kidneys, and excretory apparatus generally, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">more than those organs can </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">bear. Disease is </span><span class="font7">the result. An inactive skin is specially </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">subject </span><span class="font7">to a c</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">hill</span><span class="font7">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This does not mean, however, that ba</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">thing !■ </span><span class="font7">a cure-all; for there is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">no cure-all in this world. But it does mean that bathing is something to</span></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark33"><span class="font7">*“</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark34"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">B48 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The qoLDEN’AQE</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font7">which every person must give attention if he would keep well. Besides, he owes it to others; for an unclean person is very offensive. In very . cold weather one of the best ways to keep warm is to take frequent baths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some skin diseases are aggravated by bathing; and if a person thus affected finds persistent redness, pimples, or watery heads making their appearance the bathi ng should be reduced in frequency and length until the symptoms disappear. To a person thus afflicted, a simple tub-bath once a week in tepid water is about the best treatment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bathing has a powerful effect upon the nervous system, for the reason that there are millions of tiny nerve-endings in the skin, and nervous people need to pay more attention to the subject than those fortunate, or unfortunate, individuals who have no such things as nerves and who mistakenly think that others have none. It is hard for a bulldog or a dachshund rightly to appreciate an Airedale or a greyhound. The effect of water upon the nerve-endings can be judged from the fact that when water is suddenly thrown in a person’s face it causes him to gasp for breath.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">ROM the Scriptures wo know that Pharaoh’s daughter was accustomed to take a daily plunge in the Nile (Exodus 2:5); that the Aaronie priesthood was washed on induction into office (Exodus 29:4); that frequent subsequent washings were required of them, and a special laver or font was provided for the purpose (Exodus 30:18-20); that the sacrifices must be washed before presentation to the Lord (Leviticus 1: 9,13); that there were elaborate provisions f-or the washing of the flesh and the clothes of the people (Leviticus Ch. 11; 13-17; 22); that Naaman was instructed to dip seven times in the Jordan (2 Kings 5); that David’s sin was partly traceable to the fact that, from the roof of the king’s house, he saw a woman bathing (2 Samuel 11:2); that Christ washed the feet of his disciples (John 13:5-14); and that the pools of Bethesda and Siloam, in the city of Jerusalem, were much used for public bathing and recommended by the Lord for that purpose. (John 9:7; 5:2-7) In the case of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">pool of </span><span class="font7">Bethesda it was fed by mineral springs impregnated with gas, discharged at intervals. Altogether, the subject of bathing and washing is mentioned in the Scriptures something </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">over </span><span class="font7">150 times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Among the Greeks the care of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">body, </span><span class="font7">reached a high state of development. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Homer </span><span class="font7">mentions that when Ulysses entered the palaos of Circe a bath was prepared for </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font7">. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Hip* </span><span class="font7">pocrates regarded water as of special value </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font7">the treatment of acute diseases. There </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">were ’ </span><span class="font7">hot sulphur-spring baths at Thermopylae, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and in </span><span class="font7">the Isles of Lesbos and Euboea, which </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">became </span><span class="font7">famous for the cure of disease. The Greeks believed that a clean body was necessary to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">possession of a sound mind; Diogenes made </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font7">home in his tub. Some of the Egyptian temples were provided with bathing places; and it </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font7">known that in the long ago bath houses </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font7">built in Assyria, Persia, and India. The Greeks were accustomed to provide warm tub-baths </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font7">their guests upon their arrival at their homes.</span></p>

C. a large public bath</span><span class="font7">house was erected outside the city of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Rome; </span><span class="font7">and from that date onward the baths multiplied rapidly until the daily consumption of water had become two hundred millions of gallons. In some of these bath-houses two thousand </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">three thousand persons could bathe at one </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">time. </span><span class="font7">Water for these bath-houses was brought from the Appenines through aqueducts constructed by various Roman emperors. The baths of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">Emperor Caracalla covered an area of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a fourth </span><span class="font7">of a mile or more on each side. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Emperor </span><span class="font7">Constantine erected large bath-houses at </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Byzan</span><span class="font7">tium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As time went on, the bath-houses </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">became </span><span class="font7">more and more elaborate. At first they </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font7">provided with separate arrangements for </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the ( </span><span class="font7">men and women. Then they were provided </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">with' </span><span class="font7">gymnasia, theatres, etc. Later, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the practice of! </span><span class="font7">men and women bathing together </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">was adopted* h </span><span class="font7">and the public baths gradually </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">became centers j </span><span class="font7">of debauchery and degeneration. With the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ad- <sub>; </sub></span><span class="font7">vent of Christianity such orgies came under </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">ban. Finally the conquering </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Goths and Huns </span><span class="font7">cut the aqueducts, and the baths were closed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Wherever the Roman legions went they car- &lt;&nbsp;ried their bathing customs; and extensive baths were built by them in the East, throughout &quot;&nbsp;northern Africa, the continent of Europe and•-&lt; in England. The best-known Boman baths in England are those at the eity of Bath, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">erected j </span><span class="font7">by the Emperor Claudius </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A. </span><span class="font7">D. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">60. </span><span class="font7">The </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">beat* </span><span class="font7">known watering places of Europe were first made famous by the baths erected during Boman occupancy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font7">RE A TENG the subject geographically, L e., starting in the East, we may say that the South Sea islanders are fond of bathing in the surf, their children taking to the water naturally. The Japanese are in the same class, and claim to be the cleanest people in the world. Tokio alone has 800 public baths, in which three hundred thousand people bathe each day at a cost of about one cent each. The baths are warm, the Japanese being particularly fond of them in this fashion and sometimes taking several in a day. In one village famed for its hot springs every person in the village bathes five times daily in the idle season, winter, and twice daily in s</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">umm</span><span class="font7">er, the children getting into the bath whenever they feel cold. Japan is a land of hot springs, so that almost every district has its natural hot baths. Public swimming baths and private baths are numerous. The sexes bathe together naked, but without violation of recognized proprieties. Instead of soap the Japanese ladies use bran bags, which make the ekin soft and smooth. The Japanese do not favor soap; for there is a superstition that it causes the hair to turn red, the traditional color of the Japanese devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of all the countries in the Far East the Chinese seem to take the least interest in the subject of bathing. Apparently there are no public bath-houses anywhere in China; and yet the Chinese in this country have an excellent reputation for cleanliness, the Chinese restaurants in New York occupying the very highest place in this respect. In India bathing in the Ganges </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font7">an act of worship. The Mohammedan religion prescribes the use of the bath, and public baths are common in Turkey and Egypt. The Turkish bath will be discussed later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Russia, Finland, Scandinavia, and Denmark hot baths and steam baths have always been popular; even the poorest Russian peasant tries to obtain a steam bath at least once a week. Where there is but little room in the house, the large household hake-oven is utilized. But in Russia there are districts where there is scarcely enough water in the villages for drinking purposes, where the residents get but three baths during their lives—at birth, before mar- . riage, and before buriaL Scarcity of water elsewhere is the cause of infrequency of bathing among other peoples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hundreds of years ago the Germans used to practise cold water bathing, the men and women bathing together, and often cutting holes in th* ice so that they might have their plunges even in midwinter. During the middle ages it was practised but little; and during the seventeenth ■' and eighteenth centuries the practice of public bathing became extinct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hydrotherapy was revived in 1829 by Vincent Priessnitz, a Silesian peasant, who established at Grafenberg a range of baths which attracted f visitors from all over Europe. The innovation was fought by the medical fraternity, but was encouraged by the Austrian government and ’ became the parent hydropathic society of,the world. At present there are great numbers of such institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But although the middle of Europe has now many bathing resorts, yet there are even now &lt;&nbsp;few bathtubs except along the beaten lines of ? American travel. In Europe one may own a ®magnificent palace, filled with luxurious furnish- 5 ings of every sort; and yet when he would $ bathe, he must ring for hot water and take his - bath standing up.</span></p>

The first bathtub in the United States was installed at Cincinnati, Ohio, on December 20, 1842, by Adam Thompson, who exhibited it and explained its workings to a Christmas party. Several of the guests later enjoyed the novelty of a plunge. The newspapers the next day denounced the installation as undemocratic and tending toward effeminacy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The next year the Legislature of Virginia laid a tax of $30 a year on each bathtub installed in that state; and in the same year the Common Council of Philadelphia failed by two votes to pass an ordinance prohibiting all bathing in that city between November first and March fifteenth. Two years later the cities of Charleston, Wilmington, Hartford, and Providence instituted charges of heavy water-rates against owners of bathtubs; and Boston, refined, fastidious, cultivated, intellectual hub of the universe,</span></p>

Today the luxuries of the bathroom run to such proportions that in Chicago one maker of fixtures has shown a $10,000 equipment for what he styles a model bathroom. This is even more ridiculous than it is to forbid bathing except on medical advice. Women are reported as taking a more general interest in the subject of bathing, the world over, than do their more savage (if they are more savage) companions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">BATH is like a meal; it is enjoyed most when there is the most need of it. Hence the time really to profit by a bath is when one has done sufficient work or taken sufficient exercise to get the pores of the body in action, pouring out their poisons upon the surface of the skin. One should never bathe for at least two hours after eating; for the blood is needed in the digestive tract, and if taken away sooner may impair the digestive apparatus. One should never bathe when greatly fatigued, as it may make too great strain upon the heart. One of the best times in the day to take a bath is when the system is at its best, say about eleven o’clock in the morning; but this is impractical for most people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The bathroom should be warm enough so that a person could remain in it naked for several minutes without taking cold; and inasmuch as respiration is quickened by the act of bathing the bathroom should be cleaned before the bath, and aired well, too. If there is a watercloset in the same apartment, as is common in American homes, it should be thoroughly cleansed before the room is aired, so that the bather will encounter no foul atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The cheaper toilet soaps have an excess of alkali, which unites harshly with the delicate fatty substances secreted for the protection of the skin, leaving the skin dry and harsh. Even the purest soap is irritating if allowed to remain on the skin; hence care should be exercised to rinse it off. Delicate skins require less soap than do others, and less in winter than in summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many famous beauties follow the Japanese customs and avoid soap altogether, using instead almond meal, oatmeal, bran and other bland, non-irritating substances, which have a soothing and softening effect upon the skin. In New York some of the beauties look as if they never washed at all in anything, but applied </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a ■ </span><span class="font7">new coat of kalsomine or varnish when the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">old-</span><span class="font7">coat begins to peel off or to show signs of cracking. They also indicate a greater fondness </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font7">the flour barrel before marriage than it is to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font7">feared some of them do afterwards. At </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">least, </span><span class="font7">their faces look that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Scrubbing brushes, bath-mits and sponges are unsanitary for bathing purposes, as they, become filled with decomposing animal matter : and cannot be easily cleansed. It is better to use a coarse wash-cloth which can he washed and boiled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The last and most important item before </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">bath is the thermometer. There is a great </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">did- </span><span class="font7">J fcrence in people; and baths which are suited to strong, powerful constitutions are extremely injurious to others. For one class of people there is need of exercise, cold treatment, cold baths, sea baths, and sea air; for their opposites there are indulgence, warmth, warm climatty warm baths, and mountain air. In a general way, strong, muscular people are in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">one ; </span><span class="font7">class, and thin, ansemic people are in the other; and the rest of us are between.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Each person, knowing his own temperament^ ; should experiment until he finds the kind ol bath temperature that agrees best with </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">him, </span><span class="font7">and then stick to that temperature. The chief value of the bath lies in the exhilaration that follows, but it should be an exhilaration that is not too hard on the heart action. Four standard temperatures for baths are recognized: Cool 70°, tepid 90°, warm 98°, hot 105°. At any ratty a thermometer should always be used in deter- <sub>; </sub>mining the temperature of a bath for invalids-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If the water for the bath is what is called &quot;hard water,” a wineglass full of common vinegar added to the tubful will neutralize or soften &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">it. Hard water carries an excess of lime </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">other minerals, and is not so good a dirt solvent <sub>x </sub>as soft water.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">University, and the dean of physical director* in America, has the opinion that few persons . have such a constitution that they can stand </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a -</span><span class="font7">plunge into cold water without injury to their 4 systems; and we think that the Doctor is right, । ■ He calle attention to the fact that many people seem proud of their morning cold plunge, and admits that the first reaction is often one of great stimulation, but found what most of us who have tried it have found—that the stimulation in the early part of the day is offset by excessive depression in the latter part. The fceart will do about so much work during the day; and if it is violently stimulated in the morning, it will take toll in the afternoon by going slower. Getting into a tub of cold water causes a rush of blood to the heart, the extent of which may be realized when it is known that, for persons who have fainted, a dash of cold water on the chest is more effective in restoring consciousness than any other remedy known. Thin persons, old persons, persons with defective circulation, and persons with heart trouble should never take a cold bath; nor should anybody take such a bath when the body is cold. Some exercise should be taken first. Cold baths are helpful to fat people who can stand the strain on their hearts, as such baths absorb the bodily heat, thus allowing less to go to the making of adipose tissue. Huxley said of those who are proud of their morning plunge in cold water that they are “conceited all the forenoon and stupid all the afternoon.” But there is apparently here and there a person that suffers no ill effects from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the general class with the cool bath must be classed sea bathing, although the Bea sometimes reaches nearly to the tepid point, in certain favored localities. Those who are not safe in a tub of cold water at home are no safer in water of the same temperature in the ocean, no matter how many others may be. It is doubtless true that many of the deaths from &quot;cramps,” so-called, are really due to sudden stoppage of the action of a weak heart. Besides the effect of the cold, already explained, the exercise of swimming is in itself one of the most strenuous kinds of exercise known. This puts additional strain on the heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sea bathing has great advantages. The effect of the sea air is stimulating, as is also the slap from the waves; and there is an advantage in the Balt, as is found in the fact that sea bathers do not take cold so quickly as bathers in rivers and fresh-water lakes. Going about on the seashore in a semi-nude condition is an excellent thing for the general health. Swimming or vig</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">orous exercise should always accompany </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a bath ; </span><span class="font7">in salt water. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first effect of a plunge into the ocean is a feeling of chilliness, followed by a feeling of warmth, if the water is not too cold, and ill the strength of the bather is equal to sea bathing. Then comes, later, a second chill; and this is the signal for leaving the water. It is dangerous to wait until the teeth begin to chatter. The colder the water the less time should be spent . in it. Young children should never be forced into it. It is better to let the salt water dry on the skin than to use a fresh-water shower afterward. After a sea bath a thorough rubbing should be given with a rough towel.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>The </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cool Sponge Bath</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">FT1HE </span><span class="font7">sponge bath is not so severe as the plunge, because the whole surface of the body is not exposed to the chilliness of the water at one time; and some can enjoy sponge baths, and be benefited by them, who would not dare to take a cold plunge. The general effect of a sponge bath is chilling, even though the water be warm; but the chilliness is quickly replaced by warmth as soon as the wet surface has been dried.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are various ways of taking sponge baths. Inasmuch as some find a tendency in the body to lean in whichever direction it is bent, they practise one morning taking a sponge over ? the entire body, the second morning over one- ■ half of the body, the third morning over the other half. Others sponge the entire body daily; others every other day; still others every day for a week, and then omit it the next week. One of the best of all ways is to sponge a small portion of the body at a time, and then dry it thoroughly before proceeding to the next. This prevents too great strain on the heart and has been found an excellent way to get the advan- &lt;&nbsp;tages of a cold bath without its disadvantages. : Some have found it an advantage in taking such i a bath to rub the surface about to be bathed with a rough towel before sponging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Once a week a warm bath, with soap, should . be taken by those who take sponge baths, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">so as </span><span class="font7">'i to remove the dirt which sponging in cold * water, without soap, will not remove. For those not strong enough to stand a sponge bath in $ cold water the water may be tempered as </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">de- </span><span class="font7">~j| sired, or even omitted, the dry rub accomplish- .’1 ing for the system a good portion of what the bath itself would accomplish. Sea salt in the water used for a sponge bath is beneficial, and may be had at drug stores. A final rub with the hands is excellent after any bath. Soap, except on hands and face, need not be used with the daily sponge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Other varieties of cool baths not so generally available are the shower bath, the rain bath, which is an overhead shower so inclined as to prevent the water from striking the head; and the needle bath, which consists of a combination of head showers, side sprays and upward jets, applied in minute streams to the whole body by a series of vertical and horizontal tubes. Then there is the douche, by which water is directed at will to any particular part of the body through a half-inch or inch hose. Most people who use baths of this kind start with warm water and finish with colder water, sometimes alternating the hot and cold streams, thus producing a most powerfully stimulating action.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>The Natural Bath</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">THE Natural Bath, so-called, takes its name from the fact that it imitates or attempts to imitate the habits of the brute creation. These never plunge at once into the water unless excited to such action by human beings, but usually back in, wetting the back parts first. Animals pursued by hunters frequently pause in the midst of flight to rub their hind quarters in a puddle or splash water upon the centers of their nervous organisms, heated by the chase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Natural Bath, discovered by Adolph Just, is claimed by its devotees to suit almost every type of person. It is taken in the bathtub, into which three or four inches of cool, but not ice-cold, water have first been placed. The bather first sits in the water, </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">imm</span><span class="font7">ersing only the seat and the feet. Immediately he begins splashing the abdomen, paying special attention to the lower part of the body, and thereafter one part of the body after another until all have been laved, the arms and legs last.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The whole bath is limited to from three to five minutes. The bather stands in the tub while letting the water out, and rubs and massages his body with his bare hands. The rubbing and slapping is kept up until the body is dry. Soap and towels are considered violations of the established rule for these baths, but are used by those persons </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">who especially prefer towels.</span></p>

Several hours in such </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a bath will ' </span><span class="font7">induce restful sleep, but the stomach should </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">be 4 </span><span class="font7">practically empty before indulging in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">bath </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of -'= </span><span class="font7">that length. If taken in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">day time or before </span><span class="font7">going out into the open air a warm bath should always be followed by changing the water in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">tub, letting out some of the warm water </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">letting in some of the cold until the water </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">has _ </span><span class="font7">become cool, but not ice-cold.

The hot bath should be used only before going to bed. The artificial heat is valuable in some cases of rheumatism, especially if sea salt be added. If one does not remain in a hot bath longer than two minutes, he gets almost as much reaction as from a cold bath. A hot foot-bath will often relieve headache, toothache, or acute pains in any part of the body; but a full hot bath will aggravate a headache, as it stimulates the general circulation, including that of the head.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>Turkish and Russian Baths</span></h3>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-variant:small-caps;text-decoration:underline;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;text-decoration:underline;">hh;</span><span class="font7"> modern Turkish bath is not modern at all and is not Turkish. It is merely one of the famous Greek baths of long ago, adopted by the Romans and subsequently discontinued by the Romans themselves, but perpetuated by the Mohammedans, and hence called Turkish. Most of our readers know the principle of these baths—a succession of rooms, heated to increasing temperatures with dry air, the hottest room perhaps running as high as 220° Fahrenheit. The bather goes from one room to the other, under the direction of an attendant. He is encouraged to drink quantities of cold water, with the result that shortly he is in a copious perspiration. A shampoo, a shower bath, a plunge, if desired, a thorough drying and a period of rest, with variations of the program, complete the bath. These baths are permissible only to those with strong lungs and strong hearts; and even then should be taken at rare intervals, as they are exhausting. It is much better for a person to produce a perspiration by exercise than by such means. Very fat persons should keep out of Turkish baths; and no one should take them with the idea that they are beautifying, for such is not the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Russian bath, so-called, did not originate with the Russians. It is a modern name for the old “hadstu” of the Vikings. The “badstugas” of long ago were single-room huts, heated by a bath stove constructed of masonry. Large round stones were placed upon bars over the fire; and after the fire had gone out hot water was poured upon these superheated stones, until the room was filled with vapor. Benches for the bathers were arranged in terraces, those 'desiring the higher temperatures and freer perspiration selecting the higher ones. The “badstu,” with modifications, has been used by the Scandinavians, Slavs, Teutons, Eskimo^ ? and North American Indians.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">TD</span><span class="font7">IIYSICIANS are now generally agreed that there is little or nothing of merit in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">what </span><span class="font7">IS were once a great fad; namely, medicated baths. There seems to be a complete lack of evidence . that the salt in sea water is absorbed through s the skin; and w’hat is true of the salt in sea -water is true of all other salts and chemicals, ■ or supposedly so. It is now claimed that the 1 principal curative effect of mineral baths, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">mud </span><span class="font7">baths, pine-leaf baths, olive-pulp baths, dung baths, grape-skin baths, alkaline baths, acid ■' baths, iodine baths, bromine baths, mercurial baths, sulphur baths, and seaweed baths is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">stimulating effect upon the skin. Mud baths h; take little heat from the body and exert </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a | </span><span class="font7">soothing influence on the nervous system. It is &nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">noteworthy that at some places where it is &nbsp;&nbsp;?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">claimed that miracles are wrought by the effect ?• of certain waters, the waters themselves </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font7">remarkable for their freedom from all mineral \-ingredients. Some have ascribed the. virtues of ‘y mud baths to f ormie acid, a volatile body formed ■ by ants, having a very pungent odor and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">con- ? </span><span class="font7">siderable stimulating power. Others, and more recently, have claimed that the benefit derived from baths of this nature is wholly due to the 1 fact that the materials are slightly radioactive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Blood, milk, whey, broth, wine, strawberry p juice, elder flower juice, chickweed and other '■ delectable combinations and concoctions have </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font7">h various times been used by the ladies with </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">S view to heightening their charms; but their ? value for the purpose is to be doubted. The h Empress Poppaea took daily milk baths, the milk being obtained from 500 asses kept for the j purpose. We have nothing against Poppsea, not I a thing; but it seems to us that she was what might be called '''light in her upper story.” </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font7">case is a little different with the actress, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Anna • </span><span class="font7">Held. Her press-agent had a wagon load </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of -</span><span class="font7">milk delivered at her hotel every day, and the newspapers had a lot to say about Anna Held’s </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">milk</span><span class="font7"> baths, but it leaked out afterwards that Anna never got into the milk. She got into the papers instead, and that was what the milk was for. The milk itself was poured out, wasted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sand baths have always been and will continue to be popular. The patient is buried in hot sand, and exposed to the full rays of the sun or to artificial heat. In Dresden and other </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">European </span><span class="font7">cities there are establishments for the methodical application of this form of treatment. The combined effect of the heat and of surface irritation is to produce copious perspiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A bath in the air, and if possible in the sun, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font7">beneficial to every one. If the nude surface of every human being could be exposed daily to the rays of the sun for thirty minutes, the result would be in a few years to increase the vigor and power of the race greatly. When nudity is not possible, very light clothing may be worn and great benefits still be gained. The head should be protected from the direct action ofi the sun’s rays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the mechanical wave bath, common in some parts of Europe, the water is kept constantly in motion, resulting in an increasing stimulation to the bather. There are baths in which galvanic currents and electro-magnetic currents are passed through the water, besides foot, sitz and hip baths, used principally for remedial purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The best time to wash the head is at bedtime, as it induces sleep. The head bath should begin with warm water and soap and finish off with cold water and friction. After a head bath the &lt;&nbsp;hair should he thoroughly dried before retiring. It is a good idea after a bath of any kind to slap the flesh gently after the body is dry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font7">N VIEW of the fact that the Scriptures teach an age in which righteousness will prevail, under the leadership of the Prince of Peace, an age in which there is to be a “restitution of all things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began,” it becomes a matter of wonderment as to what shall be the spoken language of that epoch, seeing that the human fa</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">m</span><span class="font7">ily shall become one family, with mental, moral, and physical perfection restored to them. We sometimes wonder whether there shall be a continuance of the hundreds of dialects and languages, or whether in the restoring process the race shall gradually grow into the use of one language, and, if so, what it will be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Perhaps in each nationality there are those </span><span class="font7">who at least wish it might be their own tongue. Shall it be English or French or German or Chinese or Greek or Hebrew? There is an effort being made to establish a universal language in Esperanto, and schools of instruction are springing up in many countries; and the claim is made that if the pupil knows </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">little about grammar and applies himself he may speak Esperanto fluently in three months’ time. It is interesting to view this subject from the Scriptural point of view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Therefore I will submit the following facts, proven by the Scriptures and substantiated by present events, showing which language </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font7">the favor of Jehovah at the present time and also that it will he the language of the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 3:21 tells us of the times of restitution</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">all things, &quot;which God hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets since the world began; and I fail to find any mention of Esperanto in the Scriptures anywhere; but the prophet Moses speaks of a language spoken in the garden of Eden by the first man Adam when he named all the animals as they were brought before him. Unquestionably that language will be restored shortly and become universal, the language which the great Creator gave to man st the beginning; for not one jot or tittle of the law or prophets shall pass away, till all be fulfilled.—Matthew 5:17,18.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">ERMIT me to submit the following as proof that the original Hebrew is the language</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">which was used in the beginning, and that it is now in process of restoration, and that it has the blessing of the great Creator upon it at this time, and that it will be the language of the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All the world was of one language until a long time after the Flood; and that language of course was the language spoken by the first man, Adam, received by him from his Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let us show how this language became the language of Israel. Adam died at the age of 930 years. Lamech, Noah’s father, born A. M. 874, and 56 years old when Adam died, without doubt heard the wonderful story of Paradise, of the fall and the curse, from Adam, in the original language; for there was none other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Lamech died at the age of 777 years, in the year A. M. 1651.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Shem, his grandson, was born A. M. 1558. He was therefore 93 years old when Lamech died and had heard the story of Paradise from Iris grandfather, to whom it had been told by Adam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now Shem lived 600 years and died A. M. 2158. This Shem spoke the language of Adam and was the progenitor of Abraham and all Jewry. See Genesis 11:11-32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Abraham lived from 1948 to 2123, and Shem lived 35 years after Abraham’s death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Isaac was born A. M. 2048.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jacob was born A. M. 2108; and as Shem died A. M. 2158, we see that Jacob lived for fifty years contemporaneously with Shem, whose grandfather had spoken with Adam and had told Shem all about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This is conclusive proof that these ancient worthies, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, spoke the V-original language of Paradise, and that that language is the original Hebrew language. S (Abraham, the Hebrew; Semitic, Shemitic.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Exodus 6 shows us that Amram married <sup>:</sup>-Levi’s daughter Jochebed, and that these </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font7">the parents of Moses. Thus we see how the wonderful story of Paradise was brought down by word of mouth in the original language from Adam to Lamech, Lamech to Shem, Shem </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">Jacob, Jacob to Jochebed, the mother of Moses, who was able to give the whole story of creation to her son Moses in the original language, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">which </span><span class="font7">enabled Moses to write it down in what is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">original Hebrew of the Old Testament. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">That / </span><span class="font7">the Hebrew language has been out of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">favor : </span><span class="font7">even as the Israelites have been </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">out of favor </span><span class="font7">w<sup>r</sup>ith Jehovah as a punishment for disloyalty, there is no doubt. But now we see the restoration of Palestine and the anxiety of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Jew <sup>r </sup></span><span class="font7">for the restoration of his language, the ancient Hebrew; and as we see the favor of God </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">coining = </span><span class="font7">to the Jew again and note the great revival </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ofi </span><span class="font7">v the language of Adam we must confess </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font7">that language which was spoken by the mouth of all God’s holy prophets will be the universal language in the ages to come.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Argument for Esperanto </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By James Denson Sayen</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">W</span><span class="font7">HEN one deals with well-established facts concerning any subject of more or less public interest, it is quite easy to find a solid premise and build the discussion thereon. Bub </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">if </span><span class="font7">the pro or the con in any debatable question is based upon a mere theory, unsupported by any direct or even indirect information, the argument becomes somewhat uncertain. And in such a position we find ourselves in attempting to discuss the suggestion that the Hebrew language is to be restored and become the universal language of the restitutional age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Within recent years one of the fulfilments of Biblical prophecy has been the great increase in knowledge. God long ago declared by the mouths of His prophets that in the last days, on the eve of the establishment of His Idngdom on earth, knowledge would be very greatly increased. We know that the immense strides made by the human race in all manner of learning and inventions during the last half century have been possible only because God so willed it. Proud and haughty infidels arrogate unto their own petty selves the honor of all great accomplishments, even threatening to make a better job of creation than God has made. But we know that there is a divine plan, and that the plan is unfolding according to its great Architect’s designs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God has inspired great archeologists to delve into the ruins of ancient cities of the Near East, where He has preserved under the dry desert dust rich remains and testimonials to corroborate much of His Word and to give very valuable historical information to the faithful diggers after knowledge. By such painstaking labors, within the past seventy-five years, we have come into very much knowledge that bears Upon ancient Biblical records, never at great variance with the latter as we have long known. We have learned quite definitely enough that the Hebrew language, in which the Old Testament was recorded from the Pentateuch down to the last records made before the Babylonian captivity, was </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">far richer language of derivation than the simple monosyllabic language spoken by the first emigrants from Ur of the Chaldees who reached Palestinian valleys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This fact is clear from a few definite remains </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">samples of that simple herdsman language </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">Abraham and his contemporaries. The He</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">brew </span><span class="font7">language of the first portion of the Bible, the language of Moses, David and Solomon, Was a language already grown rich by literary expression practised contemporaneously with a great development of language among the surrounding Egyptian, Babylonian, Syrian, and other peoples. The linguistic art of first building new forms of thought by joining two monosyllables and then developing prefixes and suffixes for further extending the nuances of word meanings was most certainly a development which came long after Abraham drove his docks into the Jordan valley. No doubt similar forms of many of the original words prevailed and form the roots of a very large portion of the richer literary language, but when one speaks of the beauty, picturesqueness and power of description and expression of ancient Hebrew, one cannot be referring to the simple language of Abram of Ur, but only to a well-developed language enriched by contact with the culture of civilizations six hundred to a thousand years after Abraham’s time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is only theory, unsupported by any statement in the Scriptures, to say that even a close approximation of the language spoken by father Adam was the language spoken by Abraham, much less by Moses and King David. Granting that Shem spoke the exact language of Adam, his descendants lived nomadic herdsman lives, very probably being more or less in contact with other tribes, descendants of other sons of Noah, speaking many different developments of the languages which God, for His own high purposes, caused to develop soon after the Flood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that Adam spoke and handed down unspoiled to his Hebrew descendants the language in which the first part of the Old Testament is recorded. Can we find in that language names for a polar bear, a seal, an American buffalo, an automobile, a telegraph or telephone, for radium, for that most wonderful single force that God has unfolded to His creatures in these latter times, electricity? If father Adam should awaken tomorrow from his long sleep in death and see an aeroplane dashing thunderously over his head, he would very likely give it a new name. One may say that Adam was given a perfect language, that it was lost by the fall into sin, and that it will be revived. This would be getting almost over to the belief that God will miraculously give to humanity a perfect universal language. Any one has a right to such belief.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ml</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Ancient Biblical Hebrew was a very rich improvement over the monosyllabic language of the Chaldean herdsmen of early postdiluvian times. It had learned the great value of affixes for increasing the richness of its form variations without straining the memory with extra arbitrary words. Dr. Zamenhof, a devout Jew and expert Hebrew scholar, developed by far the most perfect language yet recorded among men. In so far as he found advantages in the language of his forefathers which were useful in the construction of a language easy of acquirement and flexible in usage for all the diverse elements of humanity, he adopted them. In so far as he found ancient Hebrew just a polyglot growth, illogical and extremely difficult of mastery, he left it out of Esperanto. By his years of scholarly and painstaking search, he grafted into Esperanto the cream of the beauty and logic of all the present-day highly developed languages, which in turn have drawn on the more or less rich storehouses of the ancient languages, including ancient Hebrew. As a result, the devout, God-fearing Jew, Zamenhof, great idealist and lover of his fellow men of all races and creeds, developed a language so simple of mastery by all nationalities, even for the Orientals, so flexible and fitting for every manner of usage, that one who studies the question broadly and has an open heart toward God must recognize the believable probability that it is part of God’s work brought along in due season.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Having studied ancient Hebrew somewhat, I am sure it would take me five thousand hours of severe study to gain indifferent mastery of it. In one hundred hours of study I was able to speak Esperanto almost as easily as I speak mother English. Some members of my Espe- , ranto class in New York speak and understand | Esperanto surprisingly well after five lessons. I shudder to think of how far we would </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">be, </span><span class="font7">after an equal amount of study, from an under- ’ standing of the complicated ancient Hebrew vowel signs, much less the proper verbal infleo-tions and sentence construction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The sudden flaring up of interest in Espe- $ ranto in nearly every part of the earth during | the past two years, and more especially during | this past winter, is significant. Some few </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font7">felt that the Lord wished to use them through this new medium. They have already begun to do good work in sending the message to hungering persons in far lands where but </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">few &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font7">5</span></p>

In every such case they were advised that if they felt they were already in their present field of endeavor doing as effective ? work for the Master as they could in the new, e by all means not to give the Lord’s time up to -the time required to learn this language.

<p><span class="font7">In the circumstances of the draft it is pointed out that over fifty percent put in formal claims </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">exemption and that over eight percent failed </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">appear, succeeding in escaping arrest, to say nothing of the many who registered unwillingly, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">number of evaders left unknown, and the many desertions (over 1,400 in ten months), from the army.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The illegality of the conscription is shown in its violation of </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font7">endment Thirteen of our Constitution, which provides that “neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as punis</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">hm</span><span class="font7">ent for crime wherein the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States or any state subject to their jurisdiction.&quot; An excuse for the draft was used in the example of its being enforced during the Civil War; but the Thirteenth Amendment was adopted after the close of that war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the first half of his book Mr. Turner exposes in detail the campaign of secret intrigue with its carefully devised propaganda that was foisted on the people to bring about belligerency—how the press, pulpit, and college each competed diligently to spread this propaganda, and how our Constitution was again violated by the President’s usurpation of the powers that this document grants only to the legislative bodies of our government (“The Congress shall have power to declare war”), in his ordering the arming of merchant ships and providing them with navy gunners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another violation is shown in the Espionage Act, in its conflict with the First Amendment, “Congress shall make no law respecting </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font7">establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech or the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble,” etc. Are we </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font7">today experiencing the results of these violations of our Constitution in the great difficulty, if not inability, of enforcing the Prohibition Amendment! For how can an individual be expected to adhere to a law that he deems an obstruction to his liberties after witnessing violation and complete overthrowal of lawn incorporated for the protection of his liberties, by the chief executive of his government!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The second portion of the book deals with our objectives, and shows in what manner the financial interests cooperated to bring about belligerency. Here is an overwhelming exposure of “big business” in its many depredations to influence and coerce the people. The starting point was the loan of $500,000,000 to England by the J. P. Morgan Company, agents for </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">number ofl American bankers and financiers, without security other than the willingness and honesty of the British government. A “peace without victory” on the part of England would have placed this loan in jeopardy, as political upheavals and possible revolutions would have made repayment difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then follows the story of the campaign of corruption and graft indulged in by the war “patrioteers,&quot; including the American Federation of Labor, under Samuel Gompers, who </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">sat </span><span class="font7">with the financiers and obeyed their dictates, expecting to share the plunder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To illustrate the extent that our government was under the control of the corporations, Mr. Turner cites the long list of corporation heads who were given positions of active control ol various governmental departments during ths period of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The long list of treaty violations indulged </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in by </span><span class="font7">the various belligerent countries, including the United States, is given complete publicity. Some of those mentioned are: The Clayton-Bulwer Treaty, between America and England, guaranteeing the integrity of Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and the Mosquito Coast—violated by both America and England; the Berlin Act of 1885, between England, France, Germany, Belgium, and other countries, guaranteeing the integrity of the Congo Free State—violated by Belgium’s annexation of the Congo, without consent and without protest from other powers; the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">treaty </span><span class="font7">between England, France, Russia, and Japan, guaranteeing the integrity of Korea—violated by Japan’s invasion of Korea, against the protests of the sovereign of that country; the Act of Algeciras, 1906, between England, France, Germany, and other countries — violated by France sending in an army with the support of England and no protest to the agreement from the other parties except Germany; the Entente of 1907 between England and Russia, guaranteeing the integrity of Persia—and broken by Russia’s sending an army into Persia, which was still there when England declared war on Germany for violating Belgian neutrality. These are only a few of the treaty violations disclosed by Mr. Turner. Is there any wonder that God is angry with the nations!</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Another interesting item concerns the Bol-sheviki who, upon coming into possession of the government buildings in Petrograd, opened the Czar’s archives and found therein the secret documents of agreements that were entered into between England, France, Belgium, and Russia to bring about and conduct the war against the Central Empires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A splendid indictment is lodged against our foreign policy, which the author terms American Imperialism. Here is exposed the foreign intrigue practised by the United States against Denmark (in acquiring the Virgin Islands), Mexico, Haiti, Nicaragua, Santo Domingo, Panama, Colombia, Costa Rica, Salvador, and Honduras. Using the Monroe Doctrine as a blind, Haiti, Santo Domingo, and Nicaragua were invaded by American troops at different periods and their governments brought under American influence, so that certain financiers could get control of the wealth and public utilities of these countries and exploit their natural resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In finishing his chapter, “The Enemy at Home,” Mr. Turner says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The real enemy of America is not autocracy abroad. It is not kings or kaisers or czars. The Teal enemy of America is our rich fellow citizen who is willing to plunge our country into war for his own selfish purposes ■—his political servant, without whose voluntary cooperation public war for private profit would be impossible— his intellectual henchmen of the press, the pulpit, and</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">In a concluding chapter, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“The </span><span class="font7">Proof of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the ' </span><span class="font7">Pudding,” the author says:</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">In conclusion Mr. Turner states: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Democracy is not a reality in America.

<p><span class="font6">“The events of the past half-dozen years have demon- _ strated not only the moral bankruptcy of the political and intellectual leaders that capitalism has given </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">world, but the inability of capitalism to save the world from periodic (or total I) disaster. Imperialism is aim- 1 ply a phase of capitalism. Big business government ’* must go; but big business government will not </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">go until </span><span class="font6">big business goes. Only the institution of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">new </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">social ' </span><span class="font6">order, based on economic equality, will save the world ?' from more and more wars for business.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- J</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The foregoing outline is only </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">very </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">meager ■ </span><span class="font7">description of the wonderful collection of his- -torical facts, and makes no pretense of doing justice to such a work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Constitution of the United </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">States is one of </span><span class="font7">the finest and most democratic sets of written laws for the conduct of a nation. It has been used as a model in the drafting of many similar documents for other countries. It is quite possible that its authors drafted it, unknowingly, under divine inspiration. The ancient Jewish nation had, as a basis of their government, a set of divinely instituted laws, and were instructed by the Author thereof that </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font7">long </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font7">they adhered strictly to their statutes they would thrive and become the leading nation of the earth. But they kept not their statutes, and as a result suffered complete disorganization, and have remained under the dictatorship of the Gentiles unto this 'day. Should we not heed this as an example of what Is very likely to befall us in the approaching great trouble wherein the nations shall be dashed in pieces like a potter’s vessel?</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">There is every reason to believe that the institution of the new social order spoken of by Mr. Turner is taking place under the leadership and inspiration of Him whose right it is; for “He shall judge among many people and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make, them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts has spoken it.”—Micah </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">4</span><span class="font7">: 3, 4.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>From Ceylon</span></h3>
<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font7">S </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">AL</span><span class="font7">L your readers are interested in the signs of the times, a terse and crisp account of a very unusual occurrence in Ceylon which marks the fulfilment of Biblical prophecy will, I feel sure, appeal to all of them. Jesus Christ declared that at His second coming (presence) and at the time when the Old World should end there would be “upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity; the sea and the waves [the restless, discontented masses] roaring; men’s hearts failing them for fear and for looking to the things coming upon the earth [society] ; for the powers of the heavens [eccle-siasticism] shall be shaken. . . . When ye see these things come to pass, then know that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand. Look up, lift up your heads, rejoice, for your redemption ‘draweth nigh.” The truth, the full force and accuracy, of the aforesaid declaration was brought home to Bible students in Ceylon by the workmen’s strike which broke out in Colombo a few days ago, and which still continues up to date. All people here readily admit that Colombo is just now in the throes of a strike unprecedented in the annals of Ceylon history. The workmen are demanding higher wages and greater liberties and privileges than they have hitherto enjoyed. The strike has followed close upon the Ceylon government’s passing and bringing into operation a salaries scheme which conferred handsome increases of salary upon the higher officials of government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The strike, which started among the work- &nbsp;&nbsp;)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">men of The Ceylon Government Railway, has &nbsp;&nbsp;1</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">extended to the Government Factory, Harbor j Engineers’ Department, and all the big engineering and mercantile firms. The workmen £ organized more than one mass procession of J workers, which marched through some of the -J streets in Colombo, bearing placards with the following wordings: (1) “Salaries are paid to £ the great, nothing to the small”; (2) “We are | starving workmen”; (3) “Big people want re- % forms, but we are deformed.” At the head- 1 quarters of the Ceylon Labor Union in Colombo = the following placard has been prominently £ posted up:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“United we stand, dividetl we fall; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ji</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Strike one, strike all.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All w<sup>T</sup>ork and business in Colombo harbor has | been paralyzed and b rought to a standstill; and ) people are in great distress and perplexity as to what will be the outcome of this great mass | movement of workmen. Consecrated Christians* however, are not in darkness as to the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">true </span><span class="font7">1 significance of these great upheavals which are s heralds of the Golden Age and an unmistakable 3 indication of the imminent establishment </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">Messiah’s kingdom which shall be the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;desire </span><span class="font7">of all nations.” Thank God, the Lord’s </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">kingdom </span><span class="font7">is close at hand.

<h2><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark69"></a>One of the New Fruits—The Loganberry</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">O</span><span class="font7">UT on the Pacific Coast, when they see us referring to the loganberry as a new fruit, they will uncharitably class us with Rip Van Winkle and intimate that the period of our sleep <sup>!</sup> has been forty years instead of twenty, as was the case with friend Rip. Beyond the Rockies ' anything ten years old is old; if twenty years old, it ia antique; if thirty, it is ancient; and if forty, it ia primeval. This does not apply to the ladies, however, us it is now admitted by experts that a woman is most beautiful at the age of forty; and it is well known that they never get beyond that age. (If this remark does not get us a few new subscribers, it will 6how how unappreciative the world really is.) By accident, in the summer of 1884, Judge J. H. Logan, of Santa Cruz, California, obtained in his garden a cross between the red 'Antwerp raspberry and the native wild blackberry, the loganberry, which he named for himself. In color and appearance this fruit is like the raspberry, but is larger, has a blended blackberry and raspberry flavor, and more piquancy and richness of color than either of the parent fruits. The fruit is sometimes an inch and a quarter long, blackberry shape. The flavor is unique, peculiar, and enjoyable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The loganberry, like the Californians themselves, is not hardy enough to withstand the kind of winter we have in the East. We can hardly withstand it ourselves; but the spring feels so good when it does come that it is worth . all the blizzards we get while waiting for it. These people who live in a land of perpetual spring cannot appreciate what it really means to have weather. They have climate in the West. This is very well; but when it comes to weather, if anybody wants real weather the place for him is in the East.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The loganberry thrives in California, in portions of Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia west of the Cascade Mountains, and in some of the warmer valleys of Idaho; but it does not do well in other sections of the United States. The plant is very sensitive to extremes J of heat and cold. By 1895 the growing of the fruit had spread outside of California and had begun to attract attention in the Northwest.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>Refreshing Loganberry Juice</span></h3>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font7">HAT is the way the signs read, and they tell the truth. Loganberry juice is refreshing, and at present the juice is the chief com« mercial value of the berry. To be lure, the berry is a most excellent table berry, but it ia so very juicy that it cannot be had in its natural state except on the Pacific Coast. In 2,000 pounds of fruit there are 1,560 pounds of juice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The peculiar value of the loganberry juice is its large content of citric acid, the same arid ■ that is found in limes and lemons. This makes <sub>: </sub>it unsurpassed for jellies, punches, fruit cups, and for use aboard ships. During the war it was to be found in every cantonment and aboard every battleship. Thirteen and three-tenths pounds of sugar added to a gallon of the juice &quot;&nbsp;doubles its volume and helps to overcome possibility of loss by fermentation; but with the sugar “patrioteers” again in the saddle and twenty-cent sugar again a possibility, there is not much comfort in this information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The boom in loganberry juice took place during the war. In 1915 the total sales of the juice for all companies were about $60,000; in 1916 the sales were about $200,000; in 1917 the total sales were something in excess of $1,000,000, ; and ten carloads of the juice were shipped out of Oregon in one shipment. Considerable sums have been expended popularizing the juice as &amp;&nbsp;summer drink, and with fair success. But the price of a new summer drink must be kept low <sup>v </sup>if it is to become popular, and no</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">thin</span><span class="font7">g is low any more. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The 438 pounds of pulp per ton have been \ disposed of in various ways, some of it spread on the fields, some dumped into the streams, \ some allowed to pile up and mold, and some of it made up into jam and jelly, for soldiers. Hogs and other farm animals eat the pulp ? sparingly or not at all, owing to the aridity. . As a fertilizer it has some value, adding humus, • organic matter, besides mineral constituents. Dried ground loganberry pulp has </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">calorific value of 1,458 calories a pound, nearly as </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">hig</span><span class="font7">h v as flour. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Hence it was that in 1912, after all the Pacific Coast people had had all of this delicious fruit that they wanted, and there was some left over, some kind-hearted men who remembered that most of the people in the United States live in the East, and that they might like the taste of the loganberry, and that they might be willing to pay for their taste, began to experiment with canning and evaporating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The canning was at first not successful, as the fruit is too full of citric acid to keep in plain tins; however, success was obtained when enamel-lined cans were used. Now the fruit is put up in a variety of ways. There is the water pack, used for pies, containing no sugar, and requiring to be heavily sweetened when used for pastries; and there are other ca</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">nnin</span><span class="font7">g compounds all the way up to the heavy syrup preferred by some consumers. Several growers are reported as doing well, putting up loganberries with their own home canning outfits. A center for the loganberry canning industry is Salem, Oregon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the same time that canning was begun, evaporating was also undertaken and has proven successful, many Eastern users preferring to get their fruit in this form. The same dryer used for prunes works very satisfactorily when used in drying loganberries, and it has been found that the dried fruit keeps well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Loganberry oil, presumably extracted from the pulp by some refining process, is reported to have valuable drying properties, lying in iodine value and specific gravity between hempseed oil and tung oil, the latter being obtained from the resin of an Asiatic tree and much prized as a varnish oil.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font7">HE loganberry grows best in deep, well-drained, easily-worked loam. It is propagated by allowing roots to start on the ends or tips of the canes, or by covering a portion of the cane and allowing roots to strike from each bud along the cane. In the latter case, when the plants have begun to grow, the cane is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">cut </span><span class="font7">between plants with a spade.

<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark78"></a>The World and Her Affairs</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">E</span><span class="font7">VER since man began to multiply upon the earth, he has been shoving his neighbor about, jostling him, and endeavoring to get for himself plenty of elbow room. If there is anything a person does not like it is to be shoved around. Human history is but a series of wranglings. It seems as if the more the people knew the more they wanted to fight. Families quarreled and fought. Families grew to nations, and still they quarreled and fought. Nations leagued together, and fought other leagues of nations. One of the causes of this perpetual fussing and fighting was not always the want of elbow room, but because in the mind some crazy notion broke loose that had to be aired. Quite often that notion was clothed with a religious garb of some kind, and a supposed principle lurked in the background.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Men by nature must worship. But when they knew God, they glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish hearts were darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man, and changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshiped the creature rather than the Creator; so God gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts. (Romans 1: 21-25) God turned His back and permitted humanity to drift. God not delivering unto them His oracles, they manufactured religions of their own, with the help </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">Satan, who has always been on the job with suggestive hints as to the way it should be done. Buddhism, Hinduism, Shintoism, Mohammedanism, Taoism, Catholicism, and Protestantism—all have resulted from searching to find the face of the hidden and unknown God. {Psalm 104:29) The Mosaic law and code of morals was the true religion of Israel, but an admixture of outside religions corrupted it, and God hid His face from the Jews. The encyclopedia gives the adherents of Christianity as 600,000,000; but if there were 500,000 Christians it would be a much better world. False religions lie at the root of the world’s troubles, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and most </span><span class="font7">of it at the door of that which poses </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font7">&quot;Christian.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. H. G. </span><span class="font7">Wells </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font7">said: &quot;The great </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">war Was a necessary </span><span class="font7">consequence of the mentality </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of the period.&quot; Where did </span><span class="font7">this peculiar brand of mentality come from? It came from a hideous conception of the divine mind, from false doctrines; and nothing was more responsible than the mentality of the so-called Christian mind. The world is actuated by the unholy spirit of the devil, and mankind should shoulder the blame; for, when they knew God they glorified Him not as God. Christendom so-called is none other than devildom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Scriptures teach that the world is in its present plight because of unbelief. But the world is not lost! It has been redeemed by Christ, and awaits Jesus' co</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font7">g and kingdom when He will restore all things, bring the living to health and perfection of mind and body, and raise the dead from the grave to life, liberty </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">happiness. But before this glorious work on behalf of mankind shall progress to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">any </span><span class="font7">appreciable extent, Satan must be bound for </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">thousand years and Satan’s organization here upon the earth destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The dissolving of Satan's empire began in the World War; and there is no possible restoration of any crumbling kingdom, but rather the crushing, disintegrating process continues until all shall cease to function. The Scriptures seem to limit this transition period to eleven years, $ from 1914 to and including 1925. At this time the Lord Jesus is invisibly present bringing to naught the wisdom of the &quot;wise” men of earth, and laying the broad foundation for the age of reconstruction and reign of righteousness, for which many have prayed: &quot;Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth aa it is done in heaven.&quot; Jesus named the signs by which believers might be enabled to discern His presence. These are recorded in Matthew, 24th chapter, and these are unfolding and becoming matters of history before our very eyes. Then why are we so slow to believe! False doctrines and self-interests are in the way, and these must be gotten out of the way before the rising ofi &quot;the Sun of righteousness” shall shine into our hearts. But the rising of that Sun shall no more tarry than that of the Eteral sun. Then it becomes necessary to break the haughty spirit, crumble the ambitions, crush the pride of mankind and checkmate them in their selfish endeavors; and this work shall go on now, with increasing rapidity, until “every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that Jesus is Lord, to +he glory of God.&quot;</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>The Bat or the Bee, Which?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font7">HE bat is an animal that flies at night, but hides during the day. It is the only mammal capable of genuine flight. Its flight is noiseless. Its membrane is furry, fitted with delicate nerves enabling it, probably by the increased density of the air, instinctively to tell when it is approaching an object which should be avoided. The bat flies in perfect safety, darting here and there amidst buildings, trees, rocks, and rafters. As its ears are extremely large and sensitive, scientists think that it hears noises wholly beyond the range of the human ear. Some bats are as small as a mouse, and some have wings stretching five feet from tip to tip. There are as many species of bats as there are brands of false Christianity—about four hundred and fifty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Old World bats are both fruit and insect eaters; those of the Western Hemisphere are insect eaters. They cannot walk; they either fly, or crawl clumsily. While resting in daytime they hang upside down. The popular saying, &quot;As blind as a bat,” is founded on fact; not that the bat is stone blind, but as blind as a bat— that is, the portion of the retina which is most concerned with the perception of light is not well developed. This fact explains why nature has given to the bat such an interlocking network of nerves that by these it &quot;sees&quot; its way principally. It is said that a stone-blind bat turned loose in a room across which numerous strings have been tied will fly about and not touch one of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The bee is an insect which lives in a hive, stays in out of the dark, and roams at will in the sunlight. There are about three hundred species of the bee. Some of them are lazy: but most of them, nearly all in fact, are as busy as bees can be. The bee is valued for the honey it makes; moreover, as it flies from flower to flower, from blossom to blossom, it assists in pollenizing growing crops, making itself very useful and valuable. From the viewpoint of the bee’s sting it is not a very lovable creature, but it should be well cared for and never destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If there are any bees that need the ruthless hand of destruction to smite them, the bees themselves will see to that. The drones are the star boarders—they never work nor pay a cent; these are killed off by the worker bees at the end of the swarming season. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">If </span><span class="font7">food </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">is plentiful </span><span class="font7">and there has been prosperity in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the bee camp a </span><span class="font7">few of the star boarders will be allowed </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">hang around for another season, which </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">proves </span><span class="font7">that the bee has a heart. The worker bee is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the . </span><span class="font7">female; and she does what other good ladies are supposed to do—she makes the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">living, takes </span><span class="font7">to the combs, feeds the young, defends </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">home, and keeps it tidy. In this female </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">govern- ’ </span><span class="font7">ment the boss bee is the queen. She </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">is the A </span><span class="font7">greatest conserver in any nation; she lays </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">eggs </span><span class="font7">at the rate of 4,000 a day, producing two </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font7">three new swarms each season.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are some people like bats, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and some </span><span class="font7">like bees. To which class do we each belong?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are minds that grovel in the mire </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">human traditions so enshrouded in mystery that they are unreadable; they hang </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to the </span><span class="font7">rafters of antiquated logic and, truly, are upside down. The tragedies of life, the scandal in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">newspapers, the divorce courts, the broken con- i tracts, the horrors of war, the tales of the gos</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">sip </span><span class="font7">mongers, trashy literature, reveling in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">sorrows of others and taking their own as a -matter of course—this is their pastime. They : are insect eaters, living in the basement of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">their </span><span class="font7">minds, undermining their characters, bringing ; forth a generation like themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are others who love the sunlight, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">who </span><span class="font7">search </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font7">the sweetness </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font7">every </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">experience, </span><span class="font7">who are open-hearted, who stand </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">upright, and </span><span class="font7">who reason and philosophize, causing </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">every </span><span class="font7">sorrow to yield its honey. The romances </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of life, </span><span class="font7">the desirability and happiness of the home </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">life, </span><span class="font7">the honesty and integrity of business relations, the hallowedness of peace, the purity of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a holy 1 </span><span class="font7">atmosphere, and the things of nobility </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">occupy </span><span class="font7">their minds. They have real pleasure in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the A </span><span class="font7">success and advancement of others. They </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">cheer ; </span><span class="font7">the broken-hearted, succor the sick, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and allevi- ■ </span><span class="font7">ate the pain of body and mind of those </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">with </span><span class="font7">h whom they associate. Honey producers </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">they </span><span class="font7">are, loving the beauties of nature, reverencing ■ the Great Creator, learning His mind and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">His</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> ■ </span><span class="font7">mighty works, basking in the divine sunshine ? and radiating warmth of heavenly wisdom </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">s love everywhere.

<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>Millennium Seen in Troubles</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">R</span><span class="font7">EV.B. G. Wilkinson, of Washington, preaching in Philadelphia on “The Approaching Millennium,” said that the evidences of the approaching Millennium are seen in the troubles multiplying everywhere. He said that the time tor the coming of Christ is right upon us, that the earth will reel to and fro like a drunken man, that the great sky-scrapers will tumble down, and that everything on the earth will be displaced. The Millennium is a period of a thousand years, and is bounded on either side with a resurrection. “The American Republic,” said he, “is in the twilight of its darkest hour, and it is criminal to conceal the deadly peril of the nation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yes; the evidences everywhere abound that we are in the twilight of the darkest hour of earth’s history; but that there shall be a literal reeling of the earth is doubtful. “Earth” Scrip-turally refers to the people of the earth; they are reeling like drunken men now. The high places to be brought low are not necessarily sky-scrapers, but towering institutions of wealth, of learning, of men’s schemes. These are soon to crumble. The proud and arrogant and self-willed must be humbled; and the meek and lowly are to be elevated. Wrong is to be unseated, and righteousness enthroned in the hearts of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The reverend gentleman recognizes the first resurrection as taking place at the beginning of the 1,000-year day of Christ; but the putting the second resurrection off for a thousand years does violence to the Scriptures and outrages reason. He stumbles over a misconception of Revelation 20: 5. The church is raised instantaneously in the beginning of the Millennium to invisible, heavenly, spiritual perfection. The world is raised gradually by the process of restitution during the whole of the one thousand years to visible, human, earthly conditions. iWhen Christ begins His reign, as the Great</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Physician He cures all the sickness, therebj . stopping all the dying because of original trans- . -gression; and as the world’s Redeemer and Savior lie calls all earth’s billions out of the j sleep of death, in order that by gradually coming to mental, moral and physical perfection they may have the privilege of qualifying foi ’ -&gt; eternity, and may continue to live forever right here on the earth. (Psalm 37:29) Men need J not have fear of sky-scrapers falling upon them; but efforts should be made to be truthful, hon- i est, benevolent, kind, sympathetic, helpful to ■ , those with whom we may come in contact, that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">J. </span><span class="font7">thus we may be prepared for the favor which -God through Christ designs to give. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-2</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The evidences are manifest on every hand j that something unprecedented is in the air. It y&gt; is Christ taking unto Himself His great power and beginning His reign. As David cried to the elders of Israel: “Why are ye the last to wel- _ come back the King!” so we cry to the elders </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">t </span><span class="font7">of “Christendom” I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The Rev. C. Ernest Smith, St Thomas Episcopal Church, Washington, D. C., besides being the pastor of a fashionable church, is said to be an officer of the National Association for the Prevention of Vivisection; but this did not deter him from saying, “When a man becomes a criminal he drops below the human level and no longer has the rights of a human being,” in advocating that it was “spiritually proper” to use convicted human beings in the interest of medical science if that use would accrue to the welfare of mankind. To save animals and to make a record for himself, he would substitute human convicts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is hoped that this man’s heart is better than his tongue—that were he to have the dissecting to do he would practise on neither animal nor human. False conceptions of Christianity put wrong values upon human beings. Creedally and theoretically, a convict is destined for hell fire and brimstone, where the tortures of the damned in excruciating agonies are never lessened but augmented by reason of the lack of water for the parched tongue. But, possibly, by the slow death of vivisection the criminal, being sacrificed for the blessing of humanity, would be put in a section of hell where the fires do not rage so furiously, and thus work good in the end!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bible teaches, however, that the dead arc , dead—unconscious, awaiting the resurrection; that life is a blessing; that Christ died for all and purposes to give all an opportunity for life in His Millennial kingdom. Then, too, some “convicts” are entirely innocent of any wrongdoing; and many “criminals” have good hearts, and with proper environment would make good and useful citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Even the medical fraternity revolted at the parson’s recommendation, believing that so-ealled criminals have as great a right to live as</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark97"></a>Is the Church Abdicating?</span></h2>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">R</span><span class="font7">ECENTLY there was a heated discussion between the Chicago Methodist preachers and Nicholas Murray Butler, the latter being condemned for exercising the fundamental right of a citizen to criticize some of the laws under which he lives. Dr. Butler replied that the condemnation was an exhibition of intolerance which was both un-American and un-Christian. The New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">World,</span><span class="font7"> commenting on it, said in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;... A </span><span class="font6">popular government in which criticism has been stifled would simply cease to be popular government. . . . That the condemnation was un-Christian and irreligious may not be so clear to the Chicago Methodist Preachers’ meeting. . . . What actually happens more and more is that clergymen confess that their spiritual authority is a failure and that their main reliance is upon the police. . . . Gradually the average man begins to feel that clergymen themselves have lost faith in the power of the church and of religious tradition. He finds it increasingly difficult to think of the churches as agencies of human regeneration when the churches themselves are thinking so much about the legislatures, and inspectors, and detectives, and police courts. ... To many men it looks as if the churches were abdicating. They see churches in politics. ... It is not surprising that they begin to ask whether clergymen know as little about religion as they evidently know about politics. For when they see churches trying to use law and force for ends where custom and opinion are and must remain decisive, the scepticism about . clergymen in politics grows into scepticism about the clergymen in the pulpits. . . . No group in </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font6">erica ig more insistent than the political churchmen on the necessity of substituting law for custom, governmental decrees for example, and policemen for public opinion. If churchmen don’t believe in the power of their churches, need they be surprised if there is unbelief in the land?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What and if the editors of our metropolitan newspapers should come into the light of present truth sufficiently to see that ninety-nine percent of what is passing for Christianity is rank infidelity; that the forms, ceremonies, creeds, and general teachings are so perverted by the admixture of things heathenish, and discolored by false conceptions of what true Christianity really is, that the preachers are now fulfilling the prediction of our Lord that they would become the blind leaders of the blind!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Certain it is that the “wood, hay, stubble” of earth’s traditions have lost tneir sap and are becoming as tinder. Some agency of the Lord is expected to apply the lighted match shortly, that the mass of corrupt and superstitious theology may be consumed with an unquenchable flame which shall prepare the world for the Messianic reign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, ,</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark98"></a>Efforts to Unite Demagnetized “Churches”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font7"> &quot;WORLD church union” is being urged by prelates and representatives of practically all Protestant churches. Recently there has been a big meetin</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">g</span><span class="font7">. The world conference, accordin</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">g</span><span class="font7"> to tentative plans, will meet in Washington in 1925; and this meeting is to be the means of an official action whereby all the churches may come together on some common ground, looking toward concerted action in furthering the ideals of the Christian religion throughout the world. It is pointed out that the forthcoming conference will seek a unity of the churches, but not a uniformity of creed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How can the ideals of Christianity be furthered without a common ground of creedal understanding! Should not any unity of faith be based upon a tangible belief! The &quot;churches” are demagnetized and can never unite. It is therefore obvious that the intent is to unify the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">churches for power and not for holiness, to unite for legislative activity rather </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">than</span><span class="font7"> to be controlled by the law of Christ. The leaders may see that unless they do “some</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">thing</span><span class="font7">” their bread and butter is gone. The question then is an important one: “How may we further hoodoo the people so that they may continue to have confidence in us T We know that we are in disagreement as to doctrine; some of us believe in evolution, some of us are higher critics, some of us don’t believe the Garden of Eden story; some of us believe that Jesus was God Himself, and some of us don’t; and some of us don’t know what we believe. But we are united on one thing; that is, for the people to believe that our puzzled churches are unitedly of God’s authorization, that we are of God’s ordination, and that therefore the people should be bound to recognize us as channels of salvation I”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font7">truth is that God's church is not a building of inanimate material; God’s representatives preach the truth for the love of the truth and not for filthy lucre’s sake; they preach </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">gospel of love and good tidings and not </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a “gospel”</span><span class="font7"> of hate and bad tidings.

<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark99"></a>Russia Fighting the Churches</span></h2>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">FTHE Russian Government has been having J- trouble with the Catholic Church. A number of priests, archbishops, etc., have been imprisoned for long terms; some have been executed; and others have been driven from their homes. The priests are charged with activities against the Soviet Government and with hiding church treasure to save it from requisition by the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The clerics have evidently made themselves obnoxious to the federal authorities; for the Bolsheviki have decided on a program of persecution directed against all the Christian churches in Russia. Most of the priests are PoEsh, and in some of their acts are conducting themselves in haimony with advices received from the Vatican.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A great mistake was made in 325 A. D., when in the days of Constantine church and state were united, the church </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">aim</span><span class="font7">ing to give the state holiness and the state aiming to give the church £ power. The present troubles are the fruits of £ a long and erroneous practice. The idea that 0 the church, while still in the flesh, should rule the world is unscriptural; and for the church to rule anything in her present debased condition is irrational. Let the church purify herself —if she can; let her priests be subject to the powers that be, as the Bible says; and the troubles that harass Catholicism in Russia should soon flee away. But it is not for Rome to separate herself from the governments. Her business is politics, not religion; every ounce of her energy is expended to promote her welfare in power and great glory upon the earth, not knowing that the office and purpose of the true church in the Gospel age is to purify and</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">What the Russian Government </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">was appar- * </span><span class="font7">ently trying to do was to materially diminish the suffering from the terrible famine </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">which </span><span class="font7">s was sweeping over Russia. Why should it think j that confiscating church property for the relief of the sick and distressed from starvation was J anything but a humanitarian act? Of course ~ the churches should help in that! The decree i affected all the churches alike; there was </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">no -</span><span class="font7">difference. Vessels of gold, silver, etc., are </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font7">parts of any religion; they are merely embel- s lishments, and should be sacrificed if need </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">be V </span><span class="font7">to help the starving. Religions may flourish without these ornamentations. The people seemed willing enough for the treasures to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font7">used; but here and there opposition sprang </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">up </span><span class="font7">among the clerics who, out of the bigness </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">their hearts, should have freely given. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">j</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Catholic Church is a world organization, J a state within a state, with a system of disci- </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">s </span><span class="font7">pline as rigid as any government, having </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">its 1 </span><span class="font7">supreme ruler outside of any government. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It I </span><span class="font7">claims divine authority, and as such it is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">not <sup>7 </sup></span><span class="font7">supposed to submit to secular orders.

<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font7">N OPEN LETTER” is being circulated throughout Oklahoma by the National Council of Catholic Men. It first points out that Oklahoma follows no other state’s lead, and then shows how the solidarity of her people is of paramount importance in maintaining that greatness and conserving her </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">institutions, </span><span class="font7">saying,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Her [Oklahoma's] resources must be free alike to </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">■11</span><span class="font6">; her laws a protection alike to all; her courts open alike to all; her people must be fair, friendly, loyal and kind to all, but first and especially to each other.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The plea is made that Jews and Protestants </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">Catholics have cause in common with one another; that they should not hate one another, but must come together to make the laws; and that they should be united and bound together </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in one </span><span class="font7">common stewardship. All of this is very good and proper. But why the necessity of the reminder </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font7">The letter says further:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“We who write these lines are Catholics. We are less than one-fortieth of the population of the state. Our lives, </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">out</span><span class="font6"> liberties, our property, our reputation are in your trust and keeping. But in </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">out joint</span><span class="font6"> keeping, men of Oklahoma, are the lives, liberties, properties and reputation of </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">all</span><span class="font6"> the people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then, according to this, the Protestants of Oklahoma are murderers, bandits, thieves, and slanderers 1 Otherwise, why should Catholics have to plead for the privilege of unmolested citizenship I</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then follow twenty things which &quot;Catholics do not believe”; that the Pope has temporal rights in America, that the Pope claims their political allegiance, that the Pope nullifies laws and oaths or contracts at will, that Protestant husbands and wives are living in adultery, that Protestants may be hated or persecuted, etc. And last, follow the things &quot;they are required”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">to do; that they respect rulers, honestly render their property for taxation, never tell a lie, never defraud their neighbors; “they are not permitted to do malice to any human being, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font7">life, limb, liberty or estate, in friends, family &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">or reputation, by deed or word, upon any pre- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jS</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">text or for any cause,” etc. &quot;Catholics are told to read the Scriptures; to read them frequently;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">to read them reverently, as the Word of God, - g and not to deny or doubt aught contained J therein.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Are not these Catholics claiming too much for themselves? Do not the good people </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">Oklahoma live too near the Mexican boundary to be deceived by smoothness of speech? Is not the history of South </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font7">erica, Spain and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Aus</span><span class="font7">tria such as to belie even claims of equality in spirituality, honesty, and intelligence </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">with </span><span class="font7">Protestant countries?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Catholics generally are overhearing in politics, self-assertive in civic righteousness, dogmatic on who shall teach the children, self-conceited in the superiority of the Catholic religion, proud of their hospitals, and overjoyed in their numerical strength in thousands of police forces and court justices. In Spain and other countries they look with disdain upon anything Protestant, and with commendable perseverance bide their time when they may have majorities everywhere to dominate and control everything—on behalf of the Pope, who is God’s representative here on earth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If Catholics are drawing a religious line it is well that Oklahoma has its eyes open to thwart any political move of the Papal hierarchy. If the Catholics of Oklahoma would content themselves with being just common people, fakin</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">g </span><span class="font7">everything in common with the rest of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">inhabitants, there should be no excuse for open letters.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">P</span><span class="font7">ALMER,” said Tyler, “the other day in a discussion you said you believed in the story of the Garden of Eden. Wynn says the statement made in Genesis is an allegory. I should like to know which is right. How can you expect me to believe when Christians disagree!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;I accept the creation of man and the Garden of Eden record because they are essential to a harmonious understanding of the Bible and its teachings as a whole,” said Palmer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I would like to know what Wynn has to say on this question; for it seems strange to me that he should hold modern views, while you, a Bible student and one always ready to give a reason for what you believe, should have the old ones,” said Tyler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I don’t care to talk about these things,” replied Wynn; &quot;but since you put it in that way, I might say that experts in textual criticism, students of history, doctors of divinity and others now agree that much of the Old Testament is folk-lore, legends handed down from one generation to another,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Yes,” replied Tyler; “but there must be a reason for the existence of these stories, some substratum of truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Sin and misery are in the world; therefore the question naturally arises, What is the cause!” answered Wynn. “What better or i.&lt; more reasonable explanation than that man has disobeyed God! To be in harmony with God is happiness; to be banished from Him, misery. This concept has been expressed in the form of the Garden of Eden story to impress this lesson upon the minds of men when they were but children in the school of knowledge ; a fable or parable beautifully portraying this sublime truth. I leave it there; to me the explanation is reasonable and sufficient.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“It sounds all right,” said Tyler. “What 'do you say to that, Palmer!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“A fanciful, unwarranted interpretation, which is contradicted by the whole tenor of Scripture,” he replied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;How do you explain it, then!” asked Tyler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;I don’t explain it, I accept it as a literal statement of fact,” answered Palmer,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Yes; but you must have a reason for doing so.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>,f</sup>Before giving my reasons, I would like to ask Wynn a few questions,” said Palmer. “First, do you believe that man was originally created perfect, and that he fell from this through sin!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“It depends on the way one looks at it,” replied Wynn. I believe man was created, or rather is being created, by a process of evolution.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I agree with you there,” put in Tyler. “But I never thought of harmonizing it with the Bible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;But do you believe that man was made perfect and was able to perfectly keep a perfect law!” continued Palmer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;I believe,” said Wynn, encouraged by the support of Tyler, &quot;that there came a time in the course of the evolution of man when he first felt the promptings of conscience, and that he acted contrary to these and thus sinned.’* .</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">&quot;You do not believe that he fell from perfection, then!&quot; queried Palmer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;No; if he fell at all, it was upward.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Do you accept the teachings of Scripture!&quot; was Palmer’s next question. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;Oh, yes; but I think we have sufficient in the New Testament for us without trying to unravel the mysteries of the Old.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“You accept the teachings of Jesus and His apostles as being inspired!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Yes, I accept them as the truth.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;I am glad of that. Jesus said: ‘The Son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister, and to give his life a ransom.' What does this mean!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“That’s right! </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font7">could </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">never understand </span><span class="font7">that,” put in Tyler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“If you admit that man was created </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">perfect, </span><span class="font7">in order to be consistent you must admit the rest. You must have the whole in order to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font7">a part, and not a part without the whole. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">If </span><span class="font7">Adam was created perfect, it is only reasonable to conclude that God would give him a </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">perfect </span><span class="font7">home, an environment in every way adapted </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">his requirements, and not permit him to roam abroad in the inhospitable earth. Have you noticed how particular the language of Genesis is on this point? ‘God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and placed there the man whom he had made’.”</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19230606_files/g_E_19230606-17.png" alt="" style="width:35pt;height:202pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">“I suppose it means that Jesus gave Himself for the sin of the world,” replied Wynn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘Yes; if it means anything, it means that the life of Jesus was to be offered as an offset for ‘ sin. The word ransom is the translation of two Greek words, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">anti-lutron,</span><span class="font7"> meaning a corresponding price. A corresponding price for what! The Scriptures everywhere present the thought that if man is to be brought into harmony with God, a sin-offering is necessary. The doctrine of substitution, if you like.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘Yes; but what of that!” said Wynn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;This: If man has not fallen, but has been steadily progressing through the centuries, then commendation and not condemnation should be his portion; life, and not death, his reward. Don’t you see that if man was never perfect, and has not fallen, then the central teaching of the New Testament, which you profess to accept as inspired, is utterly wrong! Justice could not condemn, nor could God receive a sacrifice in respect to man, in that case. The apostle Paul plainly states the truth on this, in Romans 5:12: Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men*; and again in the 18th verse: ‘Therefore, as by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even BO by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life*.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“That’s a good point,” broke in Tyler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&lt; ‘Well,” replied Wynn, “supposing we admit that man was created perfect I don’t see that we must admit that the Garden of Eden story is to be taken as literal. It seems to me foolish to think that death has come upon all men | because Adam ate an apple.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;And how about the apple!” asked Tyler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;First,” replied Palmer with a smile, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;the </span><span class="font7">Bible does not say it was an apple. It might just as likely have been a grape. In order </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">appreciate properly the test placed upon the first man, it is necessary to have the answer to another question. What was God’s purpose in creating man!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“To enjoy himself,” answered Smith, who had been quietly listening to the discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“That man might prepare himself for a future life,” said Wynn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“What do you say, Tyler!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;I don’t know,” he replied; “it is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a puzzle to </span><span class="font7">me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“In the work of creation God had brought forth many beings on the earth, all unintelli-gently fulfilling His will. In man God determined to have a nobler thing, a being who would serve Him from choice and be His representative on the earth. He desires men to worship Him in spirit and in truth,” said P</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">alm</span><span class="font7">er. “To serve God intelligently, from choice and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font7">of necessity, implies that man must be endowed with certain special qualities and powers of mind. He must have conscience, that faculty by which he is able to determine between right and wrong; and he must have freedom of choice, volition, the power to choose either.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;Whether you admit this to be God’s purpose or not, the fact remains that man possesses these qualities, and their possession implies their use; for God never created a thing for no purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;How was man to use the powers of conscience and volition? If he had been created and given life without any conditions, then there was nothing that he could do which would be wrong. Conscience would be a superfluous power. But the moment that God said man was not to eat of the fruit of a certain tree on penalty of death, the dormant faculty of conscience sprang into action. To obey he could see was right, and to disobey wrong. Only </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">simple test, but sufficient for the purpose.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19230606_files/g_E_19230606-18.png" alt="" style="width:33pt;height:401pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">“One day his wife Eve, having succumbed to the temptation of the adversary, came and offered the fruit to Adam. He must now exercise volition; he must choose between right and wrong. The result you know. Thus we see by this simple means the powers of the perfect man were brought into operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“To see the importance in the scheme of Scripture which the doctrines of the creation of man and of original sin occupy, it is necessary to take a comprehensive view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Briefly it is this: Adam was created perfect; he sinned and incurred the penalty of death, which sentence passed upon all his posterity. Tn Adam all die.’ In due time Jesus the Son of God came to earth, became flesh in order to die on behalf of the race. One man had sinned; : one man only was necessary to redeem </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font7"> and his family. God could therefore accept the sac- ' rifice of Jesus as an offset or corresponding price for Adam. If each member of the human . race had been sentenced individually, each would have required an individual redeemer. How economical is God’s way I 'By a man came death, by a man comes the resurrection of the i dead. As in Adam all die, even so </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in Christ </span><span class="font7">shall all be made alive.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I cannot leave the subject without pointing . out the logical conclusion to this: All died </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font7">one; all are redeemed through one. Every, member of Adam’s fa</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">mil</span><span class="font7">y must therefore </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">re- <sub>; </sub></span><span class="font7">ceive an opportunity of life. The vast majority, have not had this in the past, they must get </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font7">in the future, during the reign of Christ. :</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“You see, then, that the plan of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">God for man is </span><span class="font7">based upon the sacrifice of Jesus. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">You must </span><span class="font7">also see how essential is the acceptance of the truth of the creation of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">man and the story of ' </span><span class="font7">the Garden of Eden in order to understand inteln ligently the principles underlying that </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">plan.* <sub>t</sub></span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark100"></a>Great Men and Women of the Old Testament</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ODAY we briefly review those great men and women of Old Testament days whose lives are so profitable for our Instruction In righteousness. (Romans 15:4) They began with </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Abbaham,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> the father of them that believe, a generous, noble character whom God used as a figure of himself. (Romans 4:17) Abraham was the first called to live the life of faith, and so truly did he live that life It may be said Its record la like a deep well out of which his children may draw refreshing waters for their soul. (1 Peter 1: fi) Abraham clearly saw that God had separated him and Ms children to himself, and he determined to live before God accordingly. (Genesis 18:17,18) No doubt by his removal to Canaan from Ur of the Chaldees God purposed to separate Abraham from the world's spirit; for the bold spirit of man yras more developed In Babylonia than tn Canaan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">’God covenanted with Abraham that through him should eome the seed promised in Eden; that ha and his seed were ultimately to bless all the families of the earth. (Genesis B:15; 12:1-3) The attitude of men towards Abraham and his seed is the determining factor In their relationship with Ged. Tribulation follows persecution or rejection of the ■eed, and blessing follows favor towards and final acceptance of the seed. “I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curaeth thee.” (Genesis 12:8) The outstanding feature of Abraham’s life Is his faith. But no man can continue in faith apart from loyalty to God. Thera must ha the exercise of the will to be loyal and faithful, and It was the loyalty In Abraham which enabled his faith to rise to seemingly unscalable heights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">•Joseph:</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> From Abraham we pass on to his most noted great-grandson Joseph, who in contempt was called “the dreamer.” His dreams, however, had a great effect upon his ' life; for In the providence of God he through them was stimulated to a practical life, which ultimately made him . -the preserver of his father’s family tnd of the Egyptian people. Although cut off from home and the land of prom- ' Ise, and separated from every member of his family, Joseph ; knew that ha was in the care of God; and he worked and ,? waited. Energetic, and swift in judgment, loyal to God, and true to the covenant, Joseph was a worthy son of those who :.i held the promises. His life gives US a grand example of t patient loyalty to God under great temptation to rebellion ; of heart, and of great faithfulness under powerful tempt** 5 tlons to develop the spirit of Egypt</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup>It is in Joseph we first have the fact revealed that God has a firstborn even In Israel, who saves, first hlr brethren ; and then the world. He Is a type of the Christ separated . unto God. His life Is a grand example to the church, whose motives and service must also be misunderstood In order ' that necessary testings may come. Joseph’s reward is typl- -cal of theirs; they are to have the blessings of heaven to &gt;&nbsp;bestow on their brethren, earthly Israel, and upon the world pf mankind, represented by Egypt</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mo»e» Trained from Youth &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">M</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">OSES: Abraham was called of God sometime between ) his fiftieth and his seventy-fifth year. Joseph began to ' dream when he was a boy, and his separation from his -5: home was when he was seventeen years of age. But Mosea was separated from his family and put under training for God when he was yet In his cradle. There was a special ■ work for him and he needed to be specially prepared. God’s place for Moses has no comparison among men; and God therefore caused him to have his earliest training In the Egyptian palace where, separated from his brethren, he yet lived amongst them. Learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians (of which wisdom and knowledge the world Is now beginning to understand a little), and full of desires for his Ill-used people, Moses early thought to be their helper. But by keeping him back for forty years God taught him that it was not in human wisdom nor by man’s strength, hut by divine call and power that his servants do his work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“In due time Moses led Israel out of Egypt and unto their land of hope. The suffering of Israel In Egypt, their cry, and their deliverance, and ultimate blessing and rest In the land of promise are pantomimic representations of the suffering of mankind under the dominion of Satan (who like Pharaoh has the power of death), and of their deliverance by God through the greater Moses, and of the final rest and blessing which shall be theirs under the rule of the kingdom of heaven. In Moses' patient care for God’s people, in his life of self-sacrifice, and in his meekness (Numbers 12:3) while holding the position of the greatest service given by God to any of his people, the children of faith have some of God’s best examples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">rituTH: To Ruth is another long step in Israel’s history. The sweet story of Ruth, coming immediately after the Book of Judges with its rather painful record of failures In Israel, Is a pleasant relief. Israel produced some of the best women the world has known, but Ruth was of the daughters of Moab. Her story shows that good dispositions were to be found outside the chosen people, and that the outside nations were not wholly deteriorated. The few from amongst the nations who joined themselves to the commonwealth of Israel and thus became partakers of the blessings of Israel are but first-fruits of the many who are yet to come to God through Israel. Nor are they merely typical of the many who are to know God; for the resurrection is real, the ransom is for all, and Jesus Is Lord of the dead (Romans 14:9) and will bring the dead back to life that they may hear his word and live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“The story of Ruth tells of providential care of God over his own and over those who are joined to his people. Ruth's devotion to Naomi led to her faith in Naomi’s God, and to a position of honor amongst Naomi’s people to which few could attain. Ruth Is a sweet and beautiful type of the devoted servant and lover of Christ, who toils In love, who thinks little of himself, who puts forward a claim to high estate as modestly as Ruth put forward her claim to Boaz, and who at the end is rewarded to a high place of favor, even as Ruth was rewarded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Samuel, a Man of Prayer</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">S</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">AMUEL: Samuel was to Israel as a second Moses. In his days the life of the people was very low from every point of view. The Philistines oppressed them, their priesthood was corrupt, and there was no spirit In them. But God, who never forsakes his people, even in their deepest extremity was preparing for their help. Hannah, the childless wife of Elkanah the Levite, prayed earnestly for a son, and vowed him to God. She little thought how much her trial was to be to the glory of God, or how much her prayers were to be of service to Israel. Hannah’s prayer was granted, and Samuel was born and was given to the service of Jehovah,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>lo</sup>God often has his people In travail for purposes other than their own development. From boyhood to the last days of a long life the chief note of Samuel's life was his waiting upon God in prayer. God used him as n boy to foretell the {downfall of Ell’s house and the fall of Shiloh, and as a young man to reinvigorate the national life of Israel and then, when the people wanted a king, to anoint Saul, and afterwards David. Samuel was the first of the regular series of the prophets of Israel. From his day onward God always had someone by whom he spoke to the kings or tn the people. Here again Is a record of a devoted life With absolutely no thought of using his privilege for himself. The hallmark of acceptable service Is upon Samuel, wholehearted, unselfish service for the glory of God nnd for the good of God's people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">’’David : </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">That God knew Israel would desire a kingdom is clear from Deuteronomy 17:14-20, which passage gives no intimation that such arrangement would be contrary to the will of God. But It was by a fault in Israel that the kingdom was first established under Saul. Abraham, the holder of the promises to Israel, is to be a world-blesser; but before blessings can come there are enemies to be conquered—a rule of righteousness must be established. God rejected Saul because of his wilfulness, and made David king and the type of the king to be. From a boy David’s heart v as set upon God; as a youth he kept God before tim, as the meditations of his heart revealed In the Psalma clcnrly show ; as king, shining out beyond all h-man defects, is his unswerving loyalty to God. A real student of tha Word of God, be saw himself one specially favored of God; and he used his opportunities to exalt Israel’s God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">’’Despite defects it can be truly said that righteousneso governed his life. He conquered the enemies of Israel who yet dwelt in the land given to Abraham by promise; and he gathered the material to adorn the temple of God, as well as ordered the temple service. The early trials of David, his clean, straight character, his courage, tenderness, nnd forbearance, are examples for the church of God in their schooling in life and in meeting the difficulties and trials of their time of probation ere they become joint-heirs on the tlirone of Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>1</sup>’Elijah : </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The glory of the God of Israel was dear to David’s heart, and he must have thought when the temple and Its service was established that Israel would rejoice In God forever. But the causes of failure which swept Shiloh away w<sup>T</sup>ere not removed from the hearts of Israel. After Solomon’s death the tribes quarreled, the kingdom wu divided, Idolatry was openly set up in the northern kingdom, and indifference to God with much hypocrisy ob</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">tain</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">e</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">d </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in Judah. In course of time the northern kingdom easily slipped away from the worship of the golden calves to the worship of Baal with all its abominations. Then God raised up his servant Elijah to cleanse Israel from this awful thing. Elijah, unknown till by reason of his earnest prayer to God through the longing or his heart for the salvation of his people from Baal worship, Js brought to a great place in their history. A persistent, bold, fearless man, he served God well. But a sudden fear caused him to leave his work just when success seemed almost gained. Jezebel threatened his life, and he fled. His failure Is merely recorded. Comment is not made upon It; for God would not dishonor his servant who had cared so much for his praise; and Elijah’s name is great In both houses of Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup>At the end God rewarded Elijah with giving him a wonderful climax to his ministry. This honored servant of God tells us by his name (Jehovah la God) and by his great work just what our work is today. Again it Is necessary to affirm to all Christendom that Jehovah is God. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">YaJvtoeh, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the translation now used Instead of Jehovah, is declared by nearly all teachers in Christendom to be only the tribal God of Israel—which is exactly what the priests of Baal said. We declare that the God of Israel Jehovah Is also the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.—Psalm 1001 3; 83:18.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Literary Genius of Israel</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SAIAH: After the death of the prophets Elijah and Elisha Jehovah began to take a different way In dealing with his people. The holy spirit came upon holy men; and they wrote the words of God, messages which were intended to help the people to whom they spoke, but which, also were to stand for later days. Of the writing or literary prophets Isaiah Is the chief. He was raised up when a crisis in the kingdom of Judah was approaching. His “Here am I, send me,” when tn the vision he saw and heard the Lord In the temple, is the special note of his life—willing, faithful service continued to the end of his days. It was his mission to preach against the attitude of his people towards God; to tear from them the cloak of hypocrisy, and to declare a coming desolation on Judah and Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">’“Isaiah knew from his vision that his message would not he received; but that fact did not deter him. He snw that only a few wanted the truth; but he knew that God would not fall In his purposes, that there would be a remnant of faithful ones, and that out of apparently dead things life would spring forth. He faithfully proclaimed the truth of the coming desolation, and then of Babylon’s fall. Jehovah declared through him the restitution (1) of Israel (Isaiah 40) ; (2) of a special remnant of faithful ones, composed of the feet members of the church under the direct control of the returned Lord (Isaiah 52:7), who would be God’s last messenger to the church and the world; and (3) of the world of mankind, the redeemed of the Lord.—Isaiah 85.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>1t</sup>Jeeemiah:</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> After Isaiah the most notable prophet of the Lord was Jeremiah. So special was the work that was necessary to be done in. Jerusalem In Its last days, and ere Its fall came, that God specially raised up a servant for the work. Jeremiah was told for his encouragement that God knew him before his birth. (Jeremiah 1:5) He was one of the most devoted servants of God of whom we have a record. His period of at least forty years of service was done under most difficult conditions; for he had not only to proclaim the downfall of his beloved city and the desolation of the then ecclesiastical establishment, but to speak this to a people who because of their pride were blinded in hypocrisy. But part of his mission was to tell of the deliverance from captivity after the allotted period, and also of the inauguration of the new covenant in later days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">’’Tradition has it that Jeremiah lost his life in the faithful service of his Master. The hardness of a heart steeped In mere profession and in error is like that of Pharaoh; it has to be broken before God's mercy can And a way in. Jeremiah’s appealing voice, manner, and tears seemed to avail nothing; the people went on in their way, and perished. Perhaps more than any other servant Jeremiah typifies the work of the church In these days, when Christendom Is about to be destroyed. Like him the consecrated are now called upon to proclaim that the time has come when the destroying power will surely prevail, and that Christendom will be swept from the earth as surely as Jerusalem and what It stood for were swept away when Nebuchadnezzar took the city and left the land a desolation. Jeremiah tells us much of his feeling; he was often sore at heart, but so clear-sighted that he never flinched. He was &amp;&nbsp;bold man of faith and action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Now, in the “Day of the Lord&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">N</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">EHEMIAH: While all of the Bible has in some measure served all of God’s people, it Is dear to the Bible student that its messages whether of prophecy or in type are specially applicable to &quot;the day of the Lord,” that day of which the prophets wrote and spoke so much. That “day of the Lord” is from 187S on; but Its light and Its message* have been clearer and more pointed since 1918,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">’“Nehemiah, who served his people In the restoration period, seems specially set forth as an example and guide to the consecrated In these last days. The days wherein, the church may work for the Lord, the days of witnessing to the establishment of the kingdom, and of rebuilding th* walls of the city of truth, are almost ended. There la atlU much work to be done, and to be done quickly because of the enemies of truth and of God. We do well to copy Nehemiah’s example in urgency, and get the Lord’s work done while the days are favorable, and before the time of our change comes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>21</sup>Estheb:</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Though our study of Esther followed Nehemiah, she preceded him in time by thirty to forty years. The influence of Esther and Mordecai remained in PerSia, and made it comparatively easy for Nehemiah to get a commission to build the walls of the city. (Daniel 9:25) The scenes of the book of Esther are altogether outside the land of promise; but It has a necessary place in the purpose of God, and its lessons in trust In God’s overruling care are very helpful. Esther and her uncle Mordecai in the land of captivity were faithful to the Jewish hope. Trained by Mordecai from earliest days she was, in the days of her exaltation as queen of Persia, willing to sacrifice even life Itself for her people’s sake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">’’Prayer is not mentioned in the book; for evidently it was the holy spirit’s purpose to have the name of God left out, and God must have been mentioned bad there been any mention of prayer. But neither prayer, nor the name of God, nor the hope of Israel, nor the land of promise is mentioned in this strange but wonderful interesting record; aud for the reason that the book symbolizes the dark period at the dose of this present evil age, when the powers that he will have done whatever they find possible to wipe out the name of God and his worship. But Esther means “a star,” and she fitly represents the faithfulness of those who are to shine as stars in God’s firmament. In the new heavens.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark101"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark102"></a>STUDIES IN THE “HARP OF GOD” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">( <sup>,UE&gt;&lt;</sup>LA'n^T<sup>H</sup>BQOK<sup>tD</sup>*<sup>9</sup> )</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">With Issue Number 60 we began running Judge Rutherford’s new book, “The Harp of God”, with accompanying questions, taking the place of both Advanced and Juvenile Bible Studies which have been hitherto published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">’•’When Jesus appeared at the age of thirty years, John the Baptist pointing to Him said: “Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.” (John 1:29) And we read in the Bible concerning our Lord Jesus, that He is “the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.” (Revelation 13:8) These scriptures and others show that the sacrifice of the lamb foreshadowed the sacrifice of the great One who should become the Redeemer of mankind and take away the sin of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">”*A few days after this passover in Egypt, the Israelites were all delivered when God commanded Moses to smite the waters of the Red Sea and they passed over on dry land; and when the Egyptians attempted to follow they were swallowed up in the sea and drowned. The deliverance of Israel here pictured the deliverance from the great enemy, Satan and death, of all the human race that will ultimately be obedient to God's holy will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>19,</sup>After the children of Israel were on the other side of the Red Sea, they marched on in the desert; and when they came to Mount Sinai God made with them a covenant, which is known in the Bible as the law covenant. In connection with this covenant animals were sacrificed. This covenant was instituted at the hands of Moses as a mediator. Moses here was a type of Christ Jesus, who in due time will make a covenant on behalf of all mankind for their deliverance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>loa</sup>In connection with the law given to the Israelites at this time, God instructed Moses to erect in the wilderness a tabernacle, which was to be used by the Israelites in connection with their ceremonies of sacrifice. One day of each year was known as the atonement day, and what was done on that day particularly foreshadowed the great sin-offering to be made on behalf of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1S3</sup>The tabernacle was constructed of two parts. It was forty-five feet long, fifteen feet wide, and fifteen feet high, built of boards and then covered over with a tent of three thicknesses of material. The first division of the tabernacle was called the Holy. It was fifteen feet wide and thirty feet long. The second or rear apartment was known as the Most Holy, it being fifteen feet long, fifteen feet wide, and fifteen feet high—an exact cube. The tabernacle was situated inside of a court or yard, which was seventy-five feet wide and one hundred and fifty feet in length. The fence enclosing this court was made of linen curtains, suspended from hooks which were fastened on wooden posts, the posts being set in copper sockets at the base.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>,94</sup>0n the atonement day the high priest took a bullock, which must be without spot or blemish. Inside of the court he killed the bullock, took its blood in a vessel, went from the court into the Holy and from there into the Most Holy, and sprinkled the blood upon the mercy seat, which was in the Most Holy. Then he went back and slew a male goat, which likewise must be without defect, and did the same thing with its blood. This was known as the atonement sacrifice. (See Leviticus 16:1-34) It was an offering for sin, made for the people of Israel, but in fact foreshadowing the great sin-offering that is to take away the sin of the world.</span></p>
