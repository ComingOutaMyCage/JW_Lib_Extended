<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">THIS JOURNAL AND ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font4">HIS journal is one of the prime factors or instruments in the system of Bible instruction, or “Seminary Extension”, now being presented in all parts of the civilized world by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, chartered A. D. 1884, “For the Promotion of Christian Knowledge”. It not only serves as a class room where Bible students may meet in the study of the divine Word but also as a channel of communication through which they may be reached with announcements of the Society’s conventions and of the coming of its traveling representatives, styled “Pilgrims”, and refreshed with reports of its conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our “Berean Lessons” are topical rehearsals or reviews of our Society’s published Studies most entertainingly arranged, and very helpful to all who would merit the only honorary degree which the Society accords, viz., </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Verbi Dei Minister</span><span class="font4"> (V. D. M.)» which translated into English is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Minister of God’s Word.</span><span class="font4"> Our treatment of the International Sunday School Lessons is specially for the older students an teachers. By some this feature is considered indispensable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This journal stands firmly for the defense of the only true foundation of the Christian’s hope now being so generally repudiated —redemption through the precious blood of “the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ransom</span><span class="font4"> [a corresponding price, a substitute] or all”. (1 Peter 1 : 19 ; 1 Timothy 2 : 6) Building up on this sure foundation the gold, silver and precious stones (1 Corinthians 3 : 1113; 2 Peter 1:5-11) of the Word of God, its further mission is to “make all see what is the fellowship of the mystery which. . Jias been hid in God, ... to the intent that now might be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of God”—“which in other ages was not made known unto tl sons of men as it is now revealed”.—Ephesians 3:5-9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It stands free from all parties, sects and creeds of men, while it seeks more and more to bring its every utterance i-ito finest subjection to the will of God in Chn&amp;t, as expressed in the holy Scriptures. It is thus free to declare boldlv v\hat&lt;oe\er the &gt;&nbsp;&gt;rd lmih spoken—according to the divine wisdom granted unto us to understand his utterances. Its attitude is not dogmatic, Inn co-inu. it; fur we know whereof we affirm, treading implicit faith upon the sure promises of God. It is hob] as a trust, to be mustered in His service; hence our dciinons relative to wh..t may and what may not appear in its columns must be according to our ji i.i -nt of iia good pleasure, the teaching of his Word, for the upbuilding of his people in grace and knowledge. And we not only invite but urge cur readers to prove all its utterances by the infallible Word to which reference is constantly made to facilitate such testing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">TO US TEE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That the church is “the temple of the living God”, peculiarly “his workmanship” ; that its construction has been in progress throughout the gospel age—ever since Christ became the world’s Redeemer and the Chief Corner Stone of his temple, through which, wi a finished, Gods bles.ing shall come “to all people”, and they find access to him.—1 Corinthians 3:16, 17; Ephesians 2:20-22; Genesis 28:14; Galatians 3:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">STha. ..uptime the chiseling, shaping, and polishing of consecrated believers in Christ’s atonement for sin, progress ; and when the of these “living stones”, “ ’oct and previous,” shall hare been made ready, the great Master Workman wdl bring all logclh r i.i the List resurrection: and the temple shall be filled with his glory, and be the meeting ’place between God and men threuguout t..e Millennium.— Revelation 15:5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That the basis of hope, for the church and the world, lies in the fact that “Jesus Christ, by the rnve of God. tasted death for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">every </span><span class="font4">i n.” “a ransom for all,” and wi.l be 'the true light which lighteth </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">every man that comclh into the icoila.’.</span><span class="font4"> “in due tune”.— Hebrews 2:9; John 1: 9 ; 1 Timothy 2 : 5, G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That The hope of the church is that she inav be like her Lord, “see him as he is,” be ‘partaker of the divine nature,’ and share his g.ory a-j jjoiiit-I.cir—I John 3:2; John 17:24; Romans 8:17; 2 I'cler 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That the present mission of the church is the perfecting of the saints for the future work of service; to develop in his every grace; to he God's wita.ivs to the world ; and to prepare to be kings and priests in the next age.—Ephcsm-s 4:12, y.uiia'W 21: 14 ; Revelation 1:6; 20 : 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That Hie hope lor the wc'Id lies in the blessings of knowledge and opportunity to be brought to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font4"> by Christ’s Millennial reign, the restitution of that which was that w lost in Adam, to all the willing and Gbedieat.’ at the hands ol their Redeemer anc Ins giunucti ehuicjL</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark3"></a>VIEWS FROM THE WATCH TOWER</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?”—Luke 18: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE evidence is overwhelming proving the second presence of our Lord. He has been present since 1874, conducting his harvest work. From time to time since then, students of the Scriptures have observed the fulfilment of his words above quoted. From time to time The Watch Tower deems it proper to call attention to some of these fulfilments of prophecy, showing how the clergy and the principal men in the church nominal have departed from the faith once delivered to the saints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the League of Nations compact was formulated in 1919, the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America called upon the people of the earth to support it and hailed it as the savior of mankind, employing the statement: “It is the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth.” The American people repudiated the League of Nations at the polls; but the professional politicians, big business and big preachers are still trying to inveigle the people of this land into the League. A press despatch from Washington under date of May 31, 1923, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“A call to 125,000 congregations in America to rally to the support of President Harding’s proposal that the United States enter the Permanent Court of International Justice was issued here today by the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America. With the Federal Council are affiliated thirty communions with an adult membership of more than 20,000,000 persons.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This Council wholly ignores the Scriptures and the Lord’s kingdom as remedies for the ills of mankind. Another evidence of the rapid disintegration of Satan’s empire!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">FUNDAMENTALISTS AND INFIDELS</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are yet a few men of the various nominal church organizations who believe the Bible. These are now seeing, all too late, that the wave of higher criticism and of evolution which has been sweeping over the church for a generation has brought rampant infidelity, modernism, into full control of church affairs. The Baptists have just been having evidence of this in their convention at Atlantic City.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">President W. H. P. Faunce, of Brown University, Providence, R. I., one of the institutions where modern infidels are educated for the pulpit, was on the program to speak to the 3,200 delegates. Dr. John Roach Straton, of New York, arose and protested against his appearance on the ground that he was substantially an infidel. But the protest was without avail. The majority of the convention was overwhelmingly in favor of the modern infidel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Fundamentalists hold to four principles as essential; the virgin birth of Christ, the inspiration of the Scriptures, Christ’s vicarious atonement for sin, and his promise of a second advent. The Modernists (infidels) deny these propositions. The Fundamentalists had intended asking the convention to make some statement of its standing upon these four points, but gave it up when they saw’ that they were hopelessly outnumbered. The question that arises is, Why do Christian men continue to meet with an infidel organization, and to give it their support? Why not obey the Lord and come out?—Revelation 18:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESBYTERIANS IN TROUBLE, TOO</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The same issue which has ruined the Baptist denomination is destroying Presbyterianism also. In 1910 the Presbyterians at their annual assembly agreed that the literal inspiration of the Scriptures, the virgin birth, the vicarious sacrifice, the resurrection of Jesus, and the performance of miracles are essential doctrines of the Presbyterian church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now’ it happens that the Reverend Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick, who is a Baptist and a professor in the infidel Union Theological Seminary of New York, is also a special preacher in the First Presbyterian church of New York. A year ago he delivered a sermon in New York in which he expressed his unbelief in the virgin birth of the Savior, the inspiration of the Scriptures, the atonement, and the second coming of Christ. New York was satisfied; but Philadelphia Presbyterians objected and took the case to the Presbyterian Assembly, which met at Indianapolis, May 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the Assembly William Jennings Bryan, through the power which he has of swaying audiences, succeeded by a vote of 439 to 359 in the attempt to have Dr. Fosdick reproved; but his own attempt to have the Assembly agree that no part of the educational fund should to be paid to any school that teaches or permits to be taught as a proved fact either Darwinism, or any other evolutionary hypothesis that links man in blood relationship with any other form of life, went down into defeat. It is apparent that the general sympathy of this Assembly was with the infidel view, and only the oratory of a layman prevented a scene like that at Atlantic City. Even as it was, sixty-six of the leaders at Indianapolis filed a protest against the Assembly’s action in condemning the doctrines of Dr. Fosdick. It is claimed in the newspapers that at Indianapolis there were two evolutionists to every believer in the Scriptural origin of man. At the conclusion of the session Will H. Hays, president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, made an eloquent plea that the preachers should have more money, claiming that they were paid about the same as garbage collectors. Our own opinion is that as a choice between garbage collectors and exponents of Evolution versus the Bible, the garbage collectors are many times more beneficial to mankind. One is collecting garbage, and the other distributing it.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">3U</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">The South wakes more slowly than the West. In some sections it is still at the hell-fire stage, not having learned as yet that it is in the efi'ort to escape this very dilemma that the denial of the Bible has come about. Thus on May 19, at Montreat, N. C., the Reverend It. C. Reed, of the Columbia, S. C., Presbyterian Theological Seminary, delivered a red-hot sermon on the text, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“I </span><span class="font7">am tormented in this flame.” (Luke 1G: 21) If the Reverend Reed will send to us, we will supply him with a clear and convincing explanation of this parable, in which he will see that his torment is unnecessary. It is the Jew that has been tormented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">EPISCOPALIANS AND THE FEDURAL COUNCIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Protestant Episcopal church has been in session at Garden City, and has before it the proposition whether, at the World Conference on church union, to be held in Washington in 1925, the primary question should be whether the church should have a creed at all; and, secondly, whether the Nicene Creed should be the expression of its faith. Very evidently the drift of most clergymen is toward having no creed at all; for the good and sufficient reason that most of them now know and are constantly admitting in their discourses that they have no faith at all, and are not Christians at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the Garden City conference it was agreed that during the next twelve months the clergy will press forward a series of regional conferences whereby the American public shall become more favorable to church unity; and the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America is to be approached with a view to cooperation in the program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Federal Council adds a touch of the ridiculous to the church situation when it boasts, as it has recently done, that America is getting more religious because the last year has witnessed an increase of 1,220,428 members over the previous year. If the ministers that serve these church members are infidels, what are the church members themselves? And does it surely mean that the United States is becoming more religious because it has more people who pretend to believe what they do not at all believe? The Federal Council claims a Roman Catholic baptized profession of 18.104,804; a Protestant membership of 21,451,080, of which about eighty percent are affiliated with the Council; and then it makes the whole country over into a community of saints by saying that in the supreme hours of life or death the facts will show that there are in the United States:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SUNDAY SCHOOLS COLLAPSING</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Charles A. Selden, in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Ladies Home Journal</span><span class="font7"> for May, calls attention to the fact that millions who are enrolled in the Sunday schools are learning practically nothing; that the Sunday school “is a failure as a feeder of the church, primarily because it is even more of a failure as a school”; that it “has kept America in a state of ignorance so far as religion is concerned, and has reduced its religious education to a condition far worse than that of the public secular schools.” He calls attention to “'the persisting absurdity of the uniform lessons, not only giving no religious education worthy of the name, but responsible for the indifivrcnce to religion and the church itself with which millions of young people quit the Sunday school”; and that “'as soon as they possibly can do it after eleven years of age, three out of every four leave the Sunday school and the church for the rest of their days.” As far as the finished product is concerned we get “the result that for fifty years American church members have grown up in complete ignorance of by far the larger part of the Bible, and of many of its best parts.” When it comes to the teachers, “our teachers are lazy and careless. Four-fifths of them arc young women of no training for the work of teaching.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Omaha Episcopalians have also condemned the Sunday school, declaring that it has outlived its usefulness, and urging that a plan be adopted by which the pupils in the public schools, with the written consent of the parents, be dismissed on designated days of the week, for an hour a day, and “under proper guidance” be taken to the church school of their parents’ choice, where they will be indoctrinated. Why take the school children apart to drill infidelity into them in another building ?</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark5"></a>IN RE CONVENTIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font15">O</span><span class="font7">NE of the precious things to the Christian is the joy of fellowship with others of like precious faith. The meeting together, the exchange of thoughts upon the Word of God, the singing of songs to his praise, the uniting of their petitions to the throne of heavenly grace, and the hearing some among them discourse on features of the divine plan, is really meat and drink for the new creature in Christ Jesus. The natural man requires food to sustain his physical body. Even so food for the now creature in Christ Jesus is equally necessary. The transformation of the new creature result' from the building up of the mind: and spiritual food provided by the Lord is necessary for this sustenance and renewing of the mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To enable on? another thu&lt; to develop and to encourage each &lt;&nbsp;th'<sup>1</sup>!' to remwed energy and zeal, and to increase their yiv in the Lord, conventions are held from time to time. As we come nearer to the end of the journey of the ch’ireh these ass -mblies seem to be more mem at-.. St. I Ar I fore-aw that ,-ueh would be the case, and he urged upon the brethren the nccessity of assembling themselves together. (Hebrews 10:25) It is not convenient, or in fact reasonably possible, to have a coment'on every year like unto that ot Cedar Point m 1922; but to make up for this smaller conventions are held in dmerent parts of the country, and the-.' lune always re-ulted in great blessing to the brethren v.bo attend for th? purpose of receiving a blessing ami being a blessing to other.-.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Ui. Paul. Minnesota, a conxeniion of the Bible Students was held May 4-6. The conwntion was addle -nd by Brother Boyd, Brother Stewart, and oth.rs. On Sunday morning Brother Rutherford was pres.u.t and adiTe- cd the convention. About five bundled friends all, ded, and all ; are t-'-lmimiy to the great strength and ble-smg derived fr, in the fellowhip in the biier p.r.od of time they attended the convention. It has always been difficult to get a large public attendance at St. Paul. The city is strongly Catholic, and has not heretofore been much inclined to attend our meetings provided for the public. On this occasion, however, the attendance was unusual. The brethren had taken a large aiuhtorium with a seating capacity of 4,000; and several minutes before the time for the lecture io begin the house was packed out, and the ushers estimated that between 2,000 and 3,000 people were turned away. More than 800 volumes of books were sold at this meeting. Brother Boyd addressed another public meeting in the same auditorium at night with a splendid attendance. The attention was unusually good. All the brethren wont away much encouraged in their efforts to advertise the King and the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A convention was held at Chicago May 11-13, This convention was addressed by Brothers Rico, Pollock, Horth, Nash, and other brothers of ability. Brother Rutherford served the convention Saturday evening. About 900 friends attended. On Sunday morning Brother Rutherford conducted a question meeting, following which there was a consecration of children. A great many children were on this occasion publicly presented by their parents to the Lord. It was an impressive and interesting service. At this service the speaker said in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is nothing dearer on earth than a child. The Lord shoved his great love for children, and it is reasonable that his followers would be likewise much interested in the little ones. A per-on who does not love a child seems to be quite out of the usual. There is something lacking in that person somewhere, particularly if he chums to be a Christian. If we love children generally, with stronger reasoning should we love the children of the consecrated. The apostle Paul speaks of their special relationship to the Lord because of the consecration of fheir parents. We should take a special iiiteiv'st in such children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The King is now present, and his kingdom is beginning. Many of the children now living will never die. What a v,ond&quot;i'tul prospect before them! And about till- tii,y should be inlormed. If properly instructed and Mailed on the right course they may readily pass over the highway of holiness. The responsibility of prnp rlv teaching' children cannot be overstated, 'the priw! ge of .-tartmg a child aright is a blessed one. “Train up a child in the way he should go; and . . . he will net depart from it.” (Proverbs 22:6) There never was such an important time to train children in the right way as now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some of the brethren from time to time have criti-eiz d their brethren for l-ringing children into the world, and from the. e words of criticism some have been much discouraged. We believe that this is not the proper course. While the chief purpose of each consecrated one is to glorify the Lord and to make his own calling and election sure, yet the bearing of children by the consecrated is not an improper thing. The apostle Paul commends the bearing of children by the consecrated. (1 Turn thy 5: 14) It should not be the chief purpose of the begotten ones to rear large families; but if, in pur.ming the natural course of the marital relationship, children are brought into the world, the parents should not be discouraged, but rather should rejoice. It means now the starting of a new life which may never go out. This is really a privilege, carrying with it of course a responsibility. If the child is properly trained from the beginning, it may early be of much use under the supervision of the princes of the earth in aiding others to be brought to a knowledge of the truth. Parents of the world look Ln ard to giving their children a reasonable competence, a good education, and therefore a fair start in the world. Parents who are Christians should now look fci&quot;.....d to giving their children a good education concernin&quot; the divine plan and therefore an advantageous start in the new order of things, that they ma be useful and that their course in life may be a glory to the King of kings and Lord of lords. Let not the parents of children at this time be discouraged, but rather feel keenly their privilege and responsibility concerning the children and start them on the right course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At once there is impressed upon the mind of a parent the responsibility of making provision for his children. The the Apostle states that the one who provides not for his own is worse than an unbeliever his statement is not limited to material provision, but also includes provision for the education and spiritual welfare of the child. One of the most important parts of this education is a knowledge of the divine plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The new creature in Christ is a child of God. All that he possesses belongs to the Lord by reason of his covenant. The child is a part of the parent. It therefore becomes the duty as well as the privilege of the parent to devote the child to the Lord. Of course this does not mean that the child can be taken into the church. It merely means that the parent in effect says to the Lord: You have given me this child. I now present it to you and ask that you grant unto it blessings according to your perfect wisdom, and to grant unto me wisdom and grace to properly train it insofar as I can, that it may be a glory to your name. The parent then feels a keener responsibility to see that the child is properly 1 rained and, particularly, properly taught concerning God’s great plan of salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is gratifying to see that the consecrated are giving more attention to their children in training them at home and providing for them class studies whereby they may understand the Bible. A great contrast between these and the children of the nominal church is noted. Some of the states have recently provided questionnaires for the school children, requiring them to give answers to Bible questions. This examination has disclosed the great ignorance of the children generally concerning the Bible and, in marked contrast, the clear understanding that many of the children of the consecrated have concerning God’s plan. This of itself is a witness to the truth and has induced parents who are not consecrated to inquire of brethren in the truth concerning the knowledge of their children on Bible matters; and thus some have been led to investigate the divine plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The parents should feel the responsibility now of training their children and teaching them concerning the kingdom. The young mind is open to learning these important things, and they will stay with it forever. Children should be taught that they were born imperfect because of sin; that God provided redemption through Christ Jesus; that Jesus long ago died to provide the ransom or redemptive price; that he rose from the dead; that his resurrection is a guarantee that all the dead in their graves shall come forth and have a trial for life; that for many centuries pad God has been selecting his church; that this work is almost complete; that the Lord Jesus promised to return for his church, the menders of his body; that he has returned; that he is now present and is setting up his kingdom; that soon the faithful men of old, from Abel to John the Baptist, will be resurrected and will be rulers in the earth; that it will be the privilege of the children to heed the teachings of these holy men, and without doubt they will have many positions for the children to occupy in the way of helping others on the highway of holiness, as well as passing themselves thereupon; and that these children will have a special advantage if they have been taught concerning God’s arrangement before the time of restoration really begins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those expecting to be of the church class do not expect to be long with their children in the flesh. Happy, then, is the thought that they can start the child aright here. The most reasonable thing, then, is to consecrate the child to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Society expects in a short time to have some lessons prepared for the children in simple language, particularly for those who are too young to study the Haupt or Volume I of Studies in the Sciuptukes. The intention is to have this small book of simple lessons furnished in connection with some hymns particularly adapted for the children, the purpose being to enable the parents at home, as well as the juvenile classes, to make progress in an understanding of the divine plan. Let us give more attention, then, to training the children; and doubtless through them other children will be brought to a knowledge of the truth and through them their parents, and the good work of advertising the King and the kingdom will progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For the public meeting at Chicago the brethren had taken the Auditorium, which is the largest in Chicago. The Chicago Class is to be commended for its zeal and love in the advertising for this public meeting, and the Lord greatly blessed their efforts. In addition to the newspaper advertisement, many house-to-house calls were made and cards presented to the people, besides advertising with a “preferred seat” ticket. The Lord greatly rewarded their faithful efforts. For some minutes before the beginning of the meeting, the Auditorium, with an approximate capacity of 4.500, including the stage, was packed out, with many hundreds in the street vainly striving to gain admittance. Two overflow meetings were provided. It was estimated that fully 6,500 people came to hear the lecture as a result of the advertising. Upwards of 2,000 volumes of books were sold to them. This public meeting was a great success in the proclamation of the message. The audience was unusually attentire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The convention concluded Sunday night with an address by Brother Horth; and from the lips of all the friends were heard expressions of thanksgiving to the Lord for his manifold blessings bestowed upon them during this gathering. Quite a number of visiting</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">brethren were present, and they together with the Chicago Class went to their homes happy, rejoicing in the manifestation of God’s lavor toward them. We are glad to note that the class in Chicago is in splendid spiritual condition, well organized for the Lord’s work, and going forth with a renewed determination to advertise the King and his kingdom and to glorify his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER CONVENTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the summer months other conventions will be held. There will be a convention at Toronto. Ontario, July 27-29; one at Winnipeg, Manitoba, August 3-5; at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, August 8-10; and at Edmonton, Alberta, August 10-12. 'These conventions will be attended by a number of the 1’ilgrim brethren; and it is anticipated that each \\ ill lie a time of gruit relresiling among't the Lord's child rem Special service days will be arranged for some of i'i'-e conventions, to be announced later, on which days the brethren will si'.end at lea t a part of the day cunv a'-sing for the books</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">AT TACOMA</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Unusual efforts are being put forth for a convention at Tacoma, Washington. This will be a six-day convention. beginning on August 1-1, and concluding Sunday night. August 19, with a great public meeting in the Stadium. This will be  </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font7"> convention of the Northwest; and the classes in that section of the coumry are uniting in a special effort to advertise particularly the Main meeting. It is expected that the Tacoma Convention will be served by the following speakers; Brothers Pickering, Herr, Van Amburgh, Wise. Salter, Graham, Horth, Rutherford, and others. One day will be given over to field service. It is expected that all the' classes in the Northwest v ill cooperate m this convention and we anticipate a time of great refreshment and blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">LOS ANGELES</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Arrangements are now practically completed for a nine-day convention of the International Bible Students at Los Angeles, California. 'The convention will begin August 18 and conclude August 26 with a public meeting in California’s new Stadium. This meeting will be widely advertised throughout all Southern California, and the intention is to give a large witness to the truth. All other sessions of the convention will be held in the Trinity Auditorium. It is expected that all the ecclesias of California will unite m making this convention the best that has ever been held in that part of the country. The speakers at this convention will include Brothers Van Amburgh, Salter, Wise, Howlett, Pollock, Horth, Sexton, Rutherford, and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There will be one day devoted to service, in which all of the visiting brethren will be invited to participate, in the same way that the service day was conducted at Cedar Point last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Friends desiring accommodations at these conventions of other information relating thereto should address the local committee. All communications relating to the Tacoma Convention should be addressed to C. F. W. Lundberg, P. 0. Box 1212, Tacoma, Washington; and for the Los Angeles Convention, E. D. Sexton, 200 Trinity Auditorium, Los Angeles. California.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">RAILROAD FARES</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The railroads have granted a fare for the Tacoma Convention for all points in Montana and west thereof on the certificate plan. Railroad ticket agents will furnish the passengers with a one-way ticket to Tacoma, giving them a regular form of receipt which will show the torn; and number of the ticket issued and the price of same. These receipts are presented to the validating agent at Tacoma. 'The return tickets are issued at one-half of the regular fare. The railroads have waived the minimum at lemlance requirement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For all points east of Monl.r a the rate vv ill be an-urmiL.ii. Iv one and one-tenth fare for the summer tourur 1.:ck&lt;L and will be cheaper than the convention rate. These tickets are good until October 31. Inquire of your local ticket agent for further information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SPECIAL TRAIN</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Learning of these conventions as above announced, I a number of friends have inquired concerning a special train from the East. The Society will not undertake to update a special train itself, but it a ,11 be pha-ed to cooperate with any friends who arrange for such a special train. Brother Frank T. Horth is arranging with flu' railways to operate a sp&quot;c.,:l train from Chicago. Professor Horth’s letter, which is inserted below, is self-explanatory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dhvii Biiothih Rltherfokd:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fei' rr; that tho friends might desire lo visit the six-day convent.on at Tacoma, Wash, August 11-19, and Ilie Los Allots. Calif., convention, August 18-2G, especially if a spe&lt;-i il train was arranged for, I took it upon mvself to look into the matter and find:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">1 . That the railroads have made a greatly reduced </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">rate </span><span class="font5">—alioul one and one-tenth fare for the round trip </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">-from </span><span class="font5">all points North. East, and South.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">2 By chartering standard Pullman sleepers, which could be u-ed as slot ping quarters during the entire journey of twenty-nine days without being overcrowded, and standard Pullman dining car service for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">tnit-ehny flute only,</span><span class="font5"> a charge of .$114.00 would be necessary. The railroad ticket would be an additional charge. Meals would not be served while in Tacoma or Los Angeles, but would be at all other stopovers.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">To determine the Lord's will in the matter will require three tilings:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(a) That you publish this notice in the Watch Tower; (&amp;) Unit at least 125 friends (the minimum full-fares allowed by the railroads for a special train) notify me before July 23 of their intention of going; and (c) send me $114.00 to cover cost of sleeping and dining car service, before August 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’1 he train would leave Chicago August 10, C., P&gt;. &amp;&nbsp;Q. R. It. at 3 p. m. and arrive in Tacoma on the morning </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">August 14, stops being mncle for meetings at Fargo, N. Dak., and Spokane, Wash. Leaving Tacoma about 10:30 p. m. August 19, after Ilie public meeting, a stopover of twelve hours will be made in Oakland, Calif., leaving there about 10:30 p. m., and arriving in Los Angeles the morning of August 22. Leaving Los Angeles August 31, a day will be allowed in Salt Lake City, through the Royal Gorge by daylight, and two days at the convention at Pueblo. A brief stop of a few hours will be made in Denver, and arriving in Chicago September 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I hope the point is clear that the $114.00 does not pay the railroad fare. Each one should purchase railroad ticket for the entire round trip from his home passenger ag&quot;'t. No doubt extra cars would be added at Tacoma and Oakland for Los Angeles. Friends of the Northwest would be picked up on the way to Tacoma.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Your co-laborer in the service, Frank T. Horth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since receiving the above letter Brother Horth writes as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford-</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Do not send money for your railroad ticket. This can be secured at the home station the day before the journey starts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">As this tour is for the purpose of advertising the King and the kingdom it would be fine if every class had a representative on the train. The representative chosen would lose the time and the class would pay the expenses. It would give each one an opportunity of having a share in furthering this movement for the interests of the King. Just a suggestion, however.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WORLD WITNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sunday, August 26. the date of the Los Angeles public discourse in the Stadium, is the day fixed for the next world-wide witness. Where it is not convenient for all the classes to have many meetings we sugge-t that they concentrate their force on one meeting, and then devote the rest of their energy to the canvassing for the books. Friends from all over the world wr te that it is a great stimulus to know that all the brethren are engaged on the same day in proclaiming the same message, their prayers and hands united together in the great cause of the King and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“With lowly hearts we come to thee, our God, Through Christ our Lord, who shed for us his blood, Earth’s sorrows now should bring thy saved ones near, Nearer to thee m conscious filial fear.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark7"></a>PRAYER-MEETING TEXT COMMENTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">TEXT FOR AUGUST 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The fruit of the spirit is . . . goodness and faith.” ^Galatians 3: 2‘.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE creature transformed by the holy spirit grows up into Christ Jesus. The outward growth of character is symbolized by ripe, perfect, luscious fruit. The Apostle says: “'The fruit of the spirit is love.” &quot;While stating this in the singular, he then adds other elements which go to make up the character likeness of our Lord, and which are a part of the outgrowth of one who is growing iu the likeness of tin* Lord. Among the other elements mentioned is goodness, which is defined as virtue, or beneficence; as the possession of moral excellence, kindness, benevolence, and mercy. Another has defined it as </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;love in action.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When one reaches the mark of perfect love he secs to it that his actions are in harmony with love. He is merciful unto his pen-editors, kind to the unthankful and to those who misunderstand, and benevolent toward all, having a sincere de.-ire to promote the welfare and happiness of all of the human race who desire righteousness. He specially desires to do good unto those of like precious faith. Thus in the likeness of the Lord, he is developing the quality of goodness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another element that forms a part of character is faith. Here the word as used means constancy in profession, or fidelity. It has been described by another as </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Tove upon the battlefield.”</span><span class="font7"> The true followers of Christ Jesus are now upon the battlefield and are engaged in the final conflict against the forces of evil before their change takes place. He, therefore, who is being transformed by the holy spirit is constant, loyal, and faithful to his brethren. He appreciates the fact that the enemy is striving to destroy his brother as well as himself; and with that fideldv peculiar to the Lord he looks out for the av elf are of his brother as a new creature in Christ. He counts it a joyful privilege to show his fidelity io his brethren in the conflict and thus prove his loyalty and faithfulness to the Lord, the Head of the new creation. This leads him to a fuller appreciation of the necessity of thinking and working together with others of like precious faith, dwelling in peace and unity, looking for that blessed day when the transformation will be complete and each member of the body will enjoy the unspeakable blessings of being forever with the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">TEXT FOR AUGUST 22</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The fruit of the spirit is .. . meekness, temperance.”—Galatians 5: 22, 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font7">ITHIN the meaning of the Scriptures meekness is that condition of mind which causes one to think of himself soberly, as he ought to think, and not be exalted in his own mind. Jesus said: “I am meek and lowly in heart.” (Matthew 11:29) To the new creature St. Paul says: “I say, ... to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.”—Homans 12:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To be exalted in one’s own mind is the fruit of the evil spirit. Lucifer being thus exalted became Satan, the devil. One of his strong weapons against the new creature is to induce in the mind of that one selfexaltation. He who is transformed into the likeness of his Master Christ Jesus fully realizes that all he is, has. or hopes to be is a gracious gift from the Lord. He rejoices to be submissive to the will of God. Whatsoever the Lord has provided for him, therewith he is content. Therefore meekness may be properly defined as </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">'Tove in resignation.”</span><span class="font7"> The new creature is led to this condition of mind by his love for the Lord and by developing the likeness of the Lord Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Temperance</span><span class="font7"> means self-control or moderation. The spirit of the Lord operating upon the mind of the new creature, and the new creature cooperating therewith, develops in him the disposition of self-control. He learns to be moderate in all things. His trust is in the Lord and hone;' ho is not taken off his foot by the happening of unusual events. When persecuted, he remembers that the Lord has permitted it for some good purpose. Hence he refuses to yield to excessive sorrow or grief. If exalted, he remembers that all true promotion comes from the Lord; hence he calmly and serenely rests in the Lord’s love and is not swerved from a right course by the flattery of men. He appreciates that whatsoever he receives of good is from the Lord, and shows this appreciation by inward joy and thankfulness of heart and fidelity in action, and not by hilarious outward demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The ripe, complete fruit of the spirit is love, made up of the elements of joy, peace, long-suffering, goodness, faith, meekness and temperance. These combined and ripened into perfect love constitute, the fruits of the spirit. Love is the perfect expression of the Lord’s likeness. Therefore love is the greatest of all things.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Be renewed in the spirit of your mind.”—Ephesians 4: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE proper tendency of the spirit or disposition of the mind of the new creature is toward Christ Jesus, that the creature may be  made into his likeness. To be renewed in the spirit or disposition of the mind means to be renovated, reformed and up-builded. There is but one way for thus renewing the mind, and that is by feeding the mind upon the things which the Lord has provided. It means to think on those things which pertain to the Lord and his gracious provision for mankind. This means that such a one must study the Word of God and the helps divinely provided. Thinking and meditating upon the things pertaining to the Lord’s kingdom will lead one to put forth his hands to do whatsoever he finds to do to further the interests of that kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Christian developing character must reach the point of fortitude. We have come to that time when we must no longer be tossed about by every wind of doctrine that may be advanced, but stand firm in the Lord and in the things that he has taught us. Having once been brought to a knowledge of the truth, we should appreciate God’s provision for us. To become indifferent to this provision and to push it aside would mean the spirit of disloyalty to the truth which the Lord has provided for the mind to feed upon. It is impossible for such a one continuing in this course to remain in the truth, but he will be quickly taken into darkness. God graciously draws men to Christ Jesus, and hence to the truth; but by indifference, lack of appreciation, or disloyalty the creature draws himself away from the truth and from the Lord. There is but one safe course for the Christian; and that is, to constantly feed his mind upon the precious things which the Lord has provided at his table, and to keep his hands busy in things pertaining to the King’s business and to do that with haste. Proper thinking, which renovates or renews the spirit of the mind, will lead to groper action, in harmony with the Lord’s will.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">STEPHEN'S MARTYRDOM.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ll'/io </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?”—Romans 8:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">S</span><span class="font5">TEPHEN has the honor of being the first Christian martyr, the first to follow his Master unto death. Like his Master he was slain as a blasphemer of God. Excepting the apostles, Stephen was the most prominent man in those earliest days of the church. All the references to him show that he was a Hellenist, a Jew of the dispersion We do not know how long he had resided in Jerusalem when he saw the truth concerning Jesus and accepted it. Probably lie had gone up at a feast time and had hoard the apostles, and had become convinced of the truths they taught. He was a man of ability, of much force of character, a good man seeking the honor of the God of Israel. It was his filial fear of God winch enabled him to receive the truth. Indeed, when the Word of God was heard, any honest man in Israel must have been convinced; only prejudice could prevent the truth from entering the heart. If the heart be honest a message from God will enter as readily as light or air will enter a room even if there be only a crevice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup>Stephen was first brought into prominence in the church when its arrangements for the distribution of alms were proving unsatisfactory. The early church had its ideals. Tlie brethren, forced into union by untoward circumstances, as well as drawn together by love, desired to help each other in every possible way. They realized their separation from all others; they were a people apart. They did not know how long a time would elapse before the Lord would return and bring affairs in Israel (and all the earth) under his control; but they thought the time of waiting would be short, and that very probably they would do well if while waiting they lived together as much as possible. How the movement started we do not know; but it came about that those who had lands and property sold out, and placed the money to a common fund which was used for the support of the poorer members of the church. Murmur-ings and dispulings arose, as they always have done when materials tilings are in question. Those who were Grecians complained that in the daily ministration their widows wore neglected in favor of the Hebrews or Jerusalem Jews. The apostles, realizing that their special work was increasing, saw that if they were to give personal attention to this matter, their time would be taken up in “serving tables” ; and that they would be hindered in the proclamation of the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">STEPHEN DECLARES TRUTH IN SYNAGOGUE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup>The church was assembled and told that they should look out seven men of good report, full of the holy spirit and wisdom, and that the apostles would appoint them over this business. Seven men were chosen by the church; and Stephen, “a man full of faith and of the holy spirit,&quot; was the first mentioned. The apostles then laid hands on the seven. Krom this time the word of God Increased, the number of disciples in Jerusalem multiplied greatly, and a great company of the priests became obedient to the faith. (Acts 6:7) Stephen at once came into prominence, not because he was a great mlnlstrator, but because he was “full of faith and power, and did great wonders and miracles among the people.&quot;—Acts 6: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>i</sup>At that time there was in Jerusalem a synagogue specially used by the Jews of the dispersion, the place where Stephen had been accustomed to worship. His notable service for his Master, and his declaration that Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah, brought him into conflict with the leaders of the synagogue. Probably Saul </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">Tarsus </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font5">amongst those who worshiped there. These disputed with Stephen, but “were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.” (Acts 6:10) Being unable to refute his arguments, they showed their wickedness of heart, and that they were exactly of the same spirit as those who a little while before had brought false witnesses against Jesus. They suborned men to state untruths, to bear false witness against Stephen. His words were </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">per</span><span class="font5">verted, were made to convey statements apart from their meaning. It seems as if the leaders of ecclesiasticism when assailed with truth very easily lend themselves to Satan. Hypocrisy in professed servants of God gives Satan </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">master-key to every chamber of the heart. Such </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">become </span><span class="font5">his ready dupes and agents; and such have ever been numbered amongst the world’s evil men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup>The Sanhedrin was moved to take action against Stephen, and apparently was very ready to do so; for the sect of Jesus of Nazareth was Increasing, and the rulers’ position was threatened. The council was set, and Stephen was brought before it. The witnesses came and laid charge. They said: “This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law.” (Acts 6:13) The eyes of all In the council </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font5">drawn </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">Stephen </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">hold ; for they saw his face as if it had been the face of an angel (v. 15)—a wondrous contrast from theirs. His was radiant with the love of God, the privilege of serving his Master; theirs were malignant with venom because their hearts were evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>c</sup>Tlie charges made against Stephen were: (1) “This Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and (2) shall change the customs [or rites] which Moses delivered us.” (Acts 6:14) The indictment presumes that the temple worship was a permanent part of the plan of God for Israel, and also that the laws and ceremonies of Moses were established forever. The high priest asked Stephen: “Are these things so?” The question could not be answered by either Yes or No; for the indictment was based </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">upon </span><span class="font5">truth perverted. Stephen entered into an explanation </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font5">intended strictly </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font5">a defense; but, while defending </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">him</span><span class="font5">self, he set forth the purpose of God, whom they professed to serve. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font5">gave </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">review of God’s purposes as </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">revealed </span><span class="font5">in the history of Israel. This was wise; for only in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">this </span><span class="font5">way can one get lifted to the place of understanding, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">even </span><span class="font5">as no one gets present truth save by a knowledge of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">divine plan. He desired to show these men that God </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font5">consistently working out a plan of which both the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Mosaic </span><span class="font5">law and the temple service were merely features which, when they had fulfilled their purpose, must be put </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">away </span><span class="font5">even as a garment that has served its purpose. He reminded them of their father Abraham’s call out of Mesopotamia, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">he was </span><span class="font5">brought “into this land </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">wherein ye now </span><span class="font5">dwell”; but was given </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font5">inheritance in it, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not so much as </span><span class="font5">to set his foot on. The covenant God made with </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Abraham </span><span class="font5">was one of promise to be entered into fully on a future date. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font5">had said that Abraham’s seed should dwell in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">strange land and be evilly treated four hundred years; and that he would deliver them and bring into judgment the nation which held them In bondage; that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">his seed should </span><span class="font5">then serve God in the land of promise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">^Reviewing these facts, Stephen told of the bondage in Egypt and of the hard affliction which there came upon Israel under the cruel Pharaoh. Thon in a swift review he told of the birth of Moses and of his up bringing in special circumstances under the providence of God, and showed that Moses, learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and mighty in word and deed, when he was forty years old understood that God had raised him up to deliver his people But Isriel was dull in understanding, and did not accept the deliverance which Moses believed he could have brought them (Acts 7 : 25) The promised deliverer was rejected ; instead of Laing ready they said: “Who made thee a ruler ami a judge over us?” Thus Moses the deliverer went aw,15, and was forty years a stranger in the land of Minium Innim: Unit time the affliction of Israel by Pharaoh so im/eased in severity that at last the people cried out by rem mi of the hard-daps they were forced to bear. Their cry reached heaven; and the time of their deliverance being fully, come, Cod appeared to Moses in the burning bush in lio. t b Moses was now sent to his people, he whom previously they had rejected. (V. 35) He brought them out of Egypt, and by him God delivered his people from their hard bondage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">REHEARSAL OF GOO’S PROVIDENCES ANGERS LEADERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>s</sup>The point Stephen was driving home was that the deliverer, whom every Israelite honored as the maker of their nation, was first of all refused by them. Now he goes on to declare how this same Moses said that he in reality teas only a type of One greater who should bring real delher-ance. and who should enter the children of Abraham fully into the covenant of promise. Then he told how Moms received the law covenant at Sinai, and how there Israel rejecting him turned back in their hearts to Egypt from whence they had been delivered. (AL 39) They fell away from the worship of Jehovah to worship the hosts of heaven and graven images. Then he remimhd them that though Solomon built a temple for God he himself Pad said that he dwelt not in such temples made with hands: “Heaven is my throne, and earth is my loo'.stcol: what house tv ill ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest? Hath not my ham's made all these things?” (Acts 7:49,50) The temple, \ uh all the system </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">worship it represented, must pas: awry. As the points </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">the argument were perceived, the faces of the Sani.edrin set hard. They saw that even by their own scripture.-, this follower of Jesus of Nazareth was destroying every argument they had; and they did not want to know God’s will nor the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Stephen apparently saw a change coming over the faces </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">the leaders; and without further continuing his argument, and feeling the impossibility of changing their minds, or of helping them into the way of truth, he broke out upon them. (A's. 51-53) He was calm, and with the peace of God in his heart; they, elderly men as they were, gnashed upon him with their teeth. lie, lull of the holy spirit, turned his face lit with the glory of the Lord, to heaven. He declared that he saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on his right hand. They stopped their ears and, running upon him, hurried him out of the city. They </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">led </span><span class="font5">him out towards where Geihsctimne lay in the valley, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font5">just outside the city walls they stoned him. Calling to his Lord, he said: “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit I” and kneeling as in an attitude of worship, he cried in a loud voice: “Lord, lay not this sin to their charge, and . . . . fell asleep.” (Acts 7:60) AVhat a contrast is revealed! His persecutors and murderers were a yelling, screaming mob; but he falling asleep with the light of glory and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">peace </span><span class="font5">on his face. Thus </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">died the first martyr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PERSECUTION SCATTERS BELIEVERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup>Stephen’s death brought a climax. The leaders </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of Israel, </span><span class="font5">their passions aroused, began a great persecution ; and the church in Jerusalem, with the exception of the apostles, was scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“This wicked act and its immediate consequences served neither their purpose nor that of Satan its instigator; for the word of the Lord increased, and the seed of the gospel truth was spread far and wide. (Acts 8:1) Saul of Tarsus was amongst those who were at the stoning, and assisted by minding the clothes of the false witnesses, who, as the law demanded, cast the first stones at the one they accused. Saul, inflamed with passion, made himself a leader amongst the persecutors; and being exceedingly mad against the followers of Jesus, he got permission to go even as far as Damascus in the endeavor to eradicate this heresy. Then the Lord took a hand in the work and, as he often does, turned the works of Satan into his own service</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Only to read of Stephen's fidelity is sut’iciem to inlhinw the heart of every loyal servant of God. while a more careful study strengthens the roots of faith, and the purposes of the consecrated heart to use every opportunity of service while the privilege remains. Stephen’s short but brilliant life in the church reveals the fact that fidelity to God does not always mean long-continued service. The Master knows how to use his instruments. It seems a safe thing to say that Stephen's service for the church, wrought in times of faith and spirit, and m so short a time, has done more for the church of Cod as a whole than any long-continued service could have done for the church of </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ils</span><span class="font5"> day. The light of his life of faith and love in the fulness of the holy spirit shines brightly even to our day. He served ail 11 stead of a few. Thus Stephen was in his manner of service and death more like his Master than any of the o her saints of the Now Testament. He died for the faith, and His death brought many into the truth. He gave all his heart to God, withholding nothing, and God honored him, even as 1 e says: ■■Them that honor me I will honor.” (1 Samuel 2: 3,1) Stephen was the first of the early church to die faithful unto death to receive the Crown of Life. It is surely significant that Stcpla.i's name means &quot;a crown.”</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark242"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark243"></a>BARNABAS THE GREAT-HEARTED</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">---August</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 26--</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Book of Acts---</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BARNABAS LABORS TO GOD’S GLORY--BARNABAS A COMPANION TO PAUL—GENEROUS AND LOVING DISPOSITION OF BARNABAS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“he was a good man, and full of the holy spirit and of faith.&quot;—Acts 11: 2/<sub>f</sub>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">B</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ARNABAS, who was a Levite of the island of Cyprus, </span><span class="font5">was one of the best known men of the early church. Our lesson names him the Great-hearted, and correctly so: for his record is that of a large-hearted, generous man. His real name was Joseph; Barnabas, or son of consolation, was the name given to him by the apostles because he was a comforter and exporter of the brethren. He was one of the lirst of those who, having lands or houses, sold them in order that the poorer members of the newly-formed community might be helped. He was the brother of Mary the mother of Mark, and it is possible that he made her house in Jerusalem Ills home. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Of </span><span class="font5">large build of body and of a generous lieart, he was a man who would attract attention, and would be one to whom the brethren could go for guidance, and from whom they could expect help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>J</sup>lt is easy to sei' that such a man as Barnabas must have been of considerable force in the church. Naturally lie would be one of those who would attend Io any business matters which might arise, and would lie on familiar terms with the apostles. Probably he associated with them in fellowship as on equal terms, except that he would always acknowledge their position in the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■’■When Paul escaped Ironi Damascus and returned to Jerusalem, it was rather as a fugitive than otherwise. When there and endeavoring to obtain fellowship witli the brethien, both they and the apostles were afraid of him. They could not think that this man, who had been so mad against them, was now in heart one with them in the faith of Jesus. Barnabas had the faculty of discerning truth and character. He saw that Paul was genuine and needed help, and it was his generous heart and hand -which gave Paul welcome. Barn..has vias just the one to take Paul in hand. He became his advocate, and took him in to tho apostles, and as his spokesman told them of Paul’s experiences, thus showing them that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">he</span><span class="font5"> accepted all Paul's statements. Barnabas would have no fear of Paul; and being somewhat of a masterful disposition lie would be exactly the one to take that awkward and ditlieult situation in hand. Paul would ever be grateful for that timely and welcome service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup>After the persecution which arose out of the death of Stephen the church in Antioch grew quickly. A great number believed and turned to the Lord; lor, though a very wick' 1 city, Antioch had in it a great many people whose heart , were disposed towards the truth. Owing partly to i ; geographical situation, and because it vvas a city of commerce, the Jews who resided there had a better oppor-ti: lily of seeing more of the Gentile world than was pos-s,bie to the Jews of Jerusalem. They would see the things to admire as well as to shun. Because they were less trammeled by the traditions of the priestly class, they exercised more liberty of thought, and were more ready to listen to the things preached by the disciples than were the Judeans. The apostles heard of the good work which was going on in Antioch, and they sent Barnabas from Jerusalem to exhort the brethren and lead them on. They were surely guided by the spirit of God ; for had they sent a brother witli a less generous heart, or witli a narrow outlook, the church in Antioeh could not have been so well served. Barnabas was exactly suitable both by reason of birth and education; also, because he was a good man with a gift of exhortation and, like Stephen, was full of the holy spirit </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">faith. (Acts </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11:24) Not so </span><span class="font5">brilliant as Stephen, he </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">was one of </span><span class="font5">tiiose men </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">who are </span><span class="font5">always useful in the church </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">cf God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">BARNABAS LABORS TO GOD’S GLORY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup>As a </span><span class="font5">result of Barnabas’ labors many people </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">were added </span><span class="font5">to the church. But Barnabas realized that a greater and deeper work than he was capable of doing was necessary for the development of the church. He perceived that a teacher was necessary If the Lord’s cause was to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font5">served to its best interests; and he thought of Paul who he knew was capable of teaching, a service greater and more lasting than exhortation. All this time Paul was in Cilicia in Asia Minor. Barnabas went there seeking him and, finding him. persuaded him to return to Antioeh. There they labored together; and God blessed their labors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup>In the church In Antioeh there was a fine company of earnest men whom the Lord had richly blessed. During the time they labored there Paul, remembering his Master’s words and the commission he had received, would be wondering about his life's work (Acts 0:15; 22:15; 1 Corinthians 9: 17) ; and as he was a man of prayer he would wait on tho Lord, seeking guidance. And, naturally enough, Barnabas would think of Cyprus, and Lucius of Cyrene would think of his home. The holy spirit moved these men, and they all prayed together about the work of the Lord. In some way, not noted in the Scriptures, the holy spirit said: “Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work wliereunto I have called them.” (Acts 13: 2) Without delay, and sent as by the church, they left Antioch for Cyprus, Barnabas’ home. They took with them John Mark to minister to them; that is, to arrange for lodgings and the various things necessary to the service. Barnabas would be very much pleased to have his nephew go with them, and surely the young man would consider the service an honor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’After they had labored for a time in Cyprus, they had an encounter with a spirit medium who withstood them. Paul, filled with the holy spirit, sentenced him to blindness for a season. From that time Paul took the lead in the work; and the incident revealed tliat it was lie rather than Bar,-abas who had the responsibility of proclaiming the gospel. (Acts 13:8-11) Hitherto the order had been Barnabas and Saul: henceforth it was Paul and Barnabas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">'•When they arrived on the mainland and were </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">about to </span><span class="font5">leave for the inland cities. Mark- declined to go with them, and returned home. We do no, know v.hat caused him to return to Jerusalem. Perhaps he had an objection to the apostle Paul's taking the lead instead of his uncle Barnabas; or perhaps it was that in part, and in part fear of the difficulties of the journey. The two men went forward, and tlielr record of labor is good to read. In the various places they met with much persecution, but in each place visited they left a little company rejoicing in the Lord. At Lystra, the inhabitants tit first thought that the gods had come down to them because of a notable miracle which </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Paul </span><span class="font5">wrought. Paul, the smaller of the Iwo, they named Mercury because be was the chief messenger; Barnabas, the larger, they named Jupiter. But h aiming ot their mission through the opposition of certain Jews, the people turned bitteriy against them; and Paul was stoned, dragged out of the city, and left for dead. He was raised up as by a miracle. Barnabas escaped this trouble; no reason why is stated. After a time they retraced their steps, going over the same ground confirming the churches; and on their return </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">Antioeh they were able to give </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a good account to the </span><span class="font5">bredircn who had sent them </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">out </span><span class="font5">as </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">apostles.—Acts 14; 21-28,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>B</sup>Barnabas is next heard of when witli Paul be withstood those who had come down from Jerusalem to Antioch to try to reestablish circumcision as a necessary adjunct to faith. These were the Judaizers who, professing to be members of the church of Christ, were the agents of the devil, seeking to bring in false doctrines. On account of these things, and because these men were active everywhere, the church held a council in Jerusalem. Barnabas and Paul were delegates to the conference, and they told of what God had done through them on their missionary journey. Barnabas spoke first. Evidently the apostles were still somewhat reticent towards Paul, though after the conference ended both men are spoken of in very loving words. “It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you, with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.”—Acts 15:25,26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup>After some days Paul suggested that they should again </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">go </span><span class="font5">over the ground of their first journey to visit the churches. Barnabas was ready, but desired that his nephew Mark should go with them. Paul would not agree to this. He had a strong opinion about Mark's deflection ; and so sharp grew the contention between them that these two notable ami great men severed their special bond of fellowship. Paul would not trust Mark; for Mark had proved something like a broken reed. (Isaiah 311: 6) Barnabas, with perhaps a clearer perception and a better understanding of his n&lt; phew, wanted to help him to make good. To Paul the work was too urgent to try experiments, and he took Silas with him. Barnabas took Mark, and they went to Cjprus; but that is the last we hear of their work or of Barnabas. PerImps it is safe to conclude from the silence </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">Scripture time Barnabas made a mistake in taking his </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">way. </span><span class="font5">With his perception of character and good judgment, he ought to have perceived that even if in his opinion his judgment were as good as Paul’s, yet Paul had a greater office in the sight of the Lord. Barnabas should have accepted Paul’s decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">GENEROUS AND LOVING DISPOSITION OF BARNABAS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup>Thc early church owes much to the large-hearted, generous disposition of Barnabas. His heartiness and his warmth must have helped and cheered very many in those hard days. As for Paul, we know he would have developed into the great Apostle in any case; for God had called him to a work. But God uses human means; and, speaking from this point of view, it was Barnabas who helped Paul into his ministry. A self-sacrificing man, he was, like Paul, willing to work at a trade in order to support himself, although he might have lived at comparative ease. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He sold </span><span class="font5">his lands for the benefit of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup>Mark also had much to thank his uncle for. The discernment of good in Mark, and the possibilities of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font5">making good after his deflection seemed clear to Barnabas; and God blessed his efforts to help his nephew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1 :</sup>The ability of Barnabas to serve lay chiefly in those qualities which made him so well-beloved. His charitable disposition, whether in respect of his money or his service or his heart, and his ready speech made him specially serviceable to the Lord. His defects naturally arose out of his qualities. His leaning towards Mark caused him to miss the great service to Paul and, with him, to the churches. The saints, while saying, “When I am weak I am strong,” need always to consider the reverse—and very many of their mistakes arise from a neglect to consider it. They may say: ‘In whatever things I am strong, there I am liable to weakness.' Barnabas evidently over-balanced himself in leaning to Mark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“The point calls for emphasis. To Barnabas the restora</span><span class="font5">tion of Mark seemed a necessity, whereas to Paul the wwk of the Lord was the foremost consideration. The question was, Is the restoration of a person as important as the Lord’s work? Barnabas seems to have thought it was. or that the work could be done while carrying the responsibility of helping Mark. Paul thought otherwise. In the experiences of the classes there come times wiien a consideration of faulty brethren, however dear, must take second place to the needs of the Lord’s work. It seems proper to consider that the Lord has in tins ease provided the necessary example for the church's instruction. Barnabas needed not to fall into a misjudgment. He knew that Paul was specially called of the Lord (Acts I): 15) ; so that if his opinion did not coincide with Paul's, lie ought to have submitted to Paul. He ought not to have considered his judgment as being so good in the Lord’s sight as Paul’s. Standing for what one conceives to be right is not always the better course. Indeed, it has led many a brilliant servant into wrong ways; and many a useful brother has lost his course through an assertion of his right to judge as against what ought to be God's plain providences or arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Probably many of the Lord's people have been led astray, al least for a time, by holding out some sympathy towards misguided or mistaken brethren. Perhaps sympathy is one of the most difficult of the things of life to use rightly. On that occasion Paul was like a rock; and by the grace of the Lord his action saved the church. Barnabas overcame the default, but he had known so much that Paul seems to express surprise at his failure to perceive the truth on that matter. (Galatians 2:13) The salety of the Lord's people lies in their constant watchfulness in prayer, in full submission to the will of God as expressed in his providences, and in earnest service seeking the interests </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">the kingdom of heaven. Barnabas, the son of consolation, left for the church a sweet fragrance of loving service, ami an example of watchfulness over the needs of others, which all the Lord’s people may copy to their advantage.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font4">Some months ago we learned</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">that on the west coast of Africa,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">in P'O I’riL.h possession known as Sierra Leone, there are many the I.cent people who have never heard the kingdom message. Brother W. R. Brown, of Jamaica, was willing to go. He has opened a new office of the Society at Freetown, Sierra Leone. Oar readers will be pleased to know that the message of the kingdom is being given to the people in West Africa:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">My Dear Brother Rutherford :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We arrived in Sierra Leone on the fourteenth of April, ten days* sail from Liverpool. We found Brother Joseph the next day. Freetown is quite a large town. The natives here are intelligent and wide awake to conditions, especially’ religious. Lots of churches hoto. The majority of ministers are black men. Many schools are here, high schools among them. Besides, many of the boys here had their schooling in England. The field is a good one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I started canvassing on the eighteenth of April. Today, The second of May, I have one set left. I had to cable to the London office for fifty sets more. the booklets are going rapidly. We are driving the Heralds now until shipment of books arrives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I delivered four lectures In April. The hall was packed each night. The hall has a seating capacity of 500, the largest in the town. I will be delivering two lectures every week in that hall. Caretaker’s fee and lights cost nine shillings a night. The people are calling me to other parts of the colony to give lectures. The lot lecture we gave on ‘'Millions Now Living Will Never Die” we sold in the hall eighty booklets.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">The “Talking with the Dead”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">booklets are going rapidly ; also “Hell.&quot; Many call in to see us dailv and to uet the books. How thankful we are for the privilege!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We learn from the people here that the people in Liberia and Nigeria would buy the books. Colporteurs would do well down there. The British government is building a harbor in Nigeria and quite a lot of workmen are employed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the lectures here sometimes eight ministers attend. Some wish me well and inform me I have a large field before me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We had to stay in a hotel for six days before we could get a bouse. Rent for houses is very dear here in Freetown. We have an upper apartment, three rooms, a hail and a dining room, for £4:10:0 a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The import duty here is twenty-five percent, so foodstuffs and other things are pretty high, especially in the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are still inquiring for a cheaper house and a place where we can exhibit the books. The heat is great here. We cannot rush it as we would like during the days. We found three other interested friends. One is a teacher at the model school. I am sending financial report by next mail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Could you send me fifty copies of The Golden Age? We believe we will get a good many subscribers. Also five copies of The Watch Tower every two weeks. We are getting a good many Watch Tower subscribers, too. The proclamation tracts are going out. They are opening the eyes of many. We are keeping well and busy. Sister Brown joins me in sending much lo\ e.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yours in the Redeemer, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W. R. Brown.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
