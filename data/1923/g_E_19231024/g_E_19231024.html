<h3><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>A Lesson in Volcanology</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE most popular theory regarding volcanoes is that they are gigantic boilers. Into some cave far beneath the earth’s surface a quantity of water finds its way. The cave may have a roof miles in thickness, but its floor is the molten interior of the earth. Steam is generated. The aperture through which the water entered becomes sealed by molten rock pouring into it, by a slight earthquake, or otherwise. The steam gets hotter and hotter. The potential energy of superheated steam confined in the cave at length becomes great enough to force an opening, either the old one or a new one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the opening takes place, no one can tell what will issue from the caldron. Steam there may be, a little; but a boiling geyser of molten rock, inconceivably hot, may reveal itself. What issues forth may be so volatile, so superheated, as to turn into dust the moment it comes into contact with the air. The result of a single volcanic eruption may be to change the climate of the whole earth for two years following.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a connection of some sort between volcanic activity and rainfall, and the connection seems to work both ways. In a volcanic region a heavy rainfall may cause a quiescent volcano to resume operations; and when the operations are resumed, they may be the cause of unusual quantities of rain over a large area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It occurs to us, from the evidence at hand, that a few active volcanoes scattered here and there over the earth’s surface, accomplish a good work. They eject quantities of infinitely fine dust into the upper air, and these dust particles become nuclei for raindrops. Quite possibly the renewals of volcanic activity noted within the past two years are a definite part of God’s plan for causing such changes in earth’s climate as will make for a more general watering of the dry places. The latest efforts of scientists for causing rain in dry places have been along the line of ejecting fine dust into the air from airplanes. It would be interesting if it transpires that the Lord is going to do all that is necessary along this line, using volcanoes to do the work.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Vesuvius and Pisanello</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">W</span><span class="font5">HEN the subject of volcanoes is mentioned the mind instinctively turns to Vesuvius, the world’s best-known volcano, situated in one of the garden spots of the globe, and in a place easy of access. Near the great city of Naples, Italy, an electric railway runs to within 250 yards of the crater, and tourists take the adventurous risk of going not only to the summit but even to a considerable depth within the crater.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Vesuvius has a basal circumference of thirty miles. Its height is 3,800 feet. There is no record that it was active until 63 A. D.&gt; when many surrounding cities were damaged by an earthquake, and subterranean caves were probably created which have been responsible for its frequently recurring activities ever since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The greatest recorded eruption of Vesuvius was in 79 A. D., when the cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii were buried in volcanic ash. The decorations on the walls of Pompeiian houses which have been unearthed reveal a shameless licentiousness and debauchery among its inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Near the edge of the Vesuvian crater the Italian government maintains an observatory established for the express purpose of watching volcanic phenomena. The observatory is connected with Naples by telephone. In a time of eruption, some years ago, when the people about the base of the mountain were alarmed for their safety and for the safety of their homes, they were calmed by the reassuring messages which came to them from the edge of the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">flaming </span><span class="font5">abyss. The volcanologist encouraged the people with reasons to believe that the eruption would do no great damage, and reminded them that volcanic ash is one of the best of plant foods. At the time he sent these messages the observatory was completely hidden from view in smoke and fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Vesuvius was active in 1921, note was taken of the fact that the Spring of the year, especially the month of April, seems to be the favorite time for the beginning of operations. Professor Maladra, the present volcanologist at Vesuvius, attributes the outbreak in the Spring of 1923 to the heavy rains which fell in February of this year. It was a considerable time after the rains before the outbreak occurred. During the interval we may suppose that the volcano was literally getting up steam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While much of the western coast of Italy gives evidence of volcanic origin, Vesuvius, until 1920, was the only active volcano on the continent of Europe; but in October of that year Mount Pisanello, in the Apuan Alps, near Carrara, also became active.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Etna and Stromboli</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">M</span><span class="font5">OUNT ETNA, on the island of Sicily, is much larger than Vesuvius and more destructive. Its height is about 10,875 feet. A railway seventy miles in length ascends in spiral form to the summit. Sections of the railway frequently require to be rebuilt</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since the year 476 B. C. eighty eruptions have been recorded. In that of 1169 A. D. 15,000 persons lost their lives; and in that of 1693 A. D. 60,000 persons perished. In the eruption of 1879 molten lava poured from 100 different mouths. Greek mythology mentions Etna repeatedly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The length of the eruptions varies greatly. That in 1614 lasted ten years, that in 1911 only ten days, while the eruption in 1908 lasted only eight hours. Professor Ottorino Fiore, volcanologist at Etna, predicted that the eruption this year would last two weeks; and his prediction seems to have come true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The whole slope of Mount Etna is intensively cultivated. Hence every eruption, while it brings more volcanic ash to enrich the soil, also brings destraction in its wake. The one in June of this year destroyed four villages, and made 30,000 people homeless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is pathetic and exasperating to read </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font5">when the lava stream from Etna was approaching the town of Linguaglossa the parish priest had the inhabitants kneeling bareheaded in front of a statue </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">&quot;Saint ^Egidius,” offering the saint flowers and lighted candles if he would stop the flow of lava. Natives of an adjoining town halted a procession which was carrying a staff of this particular saint, so that they could stop the lava from reaching their own town; and the police had to separate the' combatants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The volcanologists had agreed that the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">lava </span><span class="font5">flow would stop short of Linguaglossa, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font5">did. But the saint got the credit of stopping </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">it. </span><span class="font5">If the staff and the statue of our friend JEgidius are so effective as lava stoppers, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">why </span><span class="font5">not take him up in an airplane and shove him </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">off </span><span class="font5">into Etna itself, and thus stop the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">lava </span><span class="font5">before it gets started 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The flow of lava in 1923 was slow, but </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font5">thirty feet deep, and in places was said to have run up-hilL It was so intensely hot that trees and vegetation burst into flame ninety feet away from the stream. The explosions as the lava reached bodies of water could be heard seventy miles away. Instruments registered 940° temperature. The damage was estimated at one hundred million lives, about $24,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Unlike the volcanoes that experience intense paroxysms of activity followed by long </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">periods </span><span class="font5">of repose, the volcano of Stromboli, in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">Mediterranean Sea north of Sicily, offers </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font5">example of continuous activity. Standing </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">alone </span><span class="font5">in the sea, it is visible at night for a hundred miles, its ever-lighted fires tinting the clouds and sky with a rosy glow which has led to its being known as &quot;The Lighthouse of the Mediterranean?’ The lower portions of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">moun</span><span class="font5">tain are fertile and inhabited.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Popocatapetl and Villarica</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">P</span><span class="font5">OPOCATAPETL in the Aztec </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">language </span><span class="font5">means &quot;smoking mountain.” Its height is 17,783 feet, which is considerably more </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">than </span><span class="font5">that of Mont Blanc; and it was long reckoned the highest mountain in North America. It </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font5">since yielded the palm to Mount McKinley, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">Alaska, however.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Within the throat of the crater, which is over two miles in circumference, it is estimated that there are 148,000,000 tons of sulphur, the supply of which increases at the rate of one percent annually. In 1904 a New York capitalist purchased the mountain from its Mexican owner </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font5">a half-million dollars. From time imme-morial the natives have ascended the mountain </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">obtain sulphur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is nearly six hundred years since Popocatepetl has been on the warpath, although there was a mild eruption in 1802, and there were perceptible vapors above the crater in 1909. For the last three years it has been slowly waking up. In January, 1920, great fissures appeared around the crater, and poisonous vapors arose. In December, 1920, four daring Americans ascended, although the mountain then was in mild eruption. They found that the small lake which formerly filled the center of the crater had disappeared. A year later the volcano was throwing up smoke, fire, and stones that could be seen a hundred miles, accompanied by noises that were as unpleasant as those made by a jazz band. On the sides of the mountain it used to be a favorite sport to sit upon </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">goatskin and slide 5,000 feet to the base of the snow-line; but in January, 1922, all the snow went off for the first time within memory, disappearing in roaring torrents poured down the arroyas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">About the time Popocatapetl began to awaken, San Miguel, a small supposedly extinct volcano, burst in twain, belching forth ashes, dust and streams of hot water mixed with sulphur gases, killing 200 Mexicans and utterly wasting one of the most fertile valleys in Mexico. The river </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">the valley disappeared, leaving the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">land </span><span class="font5">without water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In May, 1921, after a series of earthquakes in which fifteen mountains dropped, some of them 150 yards, disclosing peaks that had previously been hidden from sight, the top of the snow-capped volcano Villarica blew off, ejecting pumice and ash over one of the most picturesque sections of Chile. During the excitement a river 300 feet wide completely disappeared, and a big lake overflowed its shores.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Lassen and Katmai</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font5">LL America was much interested </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">few years ago when Mount Lassen, in the southern part of Shasta County, California, became eruptive. The eruption did not amount </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">much, however. For excitement along this line we have to depend upon the geysers of the Yellowstone. In August, 1922, in that region, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">quiet mud pool suddenly began operations and is now the largest geyser in the district, throwing a column of steaming hot mud and rocks three hundred feet into the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the most tremendous volcanic eruptions in history was that of Mount Katmai, Alaska, in 1912. Prior to that time, Kilauea of Hawaii was considered the largest active crater on earth. Kilauea’s depth is 500 feet; Katihai's depth is 3,700 feet, its width three miles. When Katmai blew up it broke up an area of fifty square miles, from which hot gases and molten material are even now flowing. The column of steam was conspicuous one hundred and fifty miles away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the top of the mountain blew off, the force was so great that every part of it was reduced to finest dust The explosion was heard eight hundred miles distant. Two thousand miles away, the fumes tarnished brass; and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font5">that distance, linen hung out on the line to dry was so eaten by the sulphuric-acid content </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font5">to fall to pieces on the ironing-board. Four hundred miles away the acid raindrops caused stinging burns wherever they fell on face or hands. Ashes a foot deep fell a hundred miles in all directions, and within the whole area </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">the ashfall stygian blackness prevailed for sixty hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A hole was blown into the ground where Mount Katmai once stood, within which all the buildings of Greater New York might be placed fifteen times over. During the ashfall the darkness was such that a lantern could not be seen at arm’s length. No lives were lost, however. The district is virtually uninhabited, and there was sufficient warning to enable those in danger to escape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dust from the volcano fell 1,500 miles away. Government officials made careful estimates which showed that six and a quarter cubic miles of earth were ejected by the eruption. The fine dust carried into the upper atmosphere formed </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">haze which so reduced the intensity of sunshine as to cause the cold Summer of 1912 throughout the northern hemisphere. All great volcanic explosions have been followed by pronounced drops in temperature, the world over. During that Summer, the dust veil interfered with the work of the astronomical laboratories and, it is estimated, absorbed ten percent of the sun's heat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The millions of cubic feet of carbon dioxide given off by the explosion constitute food for plant life, and are an indispensable basis from which all human foods are built up.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Kilauea and Mauna Loa</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">KILAUEA (Hawaii), &quot;the world’s safest volcano,” is almost as well known as Vesuvius.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19231024_files/g_E_19231024-2.png" alt="" style="width:16pt;height:17pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">The crater covers an area of 2,700 acres, and is eight miles in circumference. In the center of the crater is a lake of boiling lava 1,000 feet in diameter. There is a good automobile road leading almost to its edge. This is made possible because the walls of the crater have been broken down on one side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A writer in the Chicago </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Evening Post,</span><span class="font5"> describing a visit into the crater of Kilauea, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“A descent into the crater of Kilauea lends a certain, awful majesty to fear. Despite the assurance of one's guide that ‘there’s no danger K one can scarcely suppress the desire to scream with terror as he makes his way over the shaking floors of scarce-cooled lava, with unnamed horrors beneath; past redhot rocks and hissing vents; across yawning abysses to the very brink of creation! Man, in the face of this manifestation of mightiness, is small beyond qH expression, a mere dot or cipher in the eternal scheme of world construction and destruction.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Prof. T. A. Jaggar, Jr., the Government volcanologist at Kilauea, is making a careful study of volcanoes and earthquakes. The Hawaiian Islands are a good place to conduct such a study. Of the several active volcanoes there, Kilauea is most favorable for study on^account of the broken crater. At a favorable place in the crater rim a doorway is being cut which will enable scientific investigations to be carried on much closer to the volcanic fires than is possible elsewhere. In the lava lake of Kilauea the surface rises and falls with the tides of the sea, the movement ranging from one to four feet.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Japan, in 1783. Rocks flew in all directions, one of which, measuring 264 feet by 120 feet, fell into a river and formed an island. So much dust was ejected by this explosion that a dry </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">fog</span><span class="font5"> covered the entire earth for months, greatly reducing the temperature. The sun was invisible for some time after rising and before setting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1815 Tomboro, in the East Indies, exploded, ejecting fifty cubic miles of earth into the air. This was the greatest volcanic explosion ever known. At a distance of 850 miles, volcanic ash fell to a depth of two feet. The next year, 1816, is known as the year without a Summer, due to the interception of the sun's rays by the dust which still persisted in the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1883 Krakatoa, another East Indian volcano, exploded, ejecting three and two-tenths cubic miles of material into the air. This explosion although only half as great as Katmai </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font5">much more violent. The dust particles </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font5">blown so high that it required two years for them to settle down to the level of the highest clouds. The explosion was heard at a point 2,968 miles distant, where it sounded like the distant roar of heavy guns. Barometers showed that the air wave circled the globe seven times before it became too faint to be detected. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Two </span><span class="font5">years after the eruption, there was still a twelve percent loss in the sun’s power, due to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">dust </span><span class="font5">yet remaining aloft. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>The Anthracite Settlement</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">O</span><span class="font5">NE more crisis in the anthracite coal indus</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">try came to an end at Harrisburg, when Governor Pinchot, early in September, succeeded in bringing about a two-year truce between the miners and the operators. There are only 310 anthracite mines, all of them in the northeastern part of the one state of Pennsylvania; yet they supply fuel to one-half of all the homes in the United States. Their stoppage, even for a day, means the withdrawal from market of about a thousand tons for each mine, and the enforced idleness of an imaginary freight train forty miles long, with all its engines and cabooses. The stoppage this year was for twenty days; hence the train was eight hundred miles long before it got under way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That a cessation in the production of anthracite coal amounts in effect to the murder of thousands of persons was brought out by Governor Pinchot in his statement that during the months of January, February, and March, 1923, in the state of Pennsylvania alone, there were six thousand more deaths than in the same three months of 1922. In the period first named there Was a coal shortage, while in the other period coal was plentiful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By as clever a political move as was ever made in America, the federal Government shifted the responsibility from the national administration at Washington to the state administration at Harrisburg. Had Governor Pinchot failed to bring about a settlement, the national administration could have evaded some measure of blame; and as Pennsylvania is a Republican state the Republican party would supposedly have Buffered little.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Had Governor Pinchot failed to bring a settlement by agreement, he could still have tried </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">put into operation in Pennsylvania some kind of compulsory work plan, which would perhaps have operated the mines under a sort of glorified peonage system. The Republican party could then have claimed for putting this power into Mr. Pinchot’s hands such glory as would have been advisable under the circumstances. Where such a move was popular, the party could have claimed credit for it; where it was unpopular, Mr. Pinchot could have been blamed tor it. We understand that the Courts, and prop</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">io</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">erly, we think, have repudiated Governor </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Allen’s </span><span class="font5">Kansas Industrial Court. He went too far.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. Pinchot has gained a large place for himself by succeeding in bringing about a settlement. Moreover, he has stoutly claimed that the increased cost of sixty cents a ton made necessary by the settlement ought not to increase the cost to consumers by even one cent. He cites the fact, well known by all who have given the subject attention, that the operators have been making great profits, profits out of which they could well spare ten cents of the sixty cents, and that the wholesalers and retailers could well spare the remainder. He has called a council of the governors of the anthracite-using states to see whether plans can be devised to prevent the disproportionate rise in the prices to consumers which always follows a small rise in cost. Meantime, coal has gone up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One thing the money powers will not at all permit is a lessening of their profits. The operators had no sooner emerged from the conference than they began moaning about how the increased prices which they must now charge would seriously restrict the anthracite market. Thus they are discounting in advance all that Governor Pinchot will try to do to keep coal prices at their present high level.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">would like to see the miners get enough so that they can live in decency and comfort. The anthracite miners are not overpaid. Many mines are worked on a contract basis, the contractor receiving all that is paid in excess of a living wage. There are miners in Scranton who, because of this, travel long distances back and forth to their work in other districts, so that they may escape'the lower wages and inferior working conditions of Scranton itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Miners living in Scranton who have averaged $6.50 per day elsewhere claim that in Scranton, under the conditions that have obtained, $4.50 would have been about the best they could have done. $4.50 a day, at present prices, is not much to receive for risking your life every day, working in the dark, in the wet, in the grime, in the gas, and in a place where there are no toilet facilities. Some of the old </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font5">e workings, because of the latter sanitary item, are places which no man would enter but for necessity of gaining a livelihood. Probably the operators would say that the miners would not use the toilets if they were provided; but perhaps they are mistaken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A thing which in the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font5">ds of Scranton residents has created a bad impression of the honesty of operators is that formerly there were great mountains of culm, millions of tons of coal waste, for which the miners never received a cent. Honest people were glad, rather than sorry, when they saw the operators washing this culm and selling every particle of coal which it contained, even down to the size of rice; but they are not glad, and they are not happy now, when they see these operators deliberately </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">mixi</span><span class="font5">ng the black and worthless rock that remains with freshly-mined coal and sending it all over the country to sell at $10 to $20 per ton to honest people. The thing is being done openly, with nobody sufficiently interested in the welfare of the people to intervene.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Governor Pinchot urged upon President Coolidge that the findings of the United States coal commission on profits and costs in mine operation and in wholesale and retail distribution should be made public in great detail at once. He also suggests turning on anew full light on the rates charged for the transportation of anthracite coal with a view to their reduction. These suggestions are timely.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Herrin and the Press</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE coal commission has already published some interesting and indeed remarkable findings. One of these is in respect to the scenes of horror in Herrin, Illinois, where twenty-six non-union miners were murdered and no punishment for the crimes could be obtained, even though six of the non-union men were marched through the paved streets of the city on the way to the cemetery where they were executed, and the population knew about </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font5">and witnessed the tragedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For this state of affairs the commission blames the labor-hating public press in the following language:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Nobody can tell how much this had to do with the failure to punish the members of the mob. It was the storm of protest that swept through the public press of this country. It was the condemnation of the union, the union officials and the public officers. It presented the common aspect of a stranger interfering in a family row. The commission, of course, cannot say what might have been the result if public opinion had waited until the courts had either attempted or refused to discharge their duty. But the whole economic life of the county puts it beyond peradventure that when an indiscriminate assault on the union and the people of the county was made it rendered the punishment of anybody impossible in that county ”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Mining by Convict Labor</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">TN THE states of Alabama and Tennessee, the Steel Trust and three other mining concerns manage to prevent coal strikes by hiring the convicts of those states to work their mines. These convicts can avoid flogging by producing one ton of coal per day the first month, two the second month, three the third month, and four tons per day the fourth month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After they have produced four tons per day they may work the remainder of the time until quitting time and receive the same wages for excess coal produced as is paid to free men for the same work. They earn considerable money in this way. The state physician determines which men may be relieved of the responsibility of working underground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Formerly these convicts slept in bunks two high, and no heed was paid to the question of cleanliness. Now, in Alabama, they must bathe after coming out of the mines, and they do not have to sleep in their working clothes, as was once the case, and as still is the case with the convicts working on the roads.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Child Labor Outrage</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5">N A few more months it will be just a hundred years since the tailoresses of New York city organized the first woman’s labor union. Since then women’s labor unions have abolished the sweat-shop in the clothing industry. Women and men workers still have much to do before ideal labor conditions will have come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Mississippi more than one-fourth of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font5">the children ten to fifteen years of age are </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font5">work; Rhode Island works one-eighth of its children; California, Washington and Oregon work only three percent of them. But in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">United States as a whole there are more than a million of these little folks at work. Congress has twice tried to prevent this child labor, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font5">in both instances the Supreme Court held that the laws were unconstitutional.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since the Supreme Court made its last decision that Congress cannot legally prohibit or limit child labor, the slavery of American children has been on the increase. Recently the Department of Labor discovered nearly a thousand of them in Newark and Jersey City engaged in what amounts to work under sweatshop wages and conditions. In Waterbury, Connecticut, because of this ruling, there are eight times as many child workers as a year ago. Tuberculosis is common among child workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since the Supreme Court made its last decision a frail girl of ten years, tubercular, was found in Jersey, hard at work making rompers for talking dolls. She had but recently been operated upon to remove a needle which she had swallowed while at work. One of the standard jobs for such little folks is the linking and wiring of rosary beads. Which is right under the circumstances, Hail Mary, or Bloody Mary? The pay runs from four or five to as high as ten cents an hour. It thus appears that by working hard all day these little folks could possibly earn the price of one meal in the cheapest and dirtiest of restaurants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are 1,350 children working in the shrimp canneries on the Gulf Coast. The flesh of their hands becomes raw and sore from the shrimp acid and from shrimp thorns run into their hands. One little girl reported that she used twenty-five cents worth of alum per week in order to keep her hands in such condition that She could continue her work. In the beetfields of Michigan and Colorado the children get so fatigued that they weep and moan and are unable to eat.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The banks carry on this scheme through an Industrial Commission, so-called, which virtually every business man in the city has been compelled to join, and which is busily engaged </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">teaching the building trades to youths in the briefest time possible.</span></p>

This makes the employers absolute dictators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Los Angeles is not an industrial city; its residents are principally from the East, small business men that have made some money and have sought Los Angeles for a home; hence the ease with which the Association’s program </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font5">been carried through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every employee that gets blacklisted by the Association's secret service force may as well </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">leave </span><span class="font5">Los Angeles; for he cannot find work </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">there. </span><span class="font5">Whenever there is a Strike the Association sends to Kansas City or Chicago and brings in all the help needed to take the strik</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ers' places.</span></p>

The federal government has interfered during recent years in so many things with which it had no proper right to interfere that it seems to us here is one thing in which it might interfere, so that men of little or no principle might at least find it harder to abandon the helpless victims of their perfidy.</span></p>

Without a doubt he is right. He holds that there are three essentials of civilization: Beauty (the maintenance of cleanliness, order and comfort) ; service (the desire to assist others, regardless of who they are); and truth (unwillingness to participate in or to profit by anything that is not right). These and other similar expressions stamp Sir Auckland as a great man.</span></p>

The city at that time was under the control of Roman Catholic authorities. In the great concourse in which the anarchistic onslaught was made there was not a policeman on hand, though the meeting was one of the greatest ever held in Vienna.

<p><span class="font5">Now it is in such evil state that the Governor of Oklahoma has been forced to suspend the state constitution in Tulsa County and to place the whole county under martial law, with </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">view to breaking up the mob violence and floggings which in recent years have given Oklahoma, and especially Tulsa, such a bad name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">NEW YORK and Brooklyn each had an Italian mob on September 3rd, crazed because the police would not permit them to parade the streets with statues of Saint Rosalia. Forbidden by the police they rushed to a rectory in Brooklyn, calling out to the priest, “You have more power than the police. If you give us the order, the police will let us parade.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As far as carrying Saint Rosalia in the parade is concerned, a bundle of rags would have been every bit as effective; and as far as the priests actual power in this country is concerned, it is on a par with that of Saint Rosalia. These Italians have the idea that they are still in Sicily. They have something to learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">IT SEEMS unfortunate that it is so, but the way the law stands only 300 Australians can come to the United States each year to settle, but 30,000 Italians can come. We have nothing against the Italians; they are industrious and honest and make good Americans, but they have to learn our language and to forget a lot of nonsense about what Saint Rosalia and other saints can do for them. But the Australians are not thus handicapped. Moreover, and that is the unhappy part of it, the Australians do not like the situation in which they find themselves. They threaten a graduated embargo on American goods, which they consume in large quantities, as a partial offset.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Moreover, some Australians like a nip of “firewater'’ at their meals and they do not like to have their ships sail dry all the way from Vancouver to Sydney merely because they touch at the Hawaiian Islands enroute. But they might as well learn to get along without the liquor now; for the prospects are that they will have to do so when the Lord’s kingdom is in full control And that will not be long now.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>League of Nations Defied</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">S THE World War grew out of the assassination of an Austrian archduke, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">so </span><span class="font5">another and greater and final conflict may arise from the assassination of the Italian officers serving on the Albanian Border Commission. Italy seeks expansion east of the Adriatic Sea. Largely to please her, a mythical country of Albania, adjoining Greece on the Adriatic, has been in process of formation, or attempted formation, for some ten years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Greece and Italy were attempting to definitely fix the borders of this supposedly independent Mussulman state; their interests conflicted; the Italian delegates were suddenly killed; Italy blamed Greece and issued a twenty-four-hour and then a five-hour ultimatum imposing such severe conditions as would be hard for any country to accept.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Greece accepted most of the conditions, but sought modification of others, whereupon Italy seized the unfortified island of Corfu (forty miles long, population 225,000), the key to the Adriatic Sea, and killed fifteen, and wounded fifty Armenian orphan refugees housed in an old fort, in a bombardment that was unresisted and entirely unnecessary. Other islands in the vicinity have been seized since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Italy refused to pay any attention to her treaty obligations covered by Articles 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 of the League of Nations Covenant, and the League, that monument of hypocrisy, did not, as required, “sever all trade and financial relations and prevent all intercourse between their own nationals .and those of the offending state and between that state and the nationals of any other state, whether a member of the League or not.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It thus becomes once more apparent that the strong members of the League pay no attention to their League obligations, and that the League itself does nothing to back up its own obligations. In other words, the League is as though it were not Greece and Italy are both League members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was as inter-allied officials, acting under the direction of the Council of Ambassadors, representatives of the Supreme Allied Council of the League, and not as officers of their country, that the Italian officers were serving on the Albanian border commission. They were three miles over the border into Grecian territory ■when slain, but had a right to be there. The nationality of the assassins, or the cause of the assassination, is unknown.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>Mussolini** Brand of Bravery</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5">N REFUSING to recognize the League of Nations, and in precipitately murdering the fifteen child refugees at Corfu, the government of the anarchist premier of Italy, Mussolini, has done as might have been expected of it Even the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font5"> which apparently approved Mussolini’s ruthless destruction of Italian liberties, says that &quot;the reviver of Roman imperialism ought to be reminded that Cfesar, though not wholly blameless in his public life, never assaulted a cripple.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mussolini is absolutely heartless, or he would remember that Greece is exhausted from a disastrous war, is bankrupt, and is struggling to continue the support of a million refugees hitherto largely accomplished by American aid. He wanted over $2,000,000 indemnity, all of which, if paid, would in effect be food taken from the mouths of refugees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As excuses for the violence at Corfu, Italy points to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">American occupation of</span><span class="font5"> Vera Cruz; and for her virtual ignoring of the League of Nations she points to similar violations of the League’s wishes by France in the Ruhr, by Poland in Vilna and by Yugoslavia. Britain occupied Corfu, against the wishes of its inhabitants, for a full half century upto 1864.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Oddly enough, a month before the Italian forces occupied Corfu an Italian warship visited the island, and squads of Italian marines. covered every part of the forty-two miles length of the island on foot, while their officers scoured the roads by automobile. Possession of Corfu by Italy makes the Adriatic Sea an Italian lake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mussolini has definitely decided that Italy shall withdraw from the League of Nations if that august body tries to see that justice is done to Greece. Greece appealed to the League for relief, but in vain. The only excuse for the existence of the League is to protect and help the weak nations when they are oppressed by the stronger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mussolini’s Brand of Anarchy</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font5">T KANSAS CITY, Mo., on the 31st of August, a federation of liberty-loving Italo-Americans very properly adopted resolutions denouncing the effort to transplant to America the Mussolini brand of anarchy. We quote their resolution:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The Fascist! dictatorship in Italy has completely destroyed constitutional government and has outlawed all labor unions and labor political parties that do not subscribe to its nefarious creed, wantonly and traitorously murdering thousands of men, women and children, and imprisoning in filthy medieval dungeons over 60,000 men and women without charge or indictments.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mussolini is an ardent Roman Catholicfand covets and receives the support of the papal system in his efforts to spread his brand of anarchy throughout the world. Fascism© is growing in every Roman Catholic country. Afi the Roman Catholic church has never hesitated to’support war where it thought that it might possibly gain something thereby, so now it is ready even to support a brand of anarchy with the same end in view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Perth Amboy, N. J., is a strong Roman Catholic town. Recently the citizens of this town, some of them, beat and stoned knights of the Ku Klux Klan engaged in the innocent pastime of parading streets which as long as they behaved themselves they had as much right </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to </span><span class="font5">parade as anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Klan thereupon demanded the protection of the law, a thing to which they were entitled, and which should have been theirs without demand. Klansmen have been attacked recently in Binghamton and in Steubenville, and one was killed in Pittsburgh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are not Klansmen, but we demand for Klansmen all the rights in this country that Roman Catholics and others enjoy. In Perth Amboy within recent years priests have incited mobs to break up free Bible lectures which contained nothing offensive to any truth-loving person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are tired of seeing the Roman Catholic fifteen percent of the population of this country trying to control the other eighty-five percent by every means in their power, politically and legally, and then resorting to anarchy when they cannot gain their ends in any other way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We cannot but fear what will happen to the fifteen percent if many of the eighty-five percent turn into Klansmen; and from reports which reach us it seems not unlikely that something of the sort is on the way. The </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Klan </span><span class="font5">limits its membership to native-born Protestanta.</span></p>

The difficulties which have kept the two countries apart have been of a financial nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As soon as the New York financiers could properly get their hands on Mexican income there was no difficulty in arranging recognition. This has now been accomplished and a boom in Mexican securities follows as a matter of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mexico is a treasure house, one of the greatest stores of natural wealth on earth, and hence a goal of high finance. There is a saying in Mexico that Mexico can produce anything from </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">pine tree to a pineapple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mexico is today the only country in the world that is on a strictly metallic basis, only gold and silver money being in circulation. Up until now Mexico has had no “national bank of issue,” and the people have known nothing about paper money.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">OR some time now the United States postoffice department has maintained air mail service between New York and San Francisco, the flying taking place only in the day time. The rate of postage is twenty-four cents for each half ounce. The equivalent of a thousand trips across the continent has been made without a fatality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On August 21-24, after sixteen months’ preparation, all-night flying was inaugurated on a plan which enables the mail plane to leave New York at noon, and arrive at San Francisco the next evening. Chicago is reached the first evening, Omaha at midnight, Cheyenne at daybreak, Salt Lake City at noon. The route is via Bellefonte, Cleveland, Bryan, Chicago, Iowa City, Omaha, North Platte, Cheyenne, Rawlins, Rock Springs, Salt Lake City, Elko, and Reno.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The all-night service was maintained four days, after the airway course between Chicago and Cheyenne had been carefully laid out, lights and signals set, emergency fields located and supplies distributed. After the results have been carefully analyzed the all-night service will be maintained for a month, and then again carefully analyzed. In time a reasonably regular all-night service will no doubt be maintained It staggers the imagination to think of leaving New York at noon and landing in San Francisco the next evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THE ZR-1, 962 feet long, weight 75,000 pounds, Uncle Sam’s largest dirigible, completed her trial trip of thirty miles, September 14, the next day thrilling the inhabitants of New York and Brooklyn, then turning her nose toward Philadelphia, going at a speed of a mile a minute as gracefully as a soaring eagle. The crew consists of nine officers and twenty-two petty officers. With four of her six engines going she made a trial speed, while traveling with the wind, of forty miles an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ANOTHER cantilever bridge 207 feet in height, is in process of construction across the gorge where the Niagara River rushes at the rate of twenty-three miles per hour toward the whirlpool. The excavations for the new bridge abutments are being made by the aid of a gigantic steam shovel that was lowered over the edge of the cliff. The earth and rock from the excavations are being dumped into the river, which carries them away as though they were so much sawdust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first time the Niagara gorge was spanned was by a New York boy named Homan Walsh, about seventy-five years ago. After eight days of effort he succeeded in flying a kite from bank to bank. The kite string was used to haul </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">heavier line and subsequently a cable. Passengers were carried in an iron basket on the cable for several years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other cables were added; then came sidewalks and at length a railway bridge, over which the first locomotive crossed March </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,  </span><span class="font5">1855. For many years this bridge, the old Suspension Bridge, was the only bridge across the river. It was replaced in 1897 by a steel arch bridge, and there are now two other bridges across the chasm, besides a cable basket over the whirlpool</span></p>

The toiling masses have labored for, fought for, and died for these oppressors. The hardy Lydians were forced to work in tribute mines and upon the banks of the Pactolus that Croesus might become the rich man of the ancients. After their ruler was defeated by Cyrus they were absorbed as part of the Persian Empire, and this was a cruel yoke. The greedy satraps under Cyrus placed an almost unbearable system of taxation upon the subjects. The best men physically were called into the army to fight for the king, so that all lands from the Indies to the Hellespont did obeisance to the mighty Cyrus. But too greedy, he broke the spirit of his people. The masses became disheartened by years of servitude and oppression. An unjust war was waged against the Massagetee; </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">battle was lost, and the king was killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As Cyrus did, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">bo many rulers since</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Have crushed the very souls that bore them up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The hoplites of the Grecian army were culled from the laboring masses and were forced to spill their blood that riches might be heaped up for their king. Phalanx after phalanx was sacrificed upon the battlefield before the Greeks became disheartened and disgusted with their rulers. The ruddy-faced plebeians of the Tiber also were zealous in collecting talents for the Csesars, and almost every sea and river of Europe *drank the blood of Roman stock that the coffers might be filled. But these hoodwinked Romans also woke up one day to the fact that they were fighting for the wrong king, and they stopped fighting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We cannot overlook the noble and commendable spirit of loyalty in the hearts of these people to their kings, and that spirit lasted as long as they put confidence in their rulers as public benefactors. Time and again, however, history has revealed that their rulers, with few exceptions, were their oppressors. Those who would rule well have been forced to beat their swords and shields </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">music to the tune of proteges. The people, lulled -to sleep by this strange music, have been tramped upon and almost crushed. At times they woke up and have wreaked </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">frightful vengeance upon their overlords, only to be shifted from one yoke to another. In desperation they sought </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">one </span><span class="font5">king, then another, but often found themselves tossed from the hands of an autocrat into the daws of a despot</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Oh, for a king of the people I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The masses were unable to extricate themselves from bondage, and the drama of oppression went on. The proletariat of France were almost overwhelmed by the heavy exactions of Louis XVL Under </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5"> were about a quarter of a million favored nobles and clergy. They owned half of the soil of France, the castles, chateaux, and buildings of note. They squeezed out of the peasants three-fourths of what they earned. Such an exacting system of revenue was imposed that one could not pass over </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">road with a sack of grain without paying toll The peasants in the rural districts at timea lived on bread made of ground acorns, bark and bran. The working people, pitiable dumps of tattered rags and despair, were huddled together in cellars and dingy rooms which literally stank. Twenty-three million squalor-stricken, threadbare, starving wretches </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font5">having their souls ground down to support a handful of sluggards in luxury. But the question is, Did they wake up! They did. As in a nightmare they rose up like madmen; seizing clubs and flails they slew the oppressing nobility and clergy, set on fire the chateaux of their former landlords, and hurried the king and the queen off to the scaffold. The conflagration spread and in a very short time all Europe was in the throes of bloodshed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let no one casually read of the French Revolution; for that was but a side-show to the one that is sure to come, if our leaders—preachers, financiers, and law-making bodies—do not &quot;right about face” and serve the interests of our common humanity instead of trying to reestablish normalcy in feathering their own nests; for they all should be the servants of the people. 'At no time in past history has there been such wide oppression of the people. The burdens placed upon the backs of the poor are far greater than at any other time. Far more people are involved to intensify the final cataclysm. The people will stand oppression until their lives and their dear ones are in jeopardy. Even then, at times, they resign themselves to the lot of death, when not confident in their ability to extricate themselves; but this is not the case when tens of millions are pitted against a paltry few. Armies spring up in a single night,' weapons of all kinds are seized in an instant, and they run like madmen to their prey.</span></p>

In another industry, the canning of corn, the labor cost increased 22% between 1918 and 1919, but the canners’ profit increased 256%. Also in the iron industry, the labor cost of making a ton of iron increased from forty cents to eighty-six cents; but the price of the iron itself rose from $15 to $30 per ton from 1916 to 1919.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The super-profits of big business per annum from 1916 onward have been approximately $4,800,000,000 per annum. The workers during the same period of time lost each year in wages because of the deterioration of the dollar $4,717,440,000, or nearly the exact amount of the profits of the corporations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The companies listed below in 1922 voted the corresponding stock dividends:</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Denver Dry Goods Co 900%</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This means that for every dollar invested in the Brown &amp;&nbsp;Sharp Manufacturing Company there is a return of $160; and a corresponding return for the percentage named after each company. There are no figures in the category of history that will in any way compare with these gouging dividends of modern money kings. Are our homes any safer now than before the days of the war scare! No!

<h5><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>Legalized Tactics</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">UT the inquirer asks: &quot;How do they do this money-grabbing?” Almost all the low and subtle tactics imaginable are resorted to in order to accomplish the money-massing. One of the most popular and powerful means employed is that of usury, whereby the loan shark preys upon the people whenever the government is in need of funds. There is a public improvement and the government, instead of paying for it immediately, borrows from Mr. Rich Man. We notice, however, that the willing lender always affixes the interest clause. And what happens? The interest alone in many cases would pay for the improvement several times over. For example, fifty years ago the city of Cleveland installed a new pump and mains for its water works at the total cost of $400,000. The city borrowed the money on bonds to pay for the improvement That city has paid $1,060,000 in interest on those bonds, and the original debt of $400,000 is said to be still unpaid. The people of Cleveland, not having learned the lesson, three years ago voted the sale of $6,000,000 more bonds for the erection of a city hall. When the time arrives for the payment of the latter bonds Cleveland will have paid nearly $20,000,000 for her public hall. In 1920 the city discovered that sixty percent of the money raised by taxation was already obligated for the payment of interest and principal on bonds contracted in years gone by. In many instances improvements like the water pump just mentioned were worn out before the principal could be paid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The common tactics employed in usury permit the banker to loan out five dollars for every dollar which he possesses. One would naturally suppose this to be impossible. If a man had five automobiles and they were all hired out, he would be limited to his further hiring out until the return of some of them; but not so with money bearing interest. Mr. A. borrows $1,000 from the bank and applies it to his credit. Little money leaves the bank as his checks are credited to the accounts in the particular bank or in the banking system. Later another man, Mr. B, borrows $1,000; it is placed to his credit, and the process goes on five times. In this manipulation it makes no difference whether the loan is re-deposited in that particular bank or in another bank—it is deposited in the system. The transference of the loan from one bank to another is offset by money borrowed from another bank and deposited with it. The bank is prevented from much exceeding the five-handed transaction by^the banking law which requires the holding of fifteen percent as a reserve, but theoretically the bank would be privileged to turn it over six and two-thirds times. This scheme has been carried on with remarkable success in the United States. With $5,806,571,880 outside the United States Treasury vaults in 1919 the loans of the banks </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">this country were $25,222,849,814. It is much like a man who has five overcoats, but who can account for having obtained only one of them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">SUBTERFUGE was played upon the American people during the last </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">war </span><span class="font5">which few are aware of. In order to carry on her part by borrowing all the money from the wealthy financiers, as is generally done, the government, operating under the control of big business, applied different tactics, which turned to the benefit of Wall Street. Just before America entered the war the British Government was indebted to J. P. Morgan and Company to the amount of $400,000,000. When the prospect of the Allies winning the war was very uncertain in 1917 the big financial corporations pulled the strings whereby this nation was inveigled into the war. Had the Allies lost the war the prospects of the Morgan Company of ever being reimbursed would have been shattered. The Allies called for war material, food, railway equipment, etc., from the United States. We raised through Liberty Bonds for loans to Europe covering such demands $11,000,000,000. The greater part of this sum was not paid over directly to the Allies, but was handed over to Wall Street to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font5">credited </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">the various corporations for war material sent abroad. Wall Street bankers, however, in the meantime have been drawing interest upon the loans which the American people intended for Europe. Of course the American bankers are calling for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">cancellation of the foreign debts to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When profits were growing larger during the war a tax was placed upon incomes, and the tax would have consumed a great part of the larger incomes had it been enforced. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">law</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">demanded a certain percent upon all incomes of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">cash</span><span class="font5"> dividends. The Supreme Court of the United States by a close decision of five to four stated that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">stock</span><span class="font5"> dividends were non-taxable. Since that time the large investors have evaded the law on the strength of the stock dividend appellation. And how does it work </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font5"> A corporation capitalized at $100,000 declares a dividend of $100,000. If the dividend were paid to the stockholders directly in cash, it would be taxed under the income tax law; but it is converted into corporation stock and thus exempted from tax. The corporation capital is increased by this stock dividend to $200,000, and thud the late dividend is but fifty percent of the new doubled capital. The stockholder loses nothing in this manipulation, is credited with the full amount of his income, and is exempted from taxation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We might expect that as the result of this evasion the income of the Federal Government would take a rapid decline. This is just what did happen. The official statistics show that during the year 1922 the Federal income under this tax law fell off $1,397,000,000. And this has taken place while the dividends of the large corporations have been on the increase by leaps and bounds. It is apparent that the failure of the nation's income has not been due to any decline in the dividends of the large corporations. The tax fountain is drying up because Big Money has by high-priced and professional legal advice found a way to avoid taxation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">_ Every time the law is avoided in this way there must be increased burdens upon the common people. The expenses of the nation must be met; and the money not coming from the former source, the responsibility is shifted upon the poor in the form of direct taxes—or, as has been suggested, by a sales tax. This being the case the little man must bear not only his own burden but also that of his big brother.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>Rumblings of the Coming Storm</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">W</span><span class="font5">ITH such conditions in mind we should not wonder at the events of the past few years. The restless spirit in the oppressed people has occasionally shown signs of remonstrance. The American soldier boy returning home expected to be reinstated in his former job. But his expectation failed of realization, and so in order to effect a compromise he asked the government for a bonus. Time and again his demands have been refused. He forgets </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to  </span><span class="font5">reckon that big business has its eye upon </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">few remaining pennies in the pockets of the people; and in the contest for this paltry sum : our boys who fought in Europe must lose. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">If </span><span class="font5">there were any dividends for the rich man in this measure the bonus would have gone through long ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Crime is on the increase as never before </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">the history of the nation. Wade H. Ellis, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">member on the committee of the American </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Bar </span><span class="font5">Association to investigate crime, says that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">the period from 1910 to 1921 the number </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">murders in cities like New York, Chicago, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">St. </span><span class="font5">Louis, Los Angeles, and others increased nearly 150 percent, and that compared with statistics from England and France this increase is appalling. A questionnaire was submitted </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to  </span><span class="font5">authorities in the leading cities in New England asking them what they considered to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font5">the chief cause of the sudden increase of crime.  Seventy-five percent of the answers </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font5">to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">i effect that unemployment was the chief cause. The Great War, and the failure to enforce the Volstead Act were given the places of next </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">im- </span><span class="font5">j portance respectively. Certainly these are </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font5">the threatening rumblings of the fast approaching storm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">HE Lord, centuries ago through the prophet | Joel, gave us a picture of the dark day in which the people will rise against their oppressors. “A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as j the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall there be any more after it, even to the years of many generations. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font5">fire devoureth before them; and behind them </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">flame burneth: the land is like the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them. The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run. Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame ; of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong • people set in battle array. Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather blackness. They shall run like mighty</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks: neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in his path: and when they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded. They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief. The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble; the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining: and the Lord shall utter his voice before his army: for his camp is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?’<sup>7</sup>—Joel 2:2-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Prophet here gives a detailed description of a disciplined army accustomed to the horrors of war. Such an army fought at Con-tigny, Chateau Thierry, Belleau Wood, and St. Mihiel. They fought then, being deceived, for the money kings; but in the next great conflict they will not do so. Millions have been .trained to shoot unerringly; they have been disciplined while running at full speed to thrust the bayonet clean through the human body and half-way up the musket shaft; they have been taught how to handle clubs and bombs. The English boys were even instructed how with their finger nails to gouge the eyes from their victims<sup>7</sup> heads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At first the wealthy, who have heaped treasures for the last days (James 5:3), may seek to make a compromise after seeing that the masses have secured the upper hand, and that their lives and possessions are in jeopardy. But this will not avail; for the people at that time will have learned the lesson of the empty pledges of the past. They may in final desperation offer the tangible cash. “They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the Lord.” (Ezekiel 7:19) Many of these will seek to vomit up their riches as one in desperate agony tries to expel the deadly hemlock poison. They will mourn the day that made them rich. The prophet Job describes the sick man in these words: “He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly. He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper’s tongue shall slay him.”—Job 20:15,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The events of the past few years in foreign countries picture the coming calamity. At the outset of the Russian revolution the lands and possessions of the wealthy were seized, and the plutocrats themselves were quickly exterminated. The hungry maniacs in the Ural district ate human beings, and in some cases dug up corpses in ordel to find food to sustain life. China has been the scene of marauding bands. Thousands driven by starvation sweep the country, burning, pillaging, and killing as they go. The rich are forced to play upon musical instruments before the maddened mob while their burning mansions light up the furious spectacle. The slaughtering instinct of the Turk, the tearing of the body by instruments of torture, the hanging of people by their toes to die of slow starvation, the cutting of the limbs piecemeal until gradual death overtakes the victim—all of these things startle us. We might think that the world is too civilized ever to be the scene of such cruelty. But listen to what the Lord’s prophet has to say about the coming calamity upon all of Christendom: “I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease: and their holy places shall be defiled. Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none &quot;&nbsp;(Ezekiel 7:24, 25) So great will be the slaughter in that day that the multitude will not take time to bury the dead, and a stench will fill the air. “The slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.”—Jeremiah 25:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some will be inclined to take exception to such a picture. Those who love the Lord and His righteousness will proclaim the truth. In the spirit of love is pointed out the only haven of safety during the coming storm. No one for a moment would question the motive of the Government in sending out messages from the weather bureau to warn the people of an approaching cyclone. Those hearing the warning may find shelter for both themselves and their cattle, and thus much property and life may be saved. There is a warning to give, and those whose hearts are right may also find safety in this dark night “Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord's anger ” (Zephaniah 2:3) Those who hope to find protection in the coming trouble should not rely upon earthly possessions, but such should resign themselves to the Lord and His righteousness. “Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivereth from death.”— Proverbs 11:4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">UT the people have a King. At one time He was here on earth. He was persecuted by the same greedy band that has oppressed humanity for centuries. He undoubtedly had sympathy and love for the people; for He suffered and even gave His life for them. He is the appointed One that will bring peace and quietude after the clouds of world-wide war, revolution, and anarchy have spent their fury. That same voice that stilled the waves on Galilee’s stormy crest will then speak peace to the raging masses of mankind. Associated with Him in this new kingdom will be a band of faithful followers, who also weathered the storms of persecution while here on earth. On account of their faithfulness they are granted the great privilege of reigning with Christ Jesus and of blessing all the families of the earth.—Revelation 20:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Earth’s new King will put down all oppression, and will encourage every desire of the people toward righteousness. The stony heart of selfishness will be replaced by a fervent desire to benefit others. Under His reign the poor and needy will be shown favor; for they will be generally in a better attitude to come into harmony with the laws of the new order. The wicked must retrace their steps if they would have life. “He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness. He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor. They shall fear thee as long </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font5">the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations. He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that water the earth. In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endur-eth. He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.’^-Psalm 72:2-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The experience which the people have had under oppression in the past will redound to their everlasting benefit. When justice will be done in the earth the people will make an intelligent choice to do righteousness, having at that time the knowledge and past experience of sin. The oppressed, having been driven from yoke to yoke under earth’s former kings, will breathe the air of liberty with an increased appreciation of the new Ruler. The millions who have toiled, and bled, and died in despair at the hands of treacherous kings will have new hopes enkindled within their breasts. There will be riches for all the obedient; there will be a close bond of brotherhood; and there will be a King who will guard the interests of his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The purpose of the reign of Christ is to bring the people to God so that He may ultimately receive all the glory and praise. The prophet Isaiah in speaking for Jehovah relates the ultimate purpose of man’s existence: “I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.” (Isaiah 43:7) Certainly this text-could not have applied during Isaiah's day nor since; for man in his present condition is everything but a glory to God. But they will be a glory to Jehovah when mankind brought to perfection will reflect the character-likeness of their God. David wrote the praises that will be upon the lips of the joyous hosts of earth: “Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee. O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah. Let the people praise thee, 0 God; let all the people praise thee. Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us. God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">shall </span><span class="font5">fear [reverence] him.”—Psalm 67:3-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">‘Taith rests upon the Word of Grace, Upon the work of God abides: No man God’s purpose can erase, The trustful saint in Christ confides: Abundant love is free for aye, God will not cast His own awaj.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE English Government gives the number of unemployed at 1,247,000. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1 do not</span><span class="font5"> know whether the Bible states that all governments are liars, but these figures are certainly wrong </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font5">regards the number of unemployed. This I will prove from my own experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I have been traveling throughout the country with the idea of finding a house or a piece of land on which to erect a wooden bungalow. I ■oon got tired of the Forty Thieves' tales. (There are really more of them than that, and the thieves call themselves real estate agents.) One man had bought up some land in Surrey. I found that he had paid £35 an acre for it, and had started to sell it at £100; but the thought of getting a profit of only £65 an acre had so upset his nights’ sleep that he had determined —so his son told the writer—to charge £150 for the rest. He had never advertised his land; 'but it was selling without that aid, though there is no water laid on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the first race day. of the season at Epsom the writer was standing in the High Street, waiting for an omnibus, which did not seem to be running to schedule. Standing on the curb were two men, aged about thirty and forty years respectively, to whom I spoke concerning the buses. I took them to be local out-of-works; but it turned out that they had walked from Whitechapel (in the East End of London, and about sixteen or seventeen miles distant from Epsom), having started at half past eleven on the night previous. It was then about 11 a. m. I asked them how long they had been out of work. They said: “Eighteen months.” They had no unemployment money, but were told that if they each obtained another -twenty stamps on their unemployment cards they would be entitled to more out-of-work pay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Then,” said I, “you are all right for parish relief?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“We are single; and there is no parish relief for  single men; only the casual ward.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I found out that they had had nothing to eat, having no money. I asked them what they expected to do at Epsom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Well, we walked here thinking we might meet a bookmaker whose luggage we might take up to the Course or who might employ us for the day.” Fancy, ye well-fed ones, sixteen miles on an empty stomach, no sleep, and no knowledge of when they would have their next meal!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Who says that the workers, as a body, are lazy!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font5"> told them that they were in the wrong position, and went with them to place them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“You had far rather,” I said, “get some postcards, tear them in half, write a name of one of the horses in each of the races, and sell them at Id. per time. People will probably give you </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">penny out of curiosity; you can get the names out of those tipped by----(a sporting paper).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then I suppose that you have a right to live. Do you know that you are living examples </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">the truth of the Bible?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Under the circumstances they did not think much of the Bible, as they understood it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“You are two ex-soldiers; and you are asking for bread or for the means to get same, are you not?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“That’s right, guv’nor”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Well, have they not given you a stone? You have a beautiful cenotaph erected in Whitehall; and when they laid the foundation-stone all the men that matter—and women, too—had a fine day out. And now you—or our kind—are told that you do not work hard enough and are ordered to produce more. Have you noticed how our kind take in the picture papers so that they can see Lord and Lady This or That and belaud the idleness and luxury there displayed?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After a few more comments, which I think gave them food for thought, I wished them good luck and wended my way further afield.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“COLD morning this morning, sirl”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">/Yes, it is,” I replied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I was taking my way over Hungerford Bridge, which runs from the Thames Embankment to the Strand, one cold and frosty morning when I was accosted thus by a man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Yes, and you notice it more if you have not had a cup of tea or anything to eat”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I thought to myself: I suppose I look innocent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“How does that happen? Haven’t you received your unemployment money this week?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Never had any, sir.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Well, go on,” said I.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Well, it is. like this, sir: I have been in business all my life, struggled on through the last few years, and finally went under with nothing left. Never having been employed, I have no stamps on my card, and so have nothing </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">come from anywhere.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A FRIEND of the writer, an engineer, has been out of work for over two years; his last place he had kept for ten years. He owns his own house. He was told some nine months ago that there was no more out-of-work money for him. Owing to the strain on the funds his society also dropped the money which they used to allow their unemployed. To get a living he had to resort to taking in children whose parents did not want to be bothered with them; and daily he can be seen “pushing” a perambulator along the streets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another man has taken to cleaning windows after serving seven years’ apprenticeship as an engineer. Two others within a stone’s throw of the writer’s residence have no unemployment pay. One of the members of the union to which I belong told me, three or four weeks ago, that there are dozens who do not receive State benefit And we are not a dead society 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A FORTNIGHT ago I was at Bookham, about twenty-four miles from London; and as it looked rather like rain, I went into a little log hut to have a cup of tea. (They are erecting all sorts of houses and bungalows at this spot, in fact right through beyond Guildford.) It was Saturday. Inside the hut I found a young man having what turned out to be his dinner. “A cup of tea and four thick, and mind the knife don’t slip!” This being translated means a cup of tea and four thick slices of bread-and-butter, and don’t let the knife go in the wrong direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We got into conversation. We started with that evergreen topic, “the weather”; and could you have seen the sky at that moment you would have excused us. He told me that he had started work six weeks ago on the buildings right opposite, after two years out of work. He was getting 1/1d. per hour as a bricklayers’ laborer, though the money should have been 1/1½d. per hour. But he dare not demur or he would be out of work again. He was married, and had two children, whom he had had to put into the workhouse, owing to his hard luck, at the end of last year. He lived in the New Kent Road, by the side of the Elephant and Castle, South London; and he had to pay 13/- per week for room. He also paid 5/- per week for a bed at Bookham, 2/6d. to go home on the Saturday (he was then having his dinner while waiting for the bus), and  2/6d. to come back again on Monday mornings. So, you see, he could not possibly buy a Rolls-Royce, whatever his desire might have been. &quot;And the first week I was in work the workhouse authorities were after me for payment for my children,* he told me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">COMING along a country by-path I noticed a man behind some trees. Thinking that this might be his way of &quot;pulling-up” people, I passed down the lane; hut not being accosted I wanted to know why I was not. So I went back to find a man who said that his age was sixty-nine, and that he was an agricultural laborer. He had a tin can of water by his side, out of which he occasionally sipped, and occasionally put some on his forehead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“My head feels awfully queer. I don’t know what is the matter with me. I think I shall have to give up. I suppose it is having nothing to eat,” he said. All this was said in a quiet, resigned sort of voice, not a vestige of the canting or begging tone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Agricultural laborers never did have the unemployment money. This old man of sixty-nine had only another year to live when, if a young Government servant could not manage, on coming round to take particulars, to save a bit for the State, he would receive 10/- per week—not having been a Cabinet Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This poor old man was somebody’s father, probably. Is it not sorrowful to contemplate that our aged poor cannot get sufficient money allowed them that they can live their own lives without being forced to go into the workhouse or walk the countryside!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To sum up: The consensus of opinion seemed to be that conditions at present existing could not continue, and that it is only a matter of time until a revolution would break out. The thought is that if one or two determined men started up as leaders it would be like setting a match to a haystack on a hot summer’s day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the roads I have met men and women thinly clad, walking along dreamily, going from here to there, wherever the road might lead. Sometimes they were soaked to the skin. Truly one can wish: <sup>&lt;f</sup>Thy kingdom come,” when there shall he no more poverty, no more sickness, pain or death.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Waste Land—Growing of Fruit</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5">n Isaiah</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;"></span><span class="font5"> 35:1 we find these words: &quot;The wilderness, and the solitary place, shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose” These words apply to the people and conditions of the coming age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have in the world much desert and waste land. Very often we hear the remark made that such land is good for nothing. Yes; many will say that it is worthless, and always will be. But in God’s Word w<sup>T</sup>e have the promise that these places shall blossom as the rose, and make glad the heart of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When one has seen the desert place (on a small scale) made to blossom as the rose, and that which was considered worthless made very productive, and when there is evidence that the changed condition of our atmosphere in the future will make still greater results in reclaiming this waste land, we may well rejoice, knowing that there will always be plenty of good things to eat and that for all people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As an illustration I will give you a glimpse of a desert place that was made to blossom as the rose, and to bring forth not only blossoms but fruit, most abundantly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">About ten years ago a promoter and profiteer organized a company of men to grow cranberries. A barren swamp near Phillips, Wis., was chosen as the place. It produced practically nothing but swamp moss and mosquitoes. Not knowing the ins and outs of the business, much time, labor and money were wasted in starting the enterprise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To get the right man to start it right was a problem; but this was finally overcome by the selection of a man who had made a success of it in another part of the state. Then one of the company took charge of it, and the results were marvelous, far beyond their wildest expectations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The land in question was almost worthless, but had two conditions that made it ideal for the growing of the fruit: It had a good supply of water that could be used for irrigation purposes, and it had good drainage, the two essentials for success at the present time. This garden spot of eighty-five or eighty-six acres was put under intense cultivation, nothing being ■pared to make it productive. The very latest methods were employed to get the results, and surely they were extraordinary.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>Large Yield of Cranberries</span></h5>

<p><span class="font5">ROM this acreage in the Fall of 1922 over 12,000 barrels, or 36,000 bushels, or 1,200,-000 quarts, of fine fruit were harvested. You will say: Some yield! Yes; it is the world record for a large area. A larger yield from a email acreage has been witnessed but none on such a large scale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">present</span><span class="font5"> time we have certain conditions that will not permit of such grand results on all land adapted to the growing of cranberries. Our weather conditions interfere. We have the same kind of trouble that they had four thousand years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Genesis 31:40 we have these words portraying the exact conditions that the grower has to contend with in the present age: &quot;Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.” Here is the reason why all lands at the present time cannot be used for this purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is especially so now because the frost would enter in as the chief reason against a complete success. There are thousands of acres of this kind of land that could be used for this purpose but for this one condition, the frost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are many insects with which the grower has to contend; but we are assured that there will come a time when nothing ‘shall hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain [kingdom]? (Isaiah 11:9) When the new conditions are in the earth, during Messiah’s reign, a marked change in all things will be the order. We have at the present time the extremes of heat and cold producing results detrimental to both animal and vegetable life.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark78"></a>Milder Weather Conditions Coming</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5">N GROWING cranberries we have both the early and the late varieties. Observation teaches us that some kinds will keep much longer than others. Some decay very rapidly, while others keep many months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This brings us to another thought: What will the weather conditions be in the coming age! Will it be warm, something of a hothouse condition; or will it be cold! I am inclined to believe that it will be neither hot nor cold but will be near the 45° mark. I understand that vegetation grows at about 45°.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have noticed that the late-keeping fruit grows slowly, takes a long time to mature, hence is a better quality for keeping. In speaking of the new order of things (the new kingdom) we find these words: “In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations ” These words seem to be used both literally and symbolically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We would not suppose for a moment that there would grow on a tree fruit that would blossom and develop into mature or ripe fruit </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&amp;n </span><span class="font5">in thirty days. But would it not be more reasonable to think that on the same tree might be the blossoms, the smaU fruit, the larger, and then the ripe or mature fruit, afi at the same time, similar to the Everbearing strawberry or raspberry; and that the weather conditions would be such that there would be these conditions throughout the year!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Does it not seem reasonable to infer that the perfect fruit would require an atmosphere that would make the fruit hardy, thereby putting it in a condition that would allow for long keeping! Would not a hot or a very warm condition tend to grow fruit or vegetation so that its life would be very short! The Genesis account </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">creation seems to confirm this last thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the earth is perfect, with its perfect Atmosphere, you can see how much of this land </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">that is now </span><span class="font5">waste can be made to blossom as the rose and produce most abundantly. No insects would be there to destroy the fruit, no frosts to keep the laborer awake at night, no drought to consume away. These are the conditions that are promised. Read pages 82 to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">96 </span><span class="font5">in “The Finished Mystery&quot;' for proof of this by the twenty-four prophets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">More and more do we see the value of fruits of all kinds. As a health preserver, there is nothing better. Fruit contains many of the elements, if not all, to keep the system in perfect order. When we behold the first man as he was placed in the garden of Eden, with perfect surroundings and a perfect food to sustain life, we can realize to some extent the important part that the future conditions will have on man when the Lord will lay down His rule as to how to eat and what to eat.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>Cranberries Healthful Food</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">THE doctors have lately discovered </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">something new. They don’t know just what it is. They call it Vitamines. Here is the late dictionary definition of it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Vitamines, A newly discovered group of substances the nature of which is not yet fully determined, that are found in largest amounts in milk, butter fat, codliver oil, yeast, fresh fruit, and vegetables whose edible parts are essential to the welfare of the body.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In other words, vitamines are the mineral salts found in all fruits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Cranberries contain many of the elements which assist in keeping the system in good condition. Especially is this so where acid is required in digesting the food. Cranberries are not only used very extensively as food, but are also used in a medical way. They are one of the very best remedies for erysipelas or infectious skin diseases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only will this waste land be made to produce cranberries abundantly, but we can see signs of other kinds of waste land made to grow other fruit, such as blueberries, very profusely.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark81"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark82"></a>Poor Soil Yields Blueberries</span></h5>
<div><img src="g_E_19231024_files/g_E_19231024-17.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:17pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">Y SELECTION, the blueberry plant </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font5">coming into prominence on land that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font5">considered worthless. I quote from an advertisement in one of our Eastern papers showing the possibilities of this fruit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>&lt;f</sup>Whitebog blueberries are a new addition to the cultivated group, and open a new and profitable field to the cranberry grower. They are nearly as large as grapes, practically seedless, and have a distinctively delicious flavor. The market demand is greater than the supply. From our own commercial blueberry plantation in 1922 our returns were $10,000 from sixteen acres, only a portion of which was in full bearing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I am told by one who has been over </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">this </span><span class="font5">plantation that while the soil is the very </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">poor</span><span class="font5">est of sand, yet the plants were very thrifty and healthy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I am sure that the Lord will not use all waste land for fruit. I am inclined to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">think</span><span class="font5"> that some of the more wet or lake-like conditions will </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font5">utilized for something else. I refer to the wonderful flower beds found in just such barren places, now too wet for other things to grow on. We have near us one of those wonderful </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Lotus </span><span class="font5">beds. It is a little beauty-spot out in the waste land, a sight worth going a long way to Bee, especially when in bloom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font5">comparatively young Indian who has lived nearly all his life near this place says that he can well remember when there were but a few bunches near the edge of the water. But now it has spread over quite a large area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These are a few of the things that will help make the old earth good to behold. The Lord says that His footstool (the earth) shall be made glorious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The question may be asked: How will the earth be made glorious and beautiful! Will it be in a miraculous manner! It would seem not. The injunction given to Adam no doubt indicates the method to be employed. In addition to the earth and the atmosphere, man was given the command to fill the earth and subdue it I </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">am </span><span class="font5">sure that the Lord will have no drones </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font5">idle people to cumber the earth when His kingdom is fully set up, but that each person will find the niche for which he is fitted and gladly will he fill it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then will the words of the Revelator </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">be fulfilled: &quot;And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">earth </span><span class="font5">were passed away.” (Revelation 21:1) </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">This, of </span><span class="font5">course, refers to the spiritual and physical control of our earth, and not to the passing away of the planet and the coming of a new planet. It is this planet that is to be made glorious and to become Eden-like, world-wide.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">W</span><span class="font5">ONDERFUL God, wonderful Creator, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">let </span><span class="font5">me think awhile of Thee. Mere man </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">can </span><span class="font5">but vaguely understand Thy wondrous </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">works. </span><span class="font5">We see the little flower growing there </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">on a </span><span class="font5">lonely spot, even where man has never trod, given life and living, as God intended; and it looks up as if to thank God for the privilege given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yea, even this world is as a blade of grass with countless numbers. We behold stretched out in the heavens of unthinkable space twinkling stars like little specks of light; so great is the distance that we marvel at the immensity of it.

<p><span class="font5">When compared with the ever-unfolding works of God, man is but an atom of wisdom; nay, he is not even that if he does not acknowledge his Creator.

<p><span class="font5">But wait! What unseen force has shaped those bones to grow into a definite plan—why not some other form or size! By chance it cannot be, and surely not the work of man! So think, I say again, and </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">think</span><span class="font5"> deeply. Seek and' ye shall find God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">O ONE who sincerely believes and follows the teachings of the Holy Scriptures, through and by the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, this sudden flood of criti</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">cism of </span><span class="font5">the Word of God by professing Christians, especially those professing to be leaders </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">teachers of Holy Writ, is significant^</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What this all means is foretold by our Lord. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font5">declared that in the latter days there would </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">arise </span><span class="font5">false Christs and false prophets; and that if it were possible they would deceive the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">very </span><span class="font5">elect But, thank God! this is not possible. —Matthew 24: 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The topics for sermons, and the various newspaper articles constantly appearing, indicate that our modern pulpiteers have exhausted the spiritual riches of the only Book on earth given to man for his instruction.—2 Timothy 3:13-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Has the Bible no more lessons for usf .Is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">Bible out of date! Mr. Wells contends that we need a new and simplified Bible; but these higher critics fail to reveal their sagacity and ability to devise another one. Those who believe </span><span class="font5">that the Bible is out of date and not of divine inspiration are in the false Christ and false prophet class, whose faith is in their own works and not in God's. One cause for this condition is pride and a desire for popularity, one of the most debasing things on earth, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">prominent characteristic of the devil. The opinion of some preachers is that the people should be fed with novelty, pleasure, and entertainment. Their churches must bulge and groan with thronging thousands, the hungry mass merely to hear some sweet story—perhaps not pertaining to the Word of God at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">St. Paul told the Corinthians that he had determined not to know anything among them </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">save </span><span class="font5">Jesus Christ and Him crucified. (1 Corinthians 2:2) But most preachers seem to know everything else under the sun except Christ and Him crucified. It is by Christ's spirit that we make progress (Romans 8:9); and there is no other method by which humanity may be saved; surely not by novelty, pleasure </span><span class="font5">and entertainment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our Lord said: &quot;And </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I, if I </span><span class="font5">be lifted up . . . will draw all men unto me” (John 12:32) This drawing is through and by His word as contained in the Holy Scriptures (1 Peter 1: 23; John 6: 63), and not in &quot;science falsely so called,&quot; so often put forward in these days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">None can know more about the plan of God than He has revealed in His Word. It was given for the meek and lowly of heart (James 4:6), and is progressively shining more and more unto the perfect day. (Proverbs 4:18) Our Lord says: &quot;Seek, and ye shall find.'* (Matthew 7:7) Without the revelation of God's plan as contained in the Bible men would be able to arrive at very indefinite conclusions respecting man's future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bible has been misused as a fiddle upon which to play any tune men chose; whence have come the hundreds of different denominations. But, thank God, they are playing their last tunes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Selfishness and ignorance are the causes of all the present unrest in the world; and a Bible in the pocket and a gun on the shoulder are not a good combination to remedy the present evils. The world is vainly endeavoring to bring order out of chaos and to reform the people through their own efforts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">RUTH is the only thing of real value and the Word of God alone is able to supply that truth. The inspired Word will never lose its supremacy. God says: &quot;My word . . . shall not return unto me void.&quot; (Isaiah 55:11) &quot;I will be exalted in the earth.” (Psalm 46:10) The Lord’s kingdom is the only key to the &quot;new order&quot;; and wise is he who puts his trust therein; for out of it shall come all the divine blessings promised in the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah tells us that the knowledge of the Lord shall cover the earth as the waters cover the deep. (Habakkuk 2:14) The fact that the knowledge of the Lord does not yet cover the earth, and that the people have not yet been converted, is proof of the failure of the religious denominations. They have had over 1,800 years of trial; and the world today is farther from a knowledge of the Lord and farther from being converted than at any time since the days of Christ and the apostles. All faith should be built upon the Word of God, and not upon man’s word.—Hosea 4:1-6; Isaiah 5:13; Jeremiah 17:5; Proverbs 3:5-7; Matthew 15:9-</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">S</span><span class="font5">IN (outside of the original sin of Adam) has been profusely advertised, and it has the advantage of being something that most people •want; for the desire for sinful things has been enticingly portrayed by word and picture. Goodness, love, mercy, peace, justice, liberty and happiness (true Godliness), as taught in the Word of God, were set forth centuries ago. Ministers, priests and rabbis have been the salesmen; but a good many of them need to be instructed as to the value of their wares. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They tell us in lurid word pictures what will happen to us if we are not good. They paint hell in all its horribleness. They dwell on our earthly sins in all their fascinating detail; that is one reason why there are empty pews and empty hearts. That is why religion as taught by some ministers, priests and rabbis today is something a man carries in his pocket and takes a swallow of when occasion may prompt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These men are selling something that is not conducive to righteousness nor in harmony with the expressed will of God. They are &quot;putting over” the kind of “goodness” that is found in the creeds of fallible and erring men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is easy to have people sing hymns, but it is quite difficult to make them feel, down in their very souls, the meaning of those hymns. That is where most preachers come short.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Word of God is needed, and true followers of that Word are needed to explain its meaning and put into every human heart love for his fellow man, and a real desire to be of service to others and brighten their lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What humanity needs, what the world is famishing for, what civilization itself must have, is not teachers who claim to prove that our ancestors were monkeys, but men used of God as instruments to bear the message of truth, enlightening and blessing the poor, groaning creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then the message of these men of God will point the way to brotherhood and true brotherly love, and life, liberty and happiness—the desire of all nations. (Haggai 2:7) Christ’s kingdom upon earth will supply such a need. Thus will Jehovah’s will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark87"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark88"></a>Worldly Wisdom from Beneath</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE apostle Paul tells us that He who redeemed us gives us wisdom. (1 Corinthians 1:30) How, then, does a true Christian get </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font5">wisdom pertaining to spiritual things? </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font5">Bible is the only book which supplies that wisdom; and God’s holy spirit operates through it upon the minds of those who put their trust in Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hence we know that the Bible is true; for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font5">brings peace and joy and consolation to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">those </span><span class="font5">who follow its teachings, and every subject </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font5">harmonized when we learn to “rightly </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">divide </span><span class="font5">the word of truth” (2 Timothy 2:15), and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">use reason. (Isaiah 1:18) Therein is found </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">most wonderful plan for the salvation of all who are willing to obey the righteous law of love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whence do the wise (?) theologians, who deny and contradict the Word of God, receive their wisdom? From man; for it is a common failing for men to believe certain doctrines because others thus believed in whom they had confidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">John D. Rockefeller gives a recipe for living one hundred years. Among other things </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font5">says: “Live a Christian life, play golf, and always keep plenty of money on hand.” Thus golf, and the possession of plenty of money seem to be parts of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">Christian life. That </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">may </span><span class="font5">be all right for John D. and a few others; but how about the many millions of people on earth who are unable to play golf and to keep plenty of money on hand? They surely will have </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">die. Poor souls. Seemingly they have no business being poor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rev. Alfred W. Wishart in an article in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Free Press</span><span class="font5"> says that the Bible is based upon facts and not faith and is not infallible. From this it is quite evident that his theory is based upon neither fact nor faith. The theory of evolution is not taught in the Word of God, but </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font5">merely an hypothesis which has tripped many a clergyman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another Reverend D. D. says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“I have been for fifty years a minister in the church* I entered the ministry with enthusiasm, believing as I did that the church was the one organization in ths world of divine institution, that it owes its origin to Jesus Christ, and that He was the unique Son of God. I have been reluctantly led to the conclusion that dodo of these things are true.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is very evident to a true Christian that this Reverend D. D. is referring to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">churchianity </span><span class="font5">and not to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Christianity;</span><span class="font5"> for the former originated with the devil, but the latter with Jehovah God through Jesus Christ our Lord. It has been a common mistake for professing Christian people to get the two mixed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another very wise man, in his own conceit, says that &quot;the wages of sin and crime always are social ruin and spiritual death, and the reward of righteousness is self-esteem, social respect, and a genuine success immeasurable in terms of money.” Thus we have another one of the many wise men whose religion is measured in terms of money. And is it any wonder; for did not the Interchurch World Movement say in one of their advertisements: &quot;The money test is primary to a one hundred percent Christianity”! They ignore the Word of God. See Proverbs 28:11; James 2:5; Luke 18:18-25; James 4:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Further, I ask, if one’s spirit dies, and after a few short years his body dies, what then is left of him? The Bible answers: Nothing is left. Man says: The soul is left; but the Word of God says that &quot;the soul that sinneth, it shall die.&quot;—Ezekiel 18:4,20; Acts 3:23; Romans 6: 23; Matthew 10:28. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let us be careful how we treat this Holy Book, knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scriptures is of any private issuance and that if any man shall add unto or take away from the prophecy of this Book, God will deal with him as it is written in Revelation 22:18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How true are the words of God through the Prophet when He says: &quot;I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this peopfe, even a marvelous work and a wonder; for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.”— Isaiah 29:14 (see vs. 13,15).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When these parasites, who sap the very lifeblood of the nations, are removed, the terrible burden which has been carried by the poor people of earth for centuries, will be rolled away. Then will the true Light (John 1:9) shine upon and for all. Then will the children of men begin to survey that wonderful cross and drink water out of the wells of salvation. (Isaiah 12:3) Then, and only then, will peace on earth, good will toward men, be a reality and not a hollow mockery!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why will not men cease following the theories and fallacies of the would-be reformers </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">turn prayerfully and sincerely to the study of the Word of God, which is the only remedy for the ills of mankind!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Man's endeavor to rule has been </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">failure, and has been admitted so by some of the leaders, and will.be admitted so by all reasonable men if they will even casually examine the present conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If anyone thinks that it is safer to offend God than man, and that it is better to retain the favor of the bright minds of the world than to continue in the favor of his Lord and Head, Jesus Christ, then such would not profit much by a study of the Word of God. Hence this is one of the distinguishing points between a true Christian and a mere professor of religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While we may look for His leading through human agencies, our trust is not in them, not in man’s wisdom and strength, but in the Lord’s wisdom and strength obtained through His Word, if the mind be rightly applied to its teachings; .&quot;for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.”— 1 Samuel 16:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Money is not God; neither is might, nor earthly wisdom; but Jehovah is the only true God and Jesus Christ is the King of kings and Lord of lords. His now-dawning kingdom is the only remedy for the ills of humankind today. It will bring peace and lasting blessing to mankind—what Christians have been praying for: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven,”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark89"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark90"></a>Love, Not Force</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HERE is an infinite satisfaction in receiving the gifts of God. But the privilege of becoming the means through which He will bestow light and blessing upon others is the greatest privilege bestowed upon man, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">if </span><span class="font5">man’s way of thinking and acting is wrong, to correct it by helping him to get more light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Envy not the oppressor, and choose none </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">his ways. Labor not for the sake of &quot;ism&quot; </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font5">creed, but for humanity's sake. Use truth for authority and not authority for truth. Christ's kingdom upon earth comes not by stress of law </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font5">force of arms. Men are attracted by </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">power of love; they cannot be driven toward the driver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In an article in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Literary Digest</span><span class="font5"> the Baptists of Georgia are reported as trying to enforce the Golden Rule by dismissing from the church those who fail to observe it in conducting their business and by performing proper labor. It would be a very good thing if all denominations were to try that scheme. Then the preachers should soon have to go to work like other men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When force is introduced into any sacred work, at that moment it loses its sacredness and is no longer the work of God, but of the devil. The truth of religion is never represented by force nor fostered by it Men with true religion in their hearts will follow the Golden Rule in business, politics and in every walk of life. When men have the truth, as contained in the Word of God, the churches will have honest business and stay out of politics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No religious teaching should have any weight except it is supported by the Word of God; for one plan, one spirit, and one purpose pervade the whole Book. Some one says: &quot;I cannot understand the Bible.” The understanding of the Bible can be obtained only by sincerely and prayerfully applying the mind to that purpose in a childlike</span><span class="font5">e attitude essential to faith in God through Christ Jesus. (1 Peter 5:6) Make a complete surrender of the human will to the divine will “Seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.”—Matthew 7:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Education, while beneficial in certain ways, is of no avail in the understanding of the Word of God; for God only is able to make wise unto salvation through faith in Christ Jesus (2 Timothy 3:15) and give a proper understanding pertaining to spiritual things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The sooner the world comes to realize the fact that none can know more about the plan of God than He has revealed in His Word, the sooner they will cast their cares upon the Lord and not upon man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why do not people judge what is right 1 The signs of the time of trouble are many; but men refuse to read them. As our Lord says, “As the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.” (Matthew 24:37) But the time has come for people to understand, and the Lord will make it plain to all those who seek to know the truth.</span></p>

It is beyond the limitation of the mental powers of any one at this time to grasp the concept of a perfect man, such as were Adam, before his deflection, and Jesus. But this will be common knowledge to all when humanity are restored to perfection, during the reign of Messiah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the Savior of men awakens from death the human race; when this awakened people register in the school of Christ, and obey inviolate the mandates of that holy institution; when they have finished their course of instructions, and received their diplomas of graduation— the right to eternal life; when they, thus restored, comprehend the real plan of Jehovah in restoring His “image” on earth, and enter into cooperation with Him in continuing that plan throughout the “ages to come”—then shall the “imagination of man remain within the bounds of established facts ”</span></p>

(lift “The Harp of God&quot;, with accompanying questions, taking the place of both yyb Advanced and Juvenile bible Studies which have been hitherto published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“’Looking back, then, at the picture that Jehovah made by the use of the Jewish people and their ceremonies, we see that the bullock slain on the atonement day pictured Jesus the perfect man at the age of thirty years. The court surrounding the tabernacle was a picture of perfect humanity. Therefore the bullock slain in the court foreshadowed or pictured the fact that the perfect man Jesus died in that condition on earth as a perfect man. By His death He provided the ransom-price. He did this to carry out the Father’s plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>234.</sup>In the picture, the slaying of the bullock was the beginning of the sin-offering. After the bullock was slain, its blood was put into a vessel; and the high priest carried it in this vessel, ultimately reaching the Most Holy, where it was sprinkled, as before mentioned. The high priest in the Holy pictured Jesus during the three and one-half years of His sacrificial ministry; and the high priest’s appearance in the Most Holy pictures Jesus the high priest, resurrected to the divine nature, appearing in heaven itself in the presence of God, there to present the merit of His sacrifice as the sin-offering on behalf of mankind.— Hebrews 9:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>235</sup>The Scriptures clearly show that Jesus was the antitypical bullock and was made an offering for sin on behalf of mankind; first on behalf of the church, subsequently on behalf of the whole world. “Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures” (1 Corinthians 15:3); “who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father” (Galatians 1:4); “for he hath made him to be sin [an offering for sin] for us, who [Jesus] knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”—2 Corinthians 5: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>236.</sup>The law that God gave to the Israelites merely foreshadowed what great things Jesus would do. Because of the imperfections of mankind—Moses and others—that law could not accomplish the deliverance of mankind from death. “For what the law could not do, in that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font5">was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font5">sin, condemned sin in the flesh.”—Romans </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">”<sup>T</sup>In the type, the slaying of the bullock </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">the carrying of its blood into the Holy </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as a </span><span class="font5">typical sin-offering foreshadowed the fact </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font5">the redemption for mani sin could be accomplished only through the blood of the perfect sacrifice. And for this reason says the apostle Paul: “Without the shedding of blood is no remission. It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font5">purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.” (Hebrews 9:22,23) The patterns here referred to are the Holy and Most Holy in the tabernacle picture, which foreshadowed or pictured the heavenly condition; and the entrance of the high priest into the Most Holy of the tabernacle with the blood foreshadowed Christ Jesus </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">en</span><span class="font5">tering heaven. “For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">us.”— </span><span class="font5">Hebrews 9:24.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark94"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark95"></a>Seeing Through and Beyond Today</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Theories and opinions advanced by responsible men of today influence and guide people’s thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Their viewpoint is largely in the particular field of their interest. Sometimes it is related to other fields, but generally individualistic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seldom such general sources of information view events other than as reports of events already transpired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The viewpoint of advantage, however, sees the cause, notes the effect, and understands perfectly the result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But such a vision is to be had only from the prophecies of the Bible; for they alone foretell events with certainty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Studies in the Scriptures</span><span class="font5"> deal with prophecies being fulfilled in our day. The topical arrangement permits the consideration of political crises, unrest, and explains their significance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Indexed verse by verse, the reader has an explanation of most prophetic statements and knows what influence events of today have on the future—a knowledge of no uncertain advantage.</span></p>
