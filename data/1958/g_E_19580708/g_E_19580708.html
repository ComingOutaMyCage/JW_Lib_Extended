<p><span class="font31" style="font-style:italic;">N</span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">O</span><span class="font20"> ONE wants to spend his life suffering from a sickness or a physical disability; yet multitudes are. Hospitals are filled with them. They spend their lives with the gnawing desire to be healed, and they watch with envy those who come, stay a short while and then leave. But they must stay on because modern medicine cannot cure them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The person who suffers from a momentary affliction has the hope of recovering, but what hope can the person have who cannot be healed? In spite of a bleak existence on a hospital bed or in a wheel chair, perhaps not even being able to move a limb, there is still reason for him to hope. He can look forward with confidence to being completely healed even though modem science can do nothing for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">His healing will come from God, not through so-called faith healers, but through God’s kingdom. The One who has been enthroned as King in that kingdom has the power to heal the sick and will use it as soon as the appointed time arrives for him to take over complete control of earth. He demonstrated his power to heal when he was on earth nearly 2,000 years ago. When Christ healed the deaf, the blind and the paralyzed at that time he demonstrated what he would do during the reign of his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">As a divine physician Christ will use his healing powers to bring health to</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">obedient mankind. What is described by these words will then literally take place: “Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing.” “And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be any more. The former things have passed away.”—Isa. 35:5, 6, AS; Rev. 21:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Here is hope for those who now suffer. They need not despair. By enduring in faith they will experience the healing that is promised to come through God’s kingdom. Let those who suffer look to the future with renewed interest and hope. Let them do as Christ commands the faithful: “Lift your heads up, because your deliverance is getting near.”—Luke 21:28.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>

<p><span class="font20">EE! HEAR!” says an advertisement for a revival telecast. “Actual miracles happening before your eyes. Cancer, tumors, goiters disappear. Crutches, braces, wheelchairs, stretchers discarded. Crossed eyes straightened. Caught by the camera as they occurred in the healing line before thousands of witnesses.” Another ad of a Los Angeles “faith healer” reads: ‘Miracles of Healing Now in Progress Nightly.’ This miracle maker gives away cash prizes to his most devoted followers and “miracle </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">oil&quot; to those </span><span class="font20">generous with “love offerings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">A “soul saver” in Houston, Texas, promises through Jesus to heal those afflicted with “every known disease, and many unknown except to Jesus.” In the hills of Virginia a cult known as &quot;Holiness Faith Healers” fondle venomous snakes and boast that every kind </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font20"> ailment can be cured by prayer and anointing oil. In Athens, Greece, people are flocking to the side of Alexandra Magoulas, a fifty-three-year-old widow who claims to be endowed with remarkable healing powers. France reportedly “now has more specialists in miracles than it has doctors.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Both Roman Catholic and Protestant religions are in the healing business. Shrines in Lourdes, France, and St. Anne de Beaupre and St. Joseph’s Oratory in Montreal, Canada, are but few of many Roman Catholic places where miraculous cures are claimed. The phenomena, however, “which the Catholic Church officially certifies as miracles are relatively few.”</span></p><img src="g_E_19580708_files/g_E_19580708-4.png" alt="" style="width:201pt;height:226pt;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">do their '&quot;healing campaigns&quot; mecture up when com' pared with the miraculous cures of the first century?</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Some major Protestant religions are just coming around to accept the idea of faith healing, although generally the major Protestant religions maintain that miracles of the first century were “intended to authenticate the credentials of the Apostles as God’s agents in the founding of Christianity,” says an authority. “With the passing of the last Apostle, when the Christian Church had been securely established, the need for miracles no longer existed and they ceased.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Examining the Record</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Despite the discrepancies and doubts being voiced as to the validity of faith cures, there are more “unearthly marvels” said to be taking place inside revival </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">tents today </span><span class="font20">than at any time in history. Are these claims true? Are the cures of today genuine credentials of Christianity? How do today’s cures compare with those of Bible times? Are those “healed” really healed? Is this the power of God at work in the hands of “healers,” or is it a trick?</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Most of the valid criticism directed against “faith healers” today usually has to do with their failure to provide any record or documentation for their healings. There is no way of proving what is often claimed. And, too, in hundreds of cases, &quot;faith healers” admit they fail to heal, whereas Jesus, never failed. Why, then, the failures if the healing is performed by the power of the same God? John Kobler, in his article “The Truth About Faith Healers,” says “faith healer” Jack Coe was denounced by the Miami Council of Churches “as a religious quack.” He further says: “Three ministers of the Churches of Christ, a Protestant sect which maintains a standing offer of $1,000 to Oral Roberts [another “faith healer”] for proof of a single cure acceptable to a committee of three doctors, issued the same challenge to Coe, raising the purse to $2,500. Like Roberts, he ignored it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">If the “cures” performed are genuine, permanent and complete, why not have doctors and people examine them? Why refuse an opportunity to glorify God and prove Him true? Why let the presence of doubters, scoffers and persecutors prevent the marvelous works of God? Did not Jesus do some of his most remarkable healings in the presence of his avowed enemies? Before his accusers he healed a man with a withered hand. In the presence of his persecutors he healed the high priest's slave’s ear after it had been cut off. After • healing a leprous man, did not Jesus say to him: “Go, show yourself to the priest”? Jesus was not backward about having his cures examined or inspected. £nd no one ever doubted the permanency and soundness of his cures either—no, not even his enemies. His works were done in the open, where skeptics and scoffers could see them, so that none would have cause to deny that he was the Christ.—Matt. 8:3, 4; 12: 10; Luke 22:50,51; 17:11-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">But there are many valid reasons why one would doubt the powers of present-day “healers.” Take, for an example, the case of a small-town twelve-year-old girl who was crippled from infancy. Since everyone in town knew Mary there was no chance for a fake. A woman evangelist said she could heal Mary. Before a gathered multitude the evangelist fixed her eyes on the child and said: “Mary, drop your crutches and come to me!” Mary dropped her crutches and walked. The crowd gasped. There was no doubt in their mind that they had witnessed a miracle performed before their very eyes. Three days later, when the emotion had worn off, Mary collapsed on the street and had to be carried home. That was the end to that “miracle.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">For another example, take the case of three-year-old George Clark, Jr., of Hialeah, Florida, who had been stricken with infantile paralysis. His mother took him to “faith healer” Jack Coe. Jack prayed over the boy, then ordered the mother to remove the child’s braces. Coe then cried out with a loud voice: “Lord, I command Thee to heal this child.” Young Clark stood for a moment without his braces and then collapsed to the floor. Coe shouted to Mrs. Clark: “Sister, don’t you put those braces back on that child. Walk him every day. He is healed.” But young Clark was not healed. Despite the suffering and agony of the child, Mrs. Clark for three days did what Coe had commanded her. But it was obvious that her son's legs were getting worse. Mrs. Clark then called her doctor and told him what she had done. She later had Coe brought to court, charging that he was practicing medicine without a license. But Coe was acquitted. Not long after this, Coe himself was struck down by infantile paralysis and died from bulbar polio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Cures and Their Soundness</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Compare these experiences and many others with what Jesus and his apostles accomplished and you cannot help but become righteously indignant at what men today call &quot;cures” and “faith healing.” Near the Sea of Galilee the lame, crippled, blind, dumb, and many otherwise, were virtually thrown at Jesus’ feet, “and he cured them; so that the crowd felt amazement as they saw the dumb </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">speaking</span><span class="font20"> and the lame walking and the blind seeing, and they glorified the God of Israel.” You do not see this happening today.—Matt. 15: 29-31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The cure Jesus performed at the pool of Bethzatha was breath-taking. Jesus did not ask the man about his faith, or to what extent he believed he would be healed. He merely asked the man: “Do you want to become sound in health?” The man said he did, Jesus said to him: “ ‘Get up, pick up your cot and walk.’ With that the'man immediately became sound in health, and he picked up his cot and began to walk.” The man did not even know who Jesus was. It was some time later that he found out that it was Jesus that healed him.—John 5:1-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">But “healers” today constantly harp on the need for believing and having faith. “Sister, do you believe the Lord can heal you?” asked the preacher. “I do,” said the woman. “Then throw away </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">those crutches, </span><span class="font20">rise and walk.” When she could not rise, though struggling earnestly, the preacher shouted: “You’re not believin’, sister. Yo faith is weak. If yo believin’, yo can walk.” But she was believing; still she could not walk. There were no such terrible disappointments or demonstrations in Jesus’ day. Even those that came to the apostles “would one and all be cured.”—Acts 5: 15,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Additionally, such healing as the apostles performed was not for believers themselves. This miraculous power they had was not to be used for their personal convenience or for the relief of devoted Christians in the congregation. Epaphroditus was sick to the point of death. Paul left Trophimus at Miletus sick. Timothy suffered from stomach disorders. But there is not the trace of a suggestion in the Bible to show that Paul performed divine healing on any one of them, even though they were close associates of his. Still Paul, when on the island of Malta, healed many unbelievers. He healed a man who was afflicted with fever and dysentery. “After this occurred, the rest of the people on the island who had sicknesses also began to come to him and be cured.” None of these were Christians. They were a </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">superstitious people. Yet Paul</span><span class="font20"> generously healed them, turning none aside because of their lack of faith.—Acts 28:7-9; Phil. 2:25-30; 2 Tim. 4:20; 1 Tim. 5:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">No Compassion for the Sick</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">How different were the apostles and Jesus from today’s “faith healers,” who show little or no compassion for the sick! “Faith healer” A. A. Allen first works his audience up into a frenzy by his shouting and preaching. “How many believe God is going to work miracles tonight?” he rasps. Thousands raise their hands in approval. “Well, I know he is,” says Allen, “and 1 want every man here to pull out a $20 bill and bring it to this platform. If you haven’t got a $20, then bring a $10. And I know everybody has at least $5 they can give to Jesus.” Members of his staff then run up and down the aisles with buckets collecting the money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">An observer writes: “Allen’s services last an average of four hours each, but he usually spends only about 30 minutes on the ‘healing,’ the rest taken up by preaching, advertising his products and money pitches. Several nights I was there, he did not even get to the ‘healing,’ Night after night you see the same tragic faces and crippled bodies waiting with child-like faith to touch this man. I did not see any miracles under Allen’s tent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Presbyterian pastor Carroll Stegall, Jr., said: “I have never seen a vestige of [physical] change” in the “cures” performed today. And he added: “No healer will come near any really crippled or disabled person if he can possibly avoid it. He will say, ‘Wait until the line is over and I will give you special attention.’ These promises are never kept.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Kobler says: “Without exception American faith healers have so far refused to submit a single case to medical examination. Of the few testimonials which I myself was able to follow up, I found that a supposedly healed diabetic had never been diagnosed; that a victim of cancer, before joining the healing line, had undergone surgery with a prognosis of complete recovery; that a stammerer, said to have had a cleft palate, was actually a hysteric with no organic defect who, moreover, reverted to stammering after his cure.” In addition, this authority tells of an eighteen-month survey made by the Church of England, after which they reported: “We have seen no evidence that there is any special type of illness cured by ‘spiritual healing’ alone which could not have been cured by medical treatment.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">“Received Free, Give Free”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">After summoning his twelve apostles and giving them authority “over unclean spirits, in order to expel these and to cure every kind of disease and every kind of ailment,” Jesus said: “You received free, give free.” How do present-day “healers” measure up to these words? Well, they do not. According to Kobler, “Coe earned $12,000 a year in salary and whatever remained of the ‘love offerings’ after campaign expenses, roughly another $12,000. Shortly before his death he purchased $18,500 worth of Texas real estate. Roberts receives an annual allotment, known as a ‘discretionary fund,* of $25,000 and out of each healing campaign he retains one evening’s donations, which may run as high as $30,000 a year. From book royalties he has grossed more than $80,000. He owns a 280-acre ranch, where he raises purebred Angus cattle. Jaggers, who once told an associate that a preacher should look prosperous and that he never paid less than $40 for a shirt, is also a ranch owner.” He was once detained for two hours to establish legal ownership to some cash he had with him. The measly sum came to $70,000! How unlike Jesus, who had “nowhere to lay down his head.” And certainly not like Peter, who said: “Silver and gold I do not possess.”—Matt. 10:1-9; 8:20; Acts 3: 1-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">So we ask: Do today’s “faith healers” measure up to Scriptural standards? In every way they fall short. They fall short as preachers and they fall short as “healers.” They more readily fit Paul’s description of &quot;deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ. . . . But their end shall be according to their works.”—2 Cor. 11:13-15.</span></p>

It was something like the feeling of the hunter who had been held out of the woods as the season draws to a close and finally is given a few fleeting hours to go out and find himself some big game.

E, Hett writes: “The impulses of shock, worry, hatred, anger, jealousy, revenge and ill-will put extra pressure upon the endocrine glands. Through these the functions of the stomach and intestines are inhibited. Poisons are created which do damage to the tissues. These, in turn, interfere with the proper activity of the mind. It becomes a vicious circle. . . .If, on the other hand, love, cheerfulness, gentleness, charity, hope, sympathy, and tenderness produce harmonious thoughts, such thoughts will create health, contentment, and the sunshine of a radiant spirit.

<p><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">DO YOU THINK ,</span></p><img src="g_E_19580708_files/g_E_19580708-5.png" alt="" style="width:334pt;height:369pt;">
<p><span class="font26" style="font-variant:small-caps;">iJt HAS been said that people fall into two groups—those who think for them’ selves and those who do not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">From among those who do some of their own thinking we see a new class growing all around us. This phenomenon takes shape in a rather new way, socially speaking. Classes of society have long been relegated to their strata by economic, political or historical prestige. In the ‘New Class,’ arrival is come by as a result of emphasis on two things we all share in common— mind and ego. Everything in this set revolves around self-effusion. Its members have one desire in common—to be accepted as thinkers, as intellectuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Don’t cdnfuse this new class or its adherents with the real intellectual, however. While every one of us possesses intelligence, in varying degrees, the true intellectual has understanding or mental capacity to a high degree. His enlightened judgment or opinion may cover any special field or many fields. Such a one has intense interest in his subject or subjects, as a student who keeps reaching ahead for greater knowledge. Unfortunately the word “egghead” has been used to describe him and set him apart. Unfortunate, because it carries a mockery of the legitimate use of intelligence, and most often by those whose way of life has been im-proved by “eggheads.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">J Because of the increase of pseudo-<sub>B</sub> intellectualism there is felt an increasing need to clarify the difference between the real and the simulated. The difference between the two is like the difference between lightning and the lightning bug. But it is not always so easily distinguishable to the untrained observer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">The pseudo-intellectual of the New Class never comes up to the rank he feels he is in. He creates a small world of his own, the better to lift him above those he would like to feel are his inferiors. Perhaps one thing that led to this development was the kind of prosperity in some countries that resulted in the greater influx of students in colleges and universities. Time was when only the wealthy, who could easily afford advanced education, and the persons who really had superior mental capacity plus the fortitude to endure the struggle for it, ended up on the enrollment register of schools of higher learning. With better times, more persons of average (or less than) intelligence hiked off to college because they could, and the prestige that came with it entertained their ego, as well as delayed the process of becoming selfdependent. As this group grew, so also did the New Class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Once persons of this group are thrown out into the world outside the classroom, into an atmosphere that proves their real caliber to be less than they had envisioned,</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font20">clique movement starts. Though the world does not take kindly to their “genius,” this does not shake them into realism. Instead, their dour ‘world is not worthy of me* attitude carries them to the side of fellow companions of misery, who supply each other with lift, the reassurance that they are someone bigger, better and above it all. This head-in-the-clouds feeling must be maintained. And so it is—by talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Deliberately Different</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Since the New Classer has not attained any position in the world of real intellectuals, his ego cries for something to set him apart from the normal. Therefore the intentional effort to look, act and live different. But especially does he talk differently. The talk takes a pattern that is recognized by other pseudos and may sound, by its jargon, esoteric to Mr. Joe Average. It is not so much that it is intended only for the initiated New Classer as that by its form it is intended to impress. Its very pattern gives it away. The range of subjects is somewhat apart from that of the population majority—arts, music, literature—and in which he may even be an </span><span class="font20" style="text-decoration:underline;">inf</span><span class="font20">ormed talker. However, his special cup of tea is the psyche.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The study of psychology and the Freudian technique of psychoanalysis has become popular. It is by no means limited to persons intending to pursue that branch of study for professional use. The search of the mind, or psyche, and its relationship to human behavior, conflicts and tensions has attracted a great number of the curious. Books have made it available to any who want the latest finding in the still new and experimental field of psychoanalysis. This has become the great “mind age.” Don’t misunderstand. Information gained by research in this field has done a great deal of good for many people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">On the other hand, a smattering of knowledge on the subject of human behavior has a particular reaction on a person who wants others to believe he is intellectual. It supplies him with some of his jargon, the talk that sets him apart. If he can glibly discuss complexes, relating, identifying, transference, repression, mind-set, compulsions and on and on, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">ad nauseam,</span><span class="font20"> he positively knows he is superior, both in company of those who knew wtbmg and care less about these things (who manage to lead well-adjusted lives) and because by this “operation big talk” he is one of the New Class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">There is no doubt that enlightened research into the complexities of mental states and processes as such determine action and behavior of people has enabled more persons to understand themselves and others better. While bringing to light the cause of conflicts has a certain value, therein does not lie its greatest help. This lies in the conscious effort of a person with a clear view of his shortcomings to follow a course to correct them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">However, this is not the reason for the pseudo-intellectual’s use of whatever knowledge he has of the subject. For surely if it were, those of the New Class would be sterling examples of what we all should be like. Instead, this person uses this information to assure himself that since he knows why he acts in certain unconventional or sometimes immoral ways he is standing on solid ground. Knowing his shortcomings and why he has them, he feels he can now live with them, even cherish them. There is no sight of an effort toward correction. The buildup of introverted interest through the fad of the psyche-search is to have a convenient vehicle for an exaggerated concern with self. The sham intellectual uses the mind to build, not true wisdom from knowledge, but adornment for his ego.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">There is another group of thinkers. And one of these any of us can be. While it is only a very small percentage of persons who have a gift of natural intelligence or capacity in especially high degree, there is no limit to the number of persons who can belong to this group. An honest person shuns the hypocritical, egotistic role of a pseudo-intellectual. He can quickly come to see that such a person blindfolds his mind to taking in knowledge for the purpose of building wisdom. The display of knowledge, or the gathering of it for that purpose, only puffs one up. No person who appreciates why man was given a brain can be attracted to such a course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">Use </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Instead of Lose Your Mental Powers</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">However, there is an unforgivable lethargy apparent all around us, and perhaps not just around us. It is a willing sluggishness of the use of the mind. Many of us are at times guilty of putting the brakes on our thinking powers. It’s a nice kind of drowsiness, In a lethal sort of way. One’s intellect is never static. There Is either growth or decay. No one can stand still mentally. The excuse that age induces mental stagnation has long been dispelled by actual experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Look upon the brain as a muscle. If you keep an arm In a sling for months, even years, you couldn’t expect it to perform naturally when it is released. It requires exercise to strengthen it, to tone its muscles for use. As it is exercised and used gradually it becomes stronger, until at last it can be fully useful as it was created to be. When the brain gets little or no exercise it too can go flabby. But when it gets constant mental exercise it grows more and more capable of performing as you want it to, in fact more efficiently than you ever thought possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Perhaps the reason age seems to many to dull the ability to learn and remember is that with age persons become set in their routine of life. Life is no longer new to them, as when they were young and the world was constantly opening wider before their eyes. Their keen powers of observation have been allowed to become dulled by the sameness of experiences and surroundings. They have not kept alert to learning new things or looking for the unusual. When they sit down to take in some new information it becomes a real chore. Things seem to come harder. And perhaps they do for a while. But kept up as a practice, learning grows easier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Too many people relax their intellect. If they see a person who can give an answer or talk on a subject with apparent ease and considerable adeptness they marvel and mentally settle back with the thought, “I would love to be able to talk or present my views as well, but I can’t; so that’s that, I won’t try.” And they don’t try. TTiey believe it’s excusable because they feel by trying they will never attain anyway. This kind of thinking is a mortal plague to the mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Keeping the mind agile means keeping alert every waking hour of the day. Retain a childlike curiosity for knowing reasons why. Practice explaining things to yourself as you would have to do to a critical person. An example of alertness and keenness of observation is the native who lives close to nature, whether it be deep in African jungles, South or North American or Australian wildernesses. These natives neither read nor write. They learn by observing; they remember because it may mean their life to remember. Their foes may be animal or man or climate. They have learned that their sharp interest in things around them is what keeps them alive. Civilization has dulled this kind of keenness in many of us. It has taught us to conform, not to question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Persons whose business it is to pursue dangerous activities have learned the importance of alert observation. And from observing, the ability to build up reasonable or logical conclusions. Conclusions that guide them in such a way as to preserve them in the midst of adverse conditions, The man who is a professional big game hunter, or who dives deep into the waters under the earth or flies high above the earth, keeps learning, keeps observing, never stops paying attention to everything around him. His life depends upon it. And this is the way we ought to be mentally. Our life may depend upon staying awake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">When a person chooses a vocation or avocation of teaching, he should constantly progress toward being a better teacher, a better speaker, a better student. This can only be done by applying the mind to reaching out for this kind of growth. If it is to instruct, assume the mental image of a person who must be convinced, who knows nothing about the subject and must be taught in such a simple, true and convincing way that the subject will be understood when it is finished. If it is to speak, speak in such a way as to be understood, to instruct, not to exhaust or to impress the listener. And as a student, learn, assimilate and correlate facts, letting the mind have freedom and exercise in connecting ideas, experiences; to learn reason and logic and to attain to real wisdom. A student keeps young because he is always anxious to learn. A student mind is something all of us can have. But it is something that is had only by practice; and by practice we can all come to experience the wonders and the depths possible to the marvelously formed mind of man.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">An Amazing Chemical</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font31">F</span><span class="font20">EW creatures are as utterly amazing as termites. Their unlikely diet—plain wood—makes them-amazing enough. Their nests are the most remarkable architectural structures found in the insect kingdom. In the way they reproduce they spem to defy the very laws of heredity. And amazing is the word for the chemical warfare soldier termites wage— their glue guns petrify the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Although they are popularly known as “white ants,’’ termites are not really ants nor are they all white. With some 2,000 species in the world there is variety indeed. Most of this variety is found </span><span class="font20" style="text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font20"> the tropics, where termites thrive; but a few manage to make a good living in temperate parts of the earth, as many a householder in Europe and North America has vexatiously discovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Most insect pests make their presence known by their appearance or by visible damage. Ah, but the termite is different. One can be experiencing the ravages of termites in his home without seeing or hearing anything until it is too late. This is because of their habit of shunning light and their uncanny ability as engineers. When termites excavate the intenor of a piece of timber they retain the protecting outer shell. Termite-riddled structures are so well excavated that they seldom fall of their own weight. It usually requires some force, such as a storm or an increase in the burden carried, as occurred in one instance when a recently installed piano crashed through a termite-riddled floor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">It is almost impossible to keep termites from getting to their favorite food. Even the hardest of woods succumb to termite attack. In their ceaseless quest for a woody repast termites are not at all reluctant to dine upon fence posts, telephone poles, furniture and houses. When they feel like it,</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">■ termites will readily extend operations to books, papers, leather and cloth. One scientist, studying tropical termites, set up his camp near the nest. He went to sleep. Upon awakening, he found his shirt had been eaten right off his back!</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Laboratory</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">What intrigues us is how termites get away with such an unlikely menu without suffering from upset stomachs. How can a</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">termite digest wooar me termite gives no thought to the problem of digestion, since the matter is handled by one-celled animals called protozoans. They live in the termite’s intestines. So thanks to these intestinal inhabitants the termite’s woody means are properly digested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Mr. Termite is likely to be unimpressed by barriers. If he cannot dig his way through a barrier with his jaws he simply calls upon his chemical laboratory to produce. It does, and presto! a termite acid is available. Termites “distill an acid,” says Frank Lane in </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Nature Parade,</span><span class="font20"> “which eats through the lead capsules of bottles, and manufacture a liquid capable of disintegrating glass. They can spread a juice on metal which rusts it, thus enabling them to bore through it easily.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">When food shortages hit a termite colony the situation is far from serious. The termites simply eat the walls of the termitary! How is this? Because the walls are plastered with termite excrement—something that can be used over again and is a very palatable concoction to the termite tastebuds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Thus termite food resources are almost inexhaustible. Why, a termite himself is a triple treat. They have the habit of licking one another, “These labial attentions, or lip affections,” says the Smithsonian volume on insects, “are not unrewarded, for it appears that each member of the colony exudes some substance through its skin that is highly agreeable to the other members. Furthermore, the termites all feed one another with food material ejected from the alimentary canal, sometimes from one end, sometimes from the other. Each individual, therefore, is a triple source of nourishment to his fellows.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Termite Society</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Different kinds of termites live in a colony, each kind performing definite duties for the good of all. Termite society is rath er complex, so suffice it to say that then are four distinct castes. The first caste is made up of king and queen and the winged termites that can themselves become kings and queens of new colonies. Workers make up the second caste, soldiers the third. The fourth caste is made up of the nymphs that take over the task of reproduction should the king or queen die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Workers are toy far the most numerous. As the name implies, the workers do the household chores, digging the nest, chopping the wood, manufacturing food for the king and queen and nursing the young. Workers are small, soft-bodied insects with small rounded heads. Theii* jaws are inconspicuous but effective. The jaws, with saw-toothed edges, easily shave off tiny fragments of wood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The soldiers have larger heads than the workers, for the soldier’s head, contains his fighting equipment. To defend the colony many species of termite soldiers have scissor-sharp jaws, others have both jaws and a glue gun, and some have only a glue gun. But what a gun!</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Protruding from the termite soldier’s snout, the glue gun is effective armament against invaders. Let the ants attack. The soldiers are ready for them, for the guns are loaded with a most potent kind of ammunition. They fire a gluelike liquid that hardens on contact with the air and that virtually petrifies an enemy. So when the ants attack, the soldier termites open fire. The glue gun salvos thoroughly gum up the enemy attack. Describing the effect of termite chemical warfare, Sir J. Arthur Thomson says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“When the soldier is on the offensive there is a rapid contraction of certain muscles on the sides of the head, and a jet issues from the beak. It consists, of a clear fluid with a smell like cedar oil; it is glutinous and resinous, and difficult to rub off. What the soldier does is to discharge this jet right in the face of an invading ant, and it is extraordinarily efficacious. Hie ants that have received the fatal douche are seen running about as if demented, but often stopping to rub their faces with their fore limbs, or to rub their heads against something. But they cannot get the stuff off, and they usually die.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The termite chemical warfare is amazing enough, but there is something else about it: the termite soldier in most species is blind! What mysterious sense of direction aims the soldier’s glue gun?</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Founding a New Colong</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Soldiers and workers are wingless. But one group of termites have long wings. These are the potential kings and queens. On a certain day a message is communicated through the colony. Workers open the doors. The long-winged termites swarm out Off they fly. But alas! most of them never become kings and queens, for they wind up as tasty tidbits on the menu of some bird. A few survive. They pair off, and the male and female begin looking for a home. Not needing wings any longer, they break them off. After a nest is dug and the exit to the outside world sealed off, mating takes place. In due time Mrs. Termite lays a dozen or so eggs. Soon the newly founded home is enlivened with baby termites. But what a surprise! The baby termites, instead of being replicas of their parents, grow up to be an entirely different kind of termite—either a worker or a soldier. And so it is with the second brood and the third. More workers and soldiers! This seems to defy the very laws of heredity, but it is a natural thing in termitedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Finally, as the broods keep getting larger, other forms begin to appear, the winged forms. At long last, replicas of the parents! TTiese develop into winged termites like the king and queen when they first flew out of the termitary. Eventually the day arrives for the new colony to have its first swarm. The doors are opened and the winged termites fly out, hoping to found a colony of their own. The cycle begins again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The king and queen live together peacefully. They are taken care of in a royal way. “The king,” reports the Smithsonian volume, “remains faithful to his spouse; and he, too, may fatten up a little, sufficiently to give him some distinction amongst his multiplying subjects. The termite king is truly a king, in the modern way, for he has renounced all authority and responsibility and leads a carefree life, observing only the decorums of polite society. . .. The queens of nearly all the termites that live in permanent nests attain an enormous size by the growth of the abdomen, the body becoming so huge that the royal female is rendered completely helpless, and must be attended in all her wants by the workers. . . . Her body becomes practically a great bag in which the eggs are produced, and so great is the fertility of these queens that the ripened eggs continually issue from her body. It has been estimated that in one such species the queen lays four thousand eggs a day, and that in another species her daily output may be thirty thousand.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The nests of these tropical termites are truly amazing. They come in all sizes and shapes and are built below the ground, above the ground and in the trees. The nests above ground may be in the form of a pyramid, an obelisk, a tower. They come in all heights, from a few inches to twenty feet. One of the strangest nests of all resembles a gargantuan mushroom; it</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">may reach sixteen inches in height, Some African termites build a pinnacled nest that may soar nearly twenty-five feet high' Such nests have been described as “fantastic cathedrals with buttressed walls and tapering spires/*</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">These nests above ground are remarkable for their hardness. The termite chemical laboratory produces such a fine grade of cement that a nest may bear the weight of several men. Elven with a pick and shovel tribespeople have a difficult time getting the termite cement—a prized item for building their own mud huts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Yes, the termite is amazing. Pernaps the most amazing thing about them is this: their habit that gives man so much trouble—their greed for wood—is, ironically enough, beneficial to man! Termites seem specially designed to turn dead and decaying wood back to the soil and atmosphere whence it came. Wood is not easily converted into fertilizer; but after treatment in the termite's chemical laboratory, it is returned to the earth as an important aid in soil fertility. Thus the amazing termite occupies a unique place in the natural cycle of nature.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">ABIES are born knowing how to suck. _ fact, some of t hTm - s u c k their thumbs before they are born. But thumbsucking is merely a convenient substitute for breast-sucking. It is good practice for baby, but it is nowhere near as satisfying.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font20">what? How baby be fed, There are what, when</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font20">From the time baby is born to the time mother’s milk begins to come there is a lapse of three to five days. New mothers especially wonder if the infant should be fed during this time. If yes, then with soon after birth should the and how often? they ask.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">about as many opinions on and how to feed babies as</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">there are babies born. (Statistics show that there are approximately 5,000 babies born into the world every hour.) Years ago it was believed that the newborn child should be given his first meal about twelve hours after delivery, then be fed regularly thereafter until the mother was ready to breast-feed him. But it was found that switching the baby from the bottle to the breast after he became attached to the him. He would refuse to nurse when put to the breasts. Mothers who wanted their babies breastfed became disturbed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">So naturally the practice changed. Now the baby is fed irregularly during this three- to five-day period with nothing but water. He is also allowed to suck his mother’s breasts during this time to keep in practice and to hasten the milk supply. The long wait does not harm the child. To the contrary, it does him good. It encourages him to make a vigorous bid for his food, which action is healthful for both baby and his mother. Often the amount of milk he gets depends largely on how strongly and persistently he sucks. So do not assist him to develop a lazy habit at mealtime by bottle-feeding him with milk beforehand. Make him work and beg a little for his food. He will enjoy his meal so much more that way: And, too, hungry babies switch from a water bottle to a breast filled with milk without any fuss whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">frequently motners ask if there are any advantages in breast-feeding a child. The decision, of course, is for mothers to make. And it should be made far in advance, because there are bottles and nipples to get, formulas to learn, schedules to chart, if you decide to bottle-feed him. But if you plan on breast-feeding your baby, most of those problems are eliminated. Nevertheless, there are things to think about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Breast-feeding calls for a great deal of understanding on the part of the mother. She must eat well if she expects to have a good supply of rich, nourishing milk. She cannot expect to starve herself and worry about her figure and build a healthy strong baby at the same time. Her breasts are nursing bottles. If she were bottle-feeding </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">her</span><span class="font20"> baby </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">she would certainly</span><span class="font20"> be careful to see that he got the right formula. Then she should take no less care even though she is breast-feeding by making sure die eats plenty of the right kinds of food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Advantages in Breast-feeding</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">There</span><span class="font20"> are a number of advantages in breast-feeding. First, mothers never have to worry about the temperature of the milk. The milk is there, it is always ready and it is always right. Nor do mothers have to concern themselves about the ingredients that go into the milk as long as they have a well-balanced diet. The body automatically makes the adjustment to satisfy the baby’s needs. Another thing, mother’s milk is always good and most satisfying to baby. There is never a chance for a mistake in the formula or a chance for exposure to certain infections. The milk is easily digested and is tops for body building. Breast-fed babies are almost never constipated, which is a great blessing in itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">When mothers breast-feed they have no formulas to worry about, no long lines of bottles to wash and sterilize, no spongy nipples to scrub and clean. Further, mother’s breasts secrete a small amount of colostrum the first few days after delivery. This early milk possesses a constituent that acts as a mild laxative that cleanses the child’s alimentary canal. It is also believed that it contains elements that foster Immunity to child diseases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Usually mothers feed their baby one breast at a time. When the breast is completely empty, then she is advised to switch to the other, but not before. Why? Because feeding this way stimulates the milk production. However, if the baby does not get enough to eat at one breast, then switch to the next but divide the feeding time between each breast equally. Years ago they held to twenty minutes a breast, but today the practice is to be flexible. (More about breast-feeding can be found in the June </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">22, </span><span class="font20">1954, issue of </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!)</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Bottle-fed Babies</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Babies that are bottle-fed should be given greater care. Be alert to sterilize all bottles and other equipment used in feeding. The more attention you give this matter to begin with the less trouble you will experience with your baby later on. Immediately after a nipple is used it should be scrubbed with soap and hot water. Just a casual rinse is not enough. Some particles of milk are liable to remain and be the cause of trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Mothers should see to it that the child’s </span><span class="font20">formula is adjusted from time to time, in keeping with his age and demand. It is well to feed the baby, not by ounces, but until he is satisfied. When he has had enough he will push the bottle away from him, or he will let the milk dribble out of his mouth. No doubt new mothers will feel more comfortable if they see a doctor periodically, especially during the first year of the child’s growth. The doctor can advise as to the child’s health and strength, whether his digestion and progress is good, if the formula needs changing, and other points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">If you are not able to afford a doctor or professional advice, you might be able to get a good book and read up on the subject. If a good book is out of your reach, certainly good sense isn’t. Then use it. That is all most good doctors use anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Caufs Milk and Solid Foods</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Mothers often ask whether cow’s milk is good for a baby. Cow’s milk is not the same as mother’s milk, nor is it as good for the child. But, nevertheless, it is an excellent food. Cow’s milk, however, must be handled very carefully from the time it leaves the cow until baby gets it or else it can cause trouble. It should be boiled or pasteurized before used, because germs flourish in milk. Raw milk is quite hard for babies to digest, but boiling and diluting it with water helps digestion. However, children have no problem with powdered milk, or with evaporated and homogenized milk. These digest quite easily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">There comes a time in a baby’s life that he must learn to eat solid foods. But when to begin is the question. Fifty years ago infants got their first taste of solid foods after their first birthday. Less than twenty-five years ago mothers broke away from the practice and began feeding their little ones solids when they were about six months old. Nowadays doctors advise that baby should get his first taste of solids between the second and the third month after birth. Dr. Benjamin Spock says: “It has been found that babies profit from reason-</span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">ably</span><span class="font20"> early solids, take to them readily, and are usually not upset by them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Start him off veby slowly. A baby three months old is very young and sensitive and can be upset very easily. Since he has been used to feeding on milk, give him his milk first and then introduce the solid piece. If you don’t follow this order you are liable to have an angry child on your hands. Remember, all a baby three months old knows is how to suck. So the first piece of solid food may cause him to squirm and pucker up. His sucking motion may push the piece out of his mouth. Gently swab off his chin and let him start over again. Close your eyes to the mess he makes. He will succeed eventually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Many parents like to start children off with cereals, but cereals often seem flat to a baby’s taste. Begin with a little piece of a ripe banana instead. After he becomes acquainted with the mechanics of chewing and swallowing, then feed him the cereal. Follow up the cereal with fruits, vegetables and other kinds of food. After he is six months old or older, feed him meat, but grind it first so that he will not have any trouble swallowing it. When the child is a year old he should be able to take his place at the family table. As far as manners are concerned “children have more need of models than of critics,” and “before you beat a child, be sure you yourself are not the cause of the offense.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">But to thrive, children need more than milk and solid foods. They need “T.L.C.” “This is so important,” says an authority, “that doctors in hospitals often prescribe ‘T.L.C.’ for babies who are not doing well. It means that the nurses are to see that they get an extra amount of ‘tender, loving care.’ ” If your baby is not doing so well, perhaps you might try giving him a little more of T.L.C. It often, succeeds where milk and solid foods fail.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">By &quot;AwakeI” carreipcndtnt In Northern Rhodeda </span><span class="font25" style="font-variant:small-caps;">lice Lenshina, an African woman about I thirty years of age, from Northern Rho-_ desia, claims she has received authority from God to be a queen. The assertion is made that she died, went to heaven and there God commissioned her to spread the gospel on earth. A couple of heavenly escorts brought her back to earth and here the Bantu female “messiah” made her Rhodesian appearance October, 1953.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">(L Lenshina’s followers look upon her as the &quot;Queen of the East?’ Their leaders command them: &quot;Look east! Where the place is of the one who rules over the world.” In a few short years she has gained an amazing fol lowing of some 70,000 members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">C The &quot;queen’s” religious doctrines are still somewhat vague. So far none of them have been put into writing. She claims she has an angel and to touch her could mean death. Further, she asserts that two angels provided her with two books, one for the Africans and the other for the Europeans. (Incidentally, ■ these books have never been seen by any of her followers.) She claims that all her commands come directly from God, that her followers are free not to believe the Bible, since it was not written by Africans, that she alone can free from the spell of witchcraft, and that she has the power to bless persons and property. For any favor bestowed, baptism performed or admission to the &quot;church,” a minimum contribution of one penny (one cent) is required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">C To supervise the rapid growth of her followers Lenshina has established a priesthood. The priests are known as educators and their teaching is called the &quot;highest education?’ But some question the quality of their educational work, because they lack training and knowledge of their priestly duties. Men chosen for office are offered the salary of £7 ($20) a month, though this salary may vary according to rank.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">C Morning and late afternoon, worshipers are called to attend service. &quot;Churches/' or Zumpas, as her followers call them, have been</span></p>

<p><span class="font25">&lt;[, What does the African see in this new religion? Instead of a church bell, a skin drum is used to summon the worshipers to services. Inside the lumpa is an altar and a three-foot-square banner of cheap black cloth that has written on it: Lenshina, the queen, reigns. Prayers that are said extol the queen, songs that are sung were composed by the queen and sing her praises. It is quite obvious that the woman lusts for praise and adoration. How unlike the true Messiah Jesus, who said: &quot;I do not accept glory from men.” “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing.”—John 5:41; 8:54. &lt;L However, many Africans have been frightened to her side because they believe she was restored to life by a resurrection and that she has powers over witchcraft and over death itself. The &quot;queen” has complained that the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of Scotland missions have hindered her work, although the orthodox European religions have done little to counteract her teachings that she has these strange mystic powers. Jehovah’s witnesses, on the other hand, have exposed her boasts to be false. Despite the decree of Lenshina that anyone who listens to the preaching of Jehovah’s witnesses will be smitten with immediate death, many honest Africans have defied her threats. They have openly listened to the witnesses and have lived and not died. This fact has forced the self-styled queen to retract her claim of having power over death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">&lt;L Lenshina, like many other self-made and self-ordained messiahs before her, does not have a remedy for the nations ora hope for the people, she is just a sinful daughter of Adam and Eve, an earthling, without redemptive power. &quot;Do not put your trust in nobles, nor in the son of earthling man, to whom no salvation belongs. His spirit goes out, he goes back to his ground, in that day his thoughts do perish. Happy is the one that has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in Jehovah his God/’^Ps. 146:3-5.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">By <sup>1</sup> ‘AwakeP* correspondent In Haiti</span></p>
<p><span class="font31">A</span><span class="font20">LL of Haiti’s four million people, from the president to the poorest mountain peasant, speak a fascinating 200-year-old tongue called Creole. It is the unique tongue of the masses. Though 15 percent of the population are educated in French, the country’s official language, yet they will frequently resort to Creole even for official business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Creole is characterized by short, monosyllabic words. It is dynamic and precise. Few words convey much. It is found to be simple in construction, rich in vocabulary, forceful and pithy in expression, pleasant and musical in sound. After having listened to a missionary preach to a group of persons a visitor, although in a hurry, explained in colorful Creole what held him for a while: </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">“Pie-m senti lou pou m~ale mesaj la telman dous”</span><span class="font20"> (“My feet felt heavy to depart because the message was so sweet”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">What is the origin of Creole? Is it African, French, Indian or Spanish? The morphology of the vernacular is interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries Spanish ships were heavily laden with rich cargoes from South and Central America. They sailed through the Caribbean waters and then on to Europe. French, English and Dutch sailors preyed on these ships. The lives of the Spanish traders were made miserable by these pirates and buc-</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19580708_files/g_E_19580708-14.png" alt="" style="width:156pt;height:232pt;">
<p><span class="font20">of la among buccaneers,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font20">northern part of France, having been seafarers all their lives. By 1660 they were well settled and established with their headquarters on an island off the north coast Haiti called He de Tortue. It was here, that Haitian Creole was born.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">French sailors from Normandy were by far in the majority of these pirates. Consequently, their tongue became the predominate one. This patois was gradually enriched with words of French buccaneers who came from other provinces of France. In Saint Domingue (now Haiti) French sailors spoke their own dialect, not the true French language. Even the best of families,, some claim, spoke this dialect, which, in the course of the years, produced what is called today Creole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The buccaneers often had contact with Indians and Spaniards, which contributed to Creole’s development. From the aborigines Creole borrowed names of objects that are common in the Caribbean area, Creole also adopted its style of verb for-</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font20">caneers, most of whom were from the</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font20">mation from the Caribbean Indians.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">The English and African Contribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">At times French buccaneers raided collectively with the English. During their association Creole turned to the English simple syntax. This systematic arrangement of forming sentences and phrases from words permits the foreigners to learn the tongue quickly. Both Norman and French were more complicated. Creole also contains an appreciable English vocabulary. Words like </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">djob, tou, canistd, cajou, bokit </span><span class="font20">and </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">biskwit</span><span class="font20"> were taken from the English words job, too, canister, cashew, bucket and biscuit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Creole, therefore, was a composed and spoken tongue before the African slaves were imported to Haiti. What, then, did the Creole language adopt from the Africans?</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">After buccaneering became an unprofitable business many filibusters turned to the land for a living. They became landowners, developing large plantations. Slaves were brought in from Africa to care for the labor shortage. These slaves spoke various African dialects, but received all their instructions from their masters in Creole. Their African tongues were eventually forgotten. Creole became </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">la mode,</span><span class="font20"> or the language fashion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The African, however, made additions to the language. All terms related to voodoo worship, such as </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">houngan, bo^or, Quango,, loa, zombi,</span><span class="font20"> and many others, were introduced. This was because the African slaves, though forced by the colonists to be baptized Catholics, were permitted to practice their own religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The Negroes in Haiti and in the United States found it difficult to pronounce the letter “r.” Words containing this letter were often slurred or the letter “r” was dropped out altogether. Also, the Africans altered Creole somewhat by giving it a new tone and an accent that gave it its harmonious rhythm and musicalness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Creole Proverbs</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Also of African origin are hundreds of descriptive Creole proverbs that have been added during the years. A few of these are mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Si Bon-DiA vlA, sain pa kapab,^</span><span class="font20"> meaning &quot;It is better to address God than to address his saints.” Another proverb is: </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Sa ou pa konb pi gran pose ou&quot;;</span><span class="font20"> literally, “What you do not know is greater than what you do.” In other words, you must respect what you do not know; or, whatever your knowledge there is always something you do not know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The expression “out of the frying pan into the fire.” Creole’s equivalent is: </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Kauri pou la pli, tombA nan gran</span><span class="font20"> that is, “Run from the rain, fall into the river.” Appearances are often deceitful. Everything that glitters is not gold. This is expressed in Creole in these words; </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;BAI ch&amp;v£ pa tarjan&quot;;</span><span class="font20"> literally, &quot;Beautiful hair is not money.” Care should always be taken in use of the tongue. In Creole it is stated: </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Lang pa lanmbr main li ney£ mait li”; </span><span class="font20">which means “Watch your tongue, it can lead you far”; or, you must turn your tongue seven times before speaking. Another proverb: </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Pa gardA piA bourrik pou bay li chay”;</span><span class="font20"> literally, &quot;Do not judge the strength of the donkey by its feet when you load it.” So, do not judge anyone by his height; appearances are deceitful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">When you believe you have overcome a difficulty another will arise. Eto not be presumptuous. You can always find something to learn. The future holds out surprises. All this can be conveyed by just four Creole words: </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;D&amp;yA mdn, gan mbn”;</span><span class="font20"> literally, “Beyond mountains, there are more mountains again.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The common statement is: “You must sow before you can reap.” The Creole proverb is slightly different. It says: </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">“Zherb pa poussA nan gran chemin&quot;;</span><span class="font20"> which means &quot;Plants never grow on highways.” Another proverb says: </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">“Pa janm entrti nan bomba san bat&amp;*;</span><span class="font20"> literally, “Never go to battle without a club.” This means, Before you undertake to do something you must be well assured of your means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Creole varies somewhat in different regions of Haiti. But despite its regional peculiarities it is quite easily understood by all. The educated and city dwellers will often intersperse Creole with French.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Is Creole a language or a patois? Some say that Creole is but a corrupt, degenerate French. However, a careful examination of its true physiognomy will indicate that it has definite rules of declension, grammar and rhetoric; it is a language of passion, of sorrow, of delicate nuance. Poems and large passages are being written mote and more by Haitian authors in Creole. Many Creole songs have become popular. The “New Testament” and the Psalms were translated into Creole several years ago. When Haitians express themselves emotionally it is always in Creole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">True, French is the official language of Haiti. Nevertheless, Creole is freely spoken by everyone, everywhere. It is la model</span></p>

<p><span class="font25">AVE you ever been stranded In a strange City because you lost your money or had lit stolen? It is not a pleasant experience. It is an experience yoti will want to avoid and can avoid by forethought and care. The many delegates coming to New York this summer for the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses should remember this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">While traveling be watchful of the things you set down. If you are in the waiting room of a train depot or plane terminal it </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">would </span><span class="font25">be unwise to set your luggage down and walk away from it to a newsstand or to some other place. It should never be lett unattended. Neither is it wise to turn your back on it while inquiring for information or buying something. Sometimes there are people in these places who are looking for carelessly watched belongings. While your attention is distracted they will casually pick up a suitcase and be gone before you realize it. Keep your possessions where you can watch them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">When leaving a plane, train, taxi, restaurant, hotel or any other place, always look back to make sure nothing is being left behind. The moment it takes to check is better than the time wasted trying to recover a lost article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">® While traveling by plane travelers will find that they will be asked to leave the plane for a few minutes at refueling stops. Even though the stop is a short one, do not leave expensive cameras on the plane or coats with valuables in the pockets. At times there are men among the ground crews who will not hesitate to take them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">A traveler to a big city like New York should remember that there are many dishonest people there who look for the opportunity to relieve careless individuals of their possessions. Outstanding among these are the pickpockets. They frequently work in teams or troupes. While one or two of them distract a victim another will take his billfold, quickly putting it into the fold of a newspaper carried in one of his hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">A cafeteria line is often a favorite spot for pickpockets. A person is not likely to drop a tray full of food to grab for his billfold if he suspects that it is being taken. If he should take one hand from the tray to feel for it the thief can distract him by warning that his coffee is spilling. During the distraction the billfold disappears.</span></p>

<p><span class="font25">C The large crowds gathered at Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds this summer will undoubtedly attract some of these thieves. For protection the delegates to the assembly should take precautions to protect their money. Put the bulk of it into a money belt or fasten it to the inside of a pocket. Do not keep all your money at one place on your person. It is best to carry money in the form of traveler's checks, but even then the same care should be taken to prevent the checks from being lost or stolen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">Reader's Digest</span><span class="font25"> gave some suggestions that would be well to keep jjj </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">mind: “Carry </span><span class="font25">with you only what money you need and don’t flash it. If you’re a woman, don’t let your handbag dangle; hold the bag itself with your hand over the clasp. For a man, an inside pocket is safer than an outside one; a purse in a hip pocket is the easiest pickings. Above all, be suspicious in crowds. Move instantly when jostled. Alertness and knowledge of the pickpockets’ techniques are the best means of assuring that you won't become cannon fodder [a victim].&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Those delegates to the assembly who plan on driving to New York should exercise the same watchful care of their belongings as those who travel by other means. Keys carelessly left in a car are an open invitation to car thieves. Always take the keys with you and be sure to lock the car. While in New York be extra careful about not leaving valuables lying in the car where they can be seen. This also applies to clothing and luggage. When something of value can be seen not even a locked car will keep out thieves. It is foolish to leave an open invitation for them,</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Take care of your belongings, and you will have them when you return home. Remember, it is easier to prevent the loss of your valuables than it is to recover them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men kept for unnatural purposes, nor men who lie with men,</span><span class="font25"> nor </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">thieves, . . . will inherit God's kingdom.—1 Cor, 6:9, 10.</span></p><img src="g_E_19580708_files/g_E_19580708-16.png" alt="" style="width:198pt;height:120pt;">
<p><span class="font31">T</span><span class="font20">HE Holy Scriptures state very explicitly that man was made “a little lower than the angels,” hence an inferior to his Creator and Maker Jehovah God. These same Scriptures testify that Jesus was “a man” approved of God. As a man, then, Was Jesus, the so-called second person of the trinity, lower or inferior to God? Religionists say no. They insist that Jesus Christ was a superman, a God-man, that to call him anything less would be degrading him.—Ps. 8:5, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">AV;</span><span class="font20"> John 1:30; 9:11; Acts 2:22, 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The Bible, on the other hand, definitely shows Jesus to be an inferior and Jesus Christ himself confessed that he was. Whom are we to believe, trinitarians or God's Word, the Bible?</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">All the Holy Scriptures bear witness to Jesus’ subordinate place toward Jehovah. Jesus always spoke of himself as the one that God had sent forth. In his last prayer he said: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” The apostle John heard that prayer and tells us: “For the one whom God sent forth speaks the sayings of God,” Jesus also told the Pharisees: “From God I came forth and am here. Neither have I come of my own initiative at all, but that One sent me forth.” Again he said: “I cannot do a single thing of my own initiative; ... I seek not my own will but the will of him that sent me.” Jesus Christ was ijou s aenr une or Apostle.—John 17: 3; 3:34; 8:42; 5:30;, Heb. 3:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Being sent of God, Jesus was not greater than his Father the Sender, neither was he as great. Just as Jehovah God with superiority over his Son Jesus Christ sent him to this earth, likewise Jesus Christ as Head and Master over his apostles and disciples sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God. He said in prayer to God his Father: “Just as you sent me forth into the world, I also sent them forth into the world. Righteous Father, the world has, indeed, not come to know you, but I have come to know you, and these have come to know that you sent me forth.”—John 17: 18, 25; 13:16; Luke 22:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Incidentally, in like manner the so-called “holy ghost” or holy spirit is proved to be inferior both to Jehovah God and to Christ Jesus. Why? Because Jesus told his disciples that the heavenly Father would send the holy spirit as a comforter in Jesus’ name, and Jesus added that he, in turn, would send this spirit comforter from the Father to his faithful disciples. And at Pentecost Peter declared that Jesus had shed this spirit comforter upon them. There is or has been no human nature about this “holy ghost” or holy spirit; and its being sent from God and through Christ proves it is subject to both God and Christ. —John 14:26; 15:26; Acts 2:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Let no one raise his eyebrows in amazement at our speaking of Jehovah God as superior to his Son Jesus Christ. Just read 1 Corinthians 11:3, where the apostle writes: “But I want you to know that the head of every man is the Christ; in turn, the head of a woman is the man; in turn, the head of the Christ is God.” To correspond with the fact that God is his Superior and Head, Jesus declared he came to do, not his own will, but that of his Father, and to speak, not his own words or doctrines, but those of his Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">In harmony with the prophecies of old Jesus declared himself to be a servant to God, and not a person coequal with God. Some prophetic utterances of Jehovah God respecting Jesus Christ as his servant are: “Behold, my servant, whom I uphold; my chosen, in whom my soul delighteth.” &quot;Behold, my servant shall deal wisely, he shall be exalted and lifted up.” &quot;By the knowledge of himself shall my righteous servant justify many; and he shall bear their iniquities.” These prophecies the disciples applied to Jesus, as anyone can prove by referring to Matthew 12:17-21 and Acts 8:27-37. Doing no dishonor to Jesus Christ by calling him a servant, the disciples in united prayer at Jerusalem said to the Lord God: “ ‘The kings of the earth took their stand and the rulers were gathered together to the same position against Jehovah and against his Christ.’ Even so, both Herod and Pontius Pilate with men of nations and with peoples of Israel Were in actuality gathered together in this city against your holy servant Jesus, whom you made Christ.Isa. 42:1-4; 52:13; 53:11, A8; Acts 4:26-28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Shortly before the afore-mentioned prayer Peter said to the Jews regarding the resurrected, glorified Jesus Christ: &quot;The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our forefathers, has glorified his Servant, Jesus, ... To you first God, after producing his Servant, sent him forth to bless you by turning each one away from your wicked deeds.” That this servanthood of Jesus toward God means his lower station and subordination to Jehovah God is made certain by Jesus’ own announced rule: &quot;A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a slave above his master.” Toward the close of his earthly life Jesus stressed a servant’s inferiority to his lord or master by saying to his disciples: &quot;Bear in mind the word I said to you, A slave is not greater than his master.”—Acts 3:13, 26; Matt. 10:24; John 15:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">As a </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">servant, an apostle and a</span><span class="font26"> disciple of Jehovah God the great Teacher, Jesus Christ tried to please his heavenly Father, his Life-giver. By this course he denied equality with his Father. Also, clearly enough for all but trinitarians to see, Jesus came out definitely with the announcement that the Father had superiority over the Son. In the illustration in which he likens his followers to sheep Jesus said: “What my Father has given me is something greater than all other things, and no one can snatch them out of the hand of the Father.” The Father’s superior greatness over all others included being greater than his Son, and Jesus said so in these unmistakable words to his disciples: &quot;The Father is greater than I am.” Again Jesus says: &quot;Concerning that day and hour nobody knows, neither the angels of the heavens nor the Son, but only the Father,” certainly an admission of superiority. Jesus told the Jews: “I do nothing of my own initiative, but just as the Father taught me I speak these things. And he that sent me is with me; he did not abandon me to myself, because I always do the things pleasing to him.”—John 10:29; 14: 28; Matt. 24:36; John 8:28,29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">The Scripture evidence is all against the trinitarians, for when Jesus said his Father was greater than the Son he was not referring to his flesh. He was referring to himself as an individual, even before he came to this earth and was made a man. Did not Jesus repeatedly say that God the Father sent him and that the Sender is greater than he that is sent?</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Let no one be sidetracked from a search to find the truth about the trinity by saying that the doctrine is a mystery. It is not a mystery. It is a pagan falsehood completely refuted by God's Word. Remain in this Word and you will be free.—John 8:32.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark25"></a>The Philippine Republic</span></h3>
<p><span class="font30" style="font-variant:small-caps;">C</span><span class="font20" style="font-variant:small-caps;">harles T. Russell, the first president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, in 1912 started the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom in the Philippine Islands by delivering a public lecture in the old Manila Grand Opera House. He had a good audience. Many who heard him speak wrote to the Society’s headquarters for literature. They read it and passed it on to their friends. In this way a groundwork was laid for future preaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">By 1933 a branch office was established in Manila to give direction to the few ministers in the islands. The work grew, and enormous quantities of literature were distributed. The outbreak of the war in the Pacific in 1941 brought a temporary halt to the free and open distribution of Bible literature from house to house. Approximately 373 witnesses of Jehovah faced a fiery test of faith and came off victorious;</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Caught in a “no man’s land” between the invading Japanese forces and the smaller but equally determined resistance forces, they pursued a </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">course of strict </span><span class="font20">neutrality toward the warring, worldly factions and kept incessantly preaching “this good news of the kingdom.” Jehovah God blessed their labor of love. In 1945, after the liberation of the islands, they gathered at their Kingdom Halls to rally their forces for further witnessing. Imagine their </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">surprise to find that their </span><span class="font20">meager army of 373 ministers had increased to 2,000! Wartime witnessing had paid off richly. Now there was great need for better organization, and the Watch Tower Society met the need in 1947 by sending the first three Gilead-trained missionaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">These missionaries had their first taste of witnessing in a war-torn land. They picked their way through bombed-out apartment houses and hotels, squeezed into makeshift shanties called </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">barong-barongs </span><span class="font20">and brought the comforting message of Jehovah’s new-world government to all kinds of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Public meetings were easy to arrange. The </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">outdoor audience never seemed to be </span><span class="font20">concerned about seats. They just stood quietly for the entire hour, shifting from one foot to the other and enjoying the novelty of hearing foreigners representing the Watch Tower Society. They were somewhat intrigued too by the simple and direct style of speech of these newcomers, which was in contrast with the rather flowery, oratorical style of their own countrymen. The speaker always had to be on the alert lest he be slyly entrapped in a debate. The bait for such a trap was generally in the form of an innocent remark by someone in the audience, such as “What you have said is very interesting, but 1 would like to ask a question.” If the question was entertained it would immediately lead to another question and another. The purpose of the questions was entertainment and excitement, not instruction. The alert minister would always conclude his remarks, close the meeting and </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">see to it that earnest inquirers were </span><span class="font20">properly directed to the nearest Kingdom Hall for further information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The purpose of sending Watch Tower missionaries into any country is to set the example in preaching and teaching the Word of Jehovah and in living up to that Word. Earnest Filipinos did not take long in following the right example. This was just what they wanted. And when they followed the right example their work was more effective than that of the foreign missionaries, because they knew the people, their customs, their feelings, their attitudes and their limitations. This is the very reason for the rapid spread of the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in the Philippines. The Filipinos themselves have spread the Kingdom message and its healing influence, People see the change that has taken place in them and they are impressed. They see their happiness, their orderliness, their enthusiasm and sincerity and they know that this is something that benefits Filipinos. What is good for so many Filipinos is good for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Preaching in remote territories of the Philippines can be as dangerous as was travel in the old American '‘wild west.’’ Lawless men and wild creatures of the rivers and forest can provide plenty of tension and excitement for the most courageous of ministers. One minister reported that on his trip up the mighty Agusan River into territory noted for crocodiles, pythons, monkeys and lawless men, it was necessary to identify oneself immediately and state the nature of the visit as soon as one came to each settlement. Not to do so would have been foolhardy and disastrous. The mayor of the settlement usually provided accommodations for lawful visitors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The Filipino people have taken firm hold of the Word of God and have spread it through the cities and towns, through their mountains and jungles. Like the Word of God, Jehovah’s witnesses are here to stay. From that little group of 373 who preached in 1941 there has developed an army of approximately 24,000 of them! Surely this is a fine response to the Kingdom message. Do you agree?—Isa. 60:22, AS.</span></p>

In Paris demonstrators called for the establishment of a government under General Charles de Gaulle, World War II head of the Free French movement and postwar provisional president of France. The 67-year-old wartime leader announced (5/15) that he was ready “to take over the powers of the republic.” At a news conference De Gaulle later (5/19) declared that he would assume control only by legal means and that though he desired &quot;exceptional powers” he had no intentions of becoming a dictator. Vast powers were granted to the Pflimlin government (5/17) in a state of emergency bill passed by the National Assembly, and proposals for constitutional reforms were later considered by the Cabinet (5/22). In the face of mounting tension, however, Premier Pflimlin resigned (5/28), whereupon 125,-000 Parisians demonstrated against De Gaulle. President Rene Coty warned the National Assembly that France was on the brink of civil war and that he himself would resign if a government under De Gaulle were not approved (5/29). General de Gaulle indicated that he would desire full powers for a “fixed time” in order to cope with the present situation, that he wished to have wide support and that constitutional changes on “the separation and balance of powers” would be prepared and submitted to the nation by referendum if he became premier. A National Assembly vote of 329 to 224 later (6/2) installed De Gaulle as premier and accepted his demands for six months of full decree power and authority to act to revise the constitution and to bring about reforms in the French Union.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">French Problems Abroad</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">&lt;§&gt; The French government crisis was felt not only at home but also in that nation's territories abroad. In Algeria forces of the French army assumed control, a committee of public safety was set up, and demands were made for a government under General de Gaulle. Later (5/24) a similar committee was formed on the island of Corsica, a French department in the Mediterranean only 100 miles from France. Still later (5/26) Tunisia’s President Habib Bourguiba requested British and U.S. intervention in the current Franco-Tunisian situation, especially with regard to the evacuation of 22,000 French troops stationed there. Strife between French and Tunisian forces resulted in a Tunisian appeal for consideration of the matter in the United Nations Security Council (5/29). The installation of a De Gaulle government (6/2) seemed to lessen somewhat the tensions in French territories abroad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Test Ban Talks</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">The establishment of technical groups to study means of inspection and control necessary for a ban of nuclear weapons tests was proposed recently (4/28) in a note from U.S. President Eisenhower to Soviet Premier Khrushchev. The Russian leader accepted the proposal (5/9) and Eisenhower later selected three experts who would represent the U.S. at the technical talks. Another U.S. note (5/24), suggesting that the first of these dis-’ cussions begin in Geneva within three weeks of Russia’s acceptance of the proposal, met with Soviet approval (5/31).</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Communist Conclaves</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">&lt;§&gt; Two meetings of nations of the Eastern bloc took place recently in Moscow. During a conference of the Council for Economic Mutual Assistance delegates met together from Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Russia, along with observers from Communist China, North Vietnam, North Korea and Outer Mongolia. At this meeting the Soviet Union disclosed intentions to implement a new Seven-Year Plan, the provisions of which were not revealed. On the economic parley’s concluding day (5/24) a communique was issued that indicated that the economies of the entire bloc would be integrated. Other matters were taken up when the political council of the Warsaw Pact powers convened (5/24). In a communique issued at this conference the countries of the Warsaw alliance declared that they would cut their armed forces by 119,000 men, they </span><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">approved the reduction of So</span><span class="font19">viet troop strength In Hungary by one division and they asked the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to agree to a non-aggresslon pact. Yugoslavia, presently involved in an ideological dispute with Soviet and other elements in the Communist bloc, was not represented at either meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Strife in Lebanon</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">In recent weeks Lebanon has been a nation of unrest and insurrection. Rioting began In Tripoli and spread to Beirut and other communities throughout the land. Lebanese President Camille Chamoun holds that the uprising was instigated by the United Arab Republic and that Syrian bands have crossed the border to aid the rebels. In the country's government itself political elements are at odds. Some are opposed to President Chamoun, are seeking to prevent his election to another term of office, and have even demanded his resignation. Chamoun has refused to quit (5/21) and intends to remain In his post until the present term ends in September. Beirut has appealed to the Arab League and has also made a formal protest to the United Nations Security Council (5/22) regarding the alleged Interference by the United Arab Republic in Lebanon’s internal affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">TT.s. ntuiaUlfm Air Defense</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">&lt;$&gt; A plan for joint control of tactical weapons and combat forces of the U.S. and Canada was implemented recently (5/12) with the exchange of formal notes between the two nations. The Nortfy American Air Defense Command (NORAD) thus established is designed to respond immediately upon the sighting of enemy aircraft in accordance with plans formulated by the two governments and with the </span><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">use </span><span class="font19">of weapons and forces made available to it. Nuclear </span><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">bombers of the U.S. Strategic </span><span class="font19">Air Command are not brought under this ten-year pact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Italian Kiectlons</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">&lt;$&gt; During Italy's recent general elections (5/25, 5/26) the nation’s political parties were arrayed in three distinct groupings—the extreme Left, the extreme Right and the Center. The Center parties, led by the Christian Democrats, won 42.2 percent of the total popular vote. In the new Senate the Center will have 133, the Left 98 and the Right 15 of the 246 elective seats. In the 596-seat Chamber of Deputies the Center parties will hold 324 seats, the Left-wing parties 224 seats and the Right-wing parties 48 seats. The extreme Left includes the Communists, whereas the Center parties are pro-Western,</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Panamanian Uprising</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">&lt;§&gt; Student demonstrations, reportedly in protest to poor school conditions, spawned armed conflict in Panama recently (5/22), During the six days of rioting, sniper attacks and street fighting, eight persons were killed and seventy were injured. The Panamanian government declared a state of siege, established a censorship board for the press and radio and suspended civil liberties in order to cope with the unrest and a threatened general strike. After the disturbances were brought under control by government forces, Panama’s President Ernesto de la Guardia, Jr., declared that the student demonstrations had served “as a catalytic” for a rebellion that constituted &quot;a direct attack to overthrow my Government.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Amnesty for Perfin</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Argentina’s Chamber of Deputies recently (5/22) voted amnesty for that nation’s former dictator, Juan Per An and his followers. The bill, previously passed by the Senate, was signed by Argentina’s President Arturo Frondizi and it thus became a law. The new law’s “ample and general amnesty” covers all crimes and misdeeds, common or military, having to do with labor union or political aims. From exile in the Dominican Republic, the ex-dictator, though not opposed to the law, called the amnesty a “trap.” He held that magistrates who had displayed “a lack of fairness toward all kinds pl persecutions against Peronista citizens&quot; and who were responsible for administering the law might seek to jail him and his followers if they returned to Argentina.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Space Ventures</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">&lt;$&gt; The U.S. Army recently (5/18) fired into space a Jupiter rocket and shortly thereafter retrieved its nose cone from the Atlantic Ocean. Though a four-foot scale model nose cone had been similarly recovered in August, 1957, this was the first time a fullscale cone had been sent through space and had withstood the intense friction encountered upon re-entry into the earth’s atmosphere. The missile had traveled about 1,600 miles and had descended upon its predetermined target area at approximately 9,000 miles an hour. This indicated that ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads could apparently do the same. It was also lauded as a step toward the safe re-entry into earth's atmosphere of other space vehicles. Among other things, the nose cone had been provided with signal lights, hallo o n s, parachutes and even shark repellent as aids toward its recovery. In a later assault on space (5/27) the U.S. Navy attempted to place in orbit a 20-inch, 21i-pound instrumented earth satellite with the use of a Vanguard rocket. The vehicle, though successfully launched, went into an abnormal flight and failed to carry the “moon” into orbit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">JAPAN GOES TO THE POLLS</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">over forty million Japa</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">nese voters went to the pons recently (5/22) to elect members of a new House of Repre-sentatlves. Confronting each other were candidates of two principal parties, the LiberalDemocrats and the Social Democrats, The Liberal-Democratic party, headed by Premier Nobusuke Kishi, gained the majority vote and acquired 287 of the 467 seats in the House, the lower chamber of the Japanese Diet or parliament. One of the major campaign issues was the matter of relations with Communist China. The Socialist party favors immediate recognition of that government, whereas the Liberal-Democrats are not now ready to recognize the Peiping regime. Kishi’s party is pro-Western.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Missile Accident</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Death came to ten men and injury to three others in a recent explosion of eignt JNixe-Ajax antiaircraft missiles at a U.S. Army base near Middletown, New Jersey (5/22). Technicians were installing new arming mechanisms in the vehicles when, for some unknown reason, one of the missiles exploded, setting off seven others. Nike-Ajax missiles are twenty feet in length and a foot in diameter, are powered by rocket engines, have a 25-mlle range and are equipped with nonatomic warheads containing TNT. While no one off the base was injured as a result of the accident, many local residents now appear to be opposed to the Army’s plans to install at this and other defense bases in the vicinity missiles with atomic warheads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">H-Bomb Still Untamed</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">In August, 1957, British scientists believed that they had achieved thermonuclear fusion reaction and were thus on the road toward harnessing the power of the hydrogen bomb for peaceful purposes. With the use of the ZETA apparatus they had heated hydrogen or deuterium gas to over 5,000,000 degrees for a period of three one-thousand ths of a second. During this experiment energy was emitted in the form of neutrons, and highly accelerated particles were then thought to have fused with other similarly accelerated particles. It was recently (5/16) disclosed that the reaction produced at that time had actually come from the collisions of atoms of high velocity with those of low velocity, or accelerated particles with relatively static particles. This did not constitute true thermonuclear fusion reaction, Britain is planning to construct a new device more powerful than ZETA, and with it another attempt will be made to tame the hydrogen bomb.</span></p>
