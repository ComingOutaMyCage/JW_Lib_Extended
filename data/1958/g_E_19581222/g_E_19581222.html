<p><span class="font23">T</span><span class="font16">HE presence of moral corruption in a society is not the sign of a healthy society but the sign of a sick one. Its spread produces ever greater problems that make peaceful living difficult; crime increases, violence grows, more and more families are broken up because of marriage failures, social diseases rise, contentions and injustices multiply. Living in such a society becomes precarious. This is the type of society that exists world-wide today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Commenting on the bad fruits it is producing among children, especially in the United States, Judge Samuel Leibowitz stated: “We are fast approaching the time when this nation will have over 2,000,000 persons who have appeared in juvenile courts. Although our child population has increased only 25 percent from 1948 to 1957, appearances before juvenile courts have increased almost 150 percent in the same period. This is a shocking situation.’* —New York </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font16"> February 13, 1959.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The situation is the outward evidence of the moral corruption that exists in modem society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Despite its bad fruits moral corruption has sales appeal. It sells books, magazines and dramas. More often than not the theme of a popular story is moral corruption. In glaring lights and colorful posters theaters stress the immoral features of the movies they show in order to increase sales at the box office. Publishers of many magazines make moral corruption prominent in their cover illustrations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Murder, sadism, beastliness and almost every form of moral degeneracy are served to this generation as entertainment by TV, movie, stage and literature. How can such themes have an upbuilding effect upon either young or old? Regarding TV presentations the Senate Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency said in its report, as published in </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">U.S. News &lt;£ World Report:</span><span class="font16"> “Television, available at a flick of a knob and combining visual and audible aspects into a ‘live’ story, has a greater impact upon its child audience.” “Life is cheap; death, suffering, sadism and brutality are subjects of callous indifference and judges, lawyers and law-enforcement officers are too often dishonest, incompetent and stupid. The manner and frequency with which crime through this medium is brought before the eyes and ears of American children indicates inadequate regard for psychological and social consequences.” “Repeated exposures to scenes of crime and violence may well blunt and callous human sensitivity to, and sympathy for, human suffering and distress.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">There are, of course, dramas and works of literature that do not depend upon moral corruption to sell them. These leave a more constructive impression upon the minds of people than those that do depend upon it. But the fact that so many people respond to the appeal of moral corruption is significant. It shows how the world thinks. It should not be surprising, therefore, that unlawful acts are committed by children who copy what they see adults doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Since fleshly tendencies are not inclined naturally toward good morals, there is a certain fascination in seeing or reading stories in which people throw aside moral restraints. But by feeding the mind upon such things how can a person build up resistance to the wrong desires of the flesh? How can it help him maintain a </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">high standard of</span><span class="font16"> morals?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Because immorality is a common thing in the world, that does not mean it should be glorified in literature, on the stage and on the screen. It is something to be deplored, not built up as a box-office attraction. Playing up violations of God’s laws gives the impression that the committing of such sins is the thing to do and that to resist them is being old fashioned or Victorian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">If</span><span class="font16"> the people of this world had respected God’s laws, its society would not be morally and spiritually sick. It would not have the social problems of love </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">triangles that </span><span class="font16">result in heartaches and often violence, of broken families, of child crime and adult crime, of social diseases, of caring for thousands of illegitimate children, of criminal violence and of war. The good principles and laws set down in God’s Word are the basis for a healthy society, a society that produces good fruit. Personal moral standards that disregard the standards set down by God can lead only to trouble. The bad fruits now being reaped by the present world society are clear evidence of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Persons who recognize the wisdom in the moral principles of God’s Word see how important those principles are for man’s well-being. Christians of the first century were such persons. Many of them thought and acted as the world did before they became Christians, but then they changed. Regarding this change one of them said: “Yes, among them we all at one time conducted ourselves in harmony with<sup>-</sup> the desires of our flesh, doing the things the flesh and the thoughts willed, and we were naturally children of wrath even as the rest.” (Eph. 2:3) Another one said: “The time that has passed by is sufficient for you to have worked out the will of the nations when you proceeded in deeds of </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">loose conduct, lusts, excesses with wine, </span><span class="font16">revelries, drinking matches, and idolatries that are without legal restraint.” (1 Pet. 4:3) The legal restraint of God’s laws on conduct is needed just as much today as it was back there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Moral corruption has an appeal because of the weakness of human flesh. A person should, therefore, be careful when selecting literature and dramas. Why should he leave himself open to having his moral integrity weakened by low-grade entertainment?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The Bible gives good advice when it says: “Whatever things are true, whatever </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">things are of serious concern, whatever </span><span class="font16">things are righteous, whatever things are chaste, whatever things are lovable, whatever things are well, spoken of, whatever virtue there is and whatever praiseworthy thing there is, continue considering these things.” (Phil. 4:8) When a person does that he strengthens his capability to resist base fleshly weaknesses that lead to moraf corruption. “God is not one to be mocked. For whatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap.”—Gal. 6:7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DOES RELIGION MEASURE <sup>Z</sup>UP?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">God'* Word loll* u* to &quot;molt* &gt;uro ol all thing*; hold fmt to what t* right.” (1 That*. 5: JI) To htlp you to do that i* tho purpoio of what follow*. </span><span class="font1">^7^,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font23">A</span><span class="font16"> BRIGHT and eager youth had just recently finished his high school term. At his first place of employment he came in touch with a new and interesting religion—new as far as he was concerned. He found its message so reasonable and inspiring that before long he left the religion of his parents and was baptized in that faith. This so distressed his orthodox parents that they insisted he have an examination by a psychiatrist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Trying to ascertain just what caused this youth to change his religion, the psychiatrist asked him about his school studies. It turned out that he had won a scholarship. Friends? He had some good ones. What about girls? They were all right; in fact, some were very nice. After a few more such questions the psychiatrist asked in desperation: “Then whatever made you get mixed up in that crazy religion?” Answered the youth: “That’s where you’ve got it all wrong, doctor. I was all mixed up before I got in touch with it. It straightened me out.” And to prove his point he began to ask the psychiatrist questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The result of it all was that the psychiatrist reported to his parents: “There’s absolutely nothing wrong with your son. He’s perfectly O.K. But what I would like to know is what caused you two to get so disturbed about your son changing his religion?” Today this young man is a missionary in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">This points up the controversial nature of religion. It is a subject more often associated with emotion than </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">। with </span><span class="font16">reason. However; since there is nothing that has </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">more </span><span class="font16">far-reaching effects than the kind of religion we have, we should be</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">willing to reason soberly on the subject. Unless we are willing to accept the Hindu point of view that all religions are all right, we must admit that not all the some thousand religions of Christendom, not to say anything regarding all those of the Eastern world, are true and right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Religion may be said to be the means by which one recognizes the object of worship. It will hardly be disputed that religion should do five basic things for us: (1) reveal to us the name and personality of the One worshiped; (2) reveal his purposes regarding the earth and man; (3) reveal what is required of man in relation to his God and his fellow man; (4) furnish the impetus, desire and will to do what God requires; (5) and finally, impart strength to do what God requires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Creator</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The religion that is truly based upon the Bible, the Word of God, meets all those requirements. It reveals to us God as the creator of “earth and heaven,*’ with whom “is the source of life.&quot; Regarding his name he states: “I am Jehovah. That is my name; and to anyone else I shall not give my own glory, neither my praise to graven Images.” That name, appearing </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">upward </span><span class="font16">of 6,823 times in the Hebrew Scriptures, is a Hebrew word of four letters and is therefore termed the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">tetragrammaton.</span><span class="font16"> It literally means “he causes to be.” That name is most fitting, for he, indeed, has caused all things that exist to be.—Gen. 2:4; Ps. 36: 9; Isa. 42:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">What are his attributes or basic qualities or characteristics? His Word shows that they are power, wisdom, justice and love. The universe gives overwhelming testimony to his great power. Fittingly he appeared to Abraham and others “as God Almighty.” Well could He ask that patriarch; “Is anything too extraordinary for Jehovah?”—Ex. 6:3; Gen. 18:14; Rom. 1: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Another attribute of God is wisdom, regarding which his grand, majestic and beautiful universe also gives eloquent testimony. God’s wisdom is not only to be seen from his material universe but also in his principles, laws and record of dealings as made known in his Word. No wonder the apostle Paul, who was familiar with these could rapturously exclaim: “Oh the depth of God’s riches and wisdom and knowledge! . . . who has come to know Jehovah’s mind, or who has become his counselor?”—Rom. 11:33,34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">At once both satisfying and yet fearinspiring is God’s justice, another of his basic qualities. As Moses sang: “The Rock, perfect is his activity, for all his ways are justice. A God of faithfulness, with whom there is no injustice; righteous and upright is he,” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">We may </span><span class="font16">therefore rest assured that a teaching that is repugnant to justice cannot he true of him, nor be taught in his Word.—Deut-32:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In striking contrast to the cruel characteristics of so many man-made gods, the God of the Bible is the very personification of love: “God is love,” we read. He delights in loving-kindness and mercy. As he </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">proclaimed to Mases: “Jehovah, Jehovah,</span><span class="font16"> a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and truth.” Yes, he “loved the world [of mankind] so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.”—1 John 4:8; Ex. 34:6; John3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Does your religion measure up to the first of these requirements by revealing such a God to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">His Purposes</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">As to the “why” of things, our origin, purpose of existence and our ultimate destiny, scientists admit that they do not know, and philosophers can but speculate. However, the religion truly based on the Bible does acquaint us with these all-important truths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It shows that God created the earth to be man's lasting home, not “to totter to time indefinite, nor forever,” but for ail time “to be inhabited.” (Ps. 104:5; Isa. 45:18) It further shows that God created man “out of dust from the ground” and breathed “into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man came to be a living soul.” Man was made in the image and likeness of God, we also are told, this meaning, not a physical image and likeness, but that man was given a measure of God’s four attributes of power, wisdom, justice and love, and in that man was given dominion over the lower animals. Additionally, man was mandated to fill the earth with offspring and to “subdue” it, make it all like the paradise in which he found himself. To test mankind's appreciation and worthiness of God's goodness they were commanded not to eat of the fruit of a certain tree.—Gen. 2:7; 1:26-28; 2:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">However, it was not long before man and woman betrayed their lack of appreciation by permitting themselves to be seduced by an unfaithful spirit creature or angel and thus lost their paradise home as well as their right to life. God did not at once destroy the rebels and create others, because, for one thing, he had begun his great rest day, which rest God’s Word shows is continuing down to the present time. But more important still, the unfaithful angel, now termed Satan and Devil, taunted God that he could turn all other creatures away from God. To prove Satan a liar and God supreme it required that Satan be let live to attempt to prove his boast. More than that, the deflection of our first parents raised the question as to who was to blame, God or they. Letting them live and bear children and then having these face the same test would show whether or not keeping integrity toward God was possible. All this is made clear especially in the book of Job and fully vindicates God for letting suffering and wickedness continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Down through the centuries faithful men have proved God true and the Devil a malicious liar, and so in the very near future God will put an end to suffering and wickedness. Then the earth will reflect the marvelous attributes of the Creator: “They will not do any harm or cause any ruin in all my holy mountain; because the earth will certainly be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters are covering the very sea.” Then God “will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be any more.”—Isa. 11:9; Rev. 21:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Thus we see that God’s Word effectively silences the carping of the ancient and modern atheistic and agnostic philosophers who insist that the presence of evil in the earth proves that there is no God worthy of our worship. They say that either he is weak and unable to stop it or he does not want to stop it and therefore is lacking in justice and love. That God could have a good reason for permitting it and that its existence is for but a brief moment, as God reckons time, is the solution to the enigma that never dawned upon those worldly-wise men; yet that is exactly what the Bible shows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Does your religion give you such a logical explanation of the permission of evil, one that satisfies both mind and heart?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Knowing and</span><span class="font16"> Doing </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">the Divine</span><span class="font16"> Will </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">for Vs</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">What is the divine will for us? Jesus summed it up in the two great commandments: “You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind and with your whole strength,” and “you must love your neighbor as yourself.” To love God is to keep his commandments, among which are to make one’s dedication, to undergo baptism and to lead morally clean lives. And whenever Caesar’s commands conflict with God’s we must remember the apostolic principle: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men,&quot;—Mark 12:29-31; Acts 5:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">For Jesus that divine will included preaching. As he told Pilate: “For this purpose I have been born and for this purpose I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth.” His followers are to do the same. That is why he sent forth the twelve and later the seventy and why he gave, apparently to an assembly of five hundred, the parting admonition: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations.” The best way this can be done today is by co-operating with </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">others so</span><span class="font16"> that “this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations.”—John 18:37; Matt 28: 19; 1 Cor. 15:6; Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">God does not leave it up to us individually to interpret what his will is for us. He has ever had spokesmen or organizational channels of communication to transmit his will to men, such as Noah, the nation of Israel, Jesus Christ and the body of apostles and older men at Jerusalem. Today there is a New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses that stands ready to help all who sincerely want to know and ao the divine will. With it is found the “faithful and discreet slave” body of anointed Christians that takes the lead, even as Jesus foretold.—Matt. 24:45-47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Does your religion so clearly and fully make known the divine will for individuals today?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Coming to the fourth requirement, we find that the truly Bible-based religion gives us the incentive, impetus and will to do the divine will. For one thing, it shows that doing it is most wise, as it means peace of mind and happiness now and everlasting life in God’s new world of righteousness. (Matt. 11:28-30; Rom. </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">6:23) </span><span class="font16">What an incentive to do the divine will! Further, it makes us feel the obligation to do the divine will by driving home the fact that Jehovah is our Sovereign, Lawgiver, Life-giver and Owner. We are indebted to him for everything as long as we live on his earth, and the only way we can have a clear conscience is to acknowledge that debt by obeying his commands, by doing his will. (Mal. 1:6) Above all, the true religion shows that love for God and appreciation of all that he has unselfishly done for us should make us eager to do the divine will. Love begets love. (1 Chron 29:14; 1 John 5:3) Yes, the logic, the rightness and the beauty of Bible-based religion gives us the incentive, impetus and will to do the divine will. Does your religion measure up in this respect?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">And finally, the Bible-based religion gives strength to do the divine will and to endure in doing it. This comes from a knowledge and </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">understanding of and faith </span><span class="font16">in God’s Word, which “is alive and exerts power.” It shows us our privilege of prayer, how to pray, what to pray for and what we must do to have our prayers answered. It helps us to receive God’s holy spirit by means of </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">which</span><span class="font16"> we can have strength for all things. And it brings us in touch with the above-identified channel God is using at the present time, and with fellow Christians, both further aiding us to do and to keep on doing the divine will.—Heb. 4:12; Zech. 4:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Proof that this Bible-based religion does indeed give persons the incentive and impetus to do and to endure in doing God’s will is seen on every hand. It is seen in the fact that there was an increase of 9.8 percent in Kingdom proclaimers in 1958 over 1957, for a monthly average of 717,088. It is seen in the fact that they devoted more than 110 million hours to the preaching work. It is also seen in the fact that in eight lands behind the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Iron</span><span class="font16"> Curtain more than 95,000 Witnesses have kept integrity, refusing to compromise and continuing active in their ministry, resulting in an increase of 21 percent in their ranks. It was seen in their 1958 Divine Will International Assembly held in New York at which close to 200,000 Witnesses from 123 lands joined in worship of Jehovah and in receiving knowledge of the divine will and the incentive and the strength to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Does your religion measure up also in these respects?</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">I</span><span class="font16"> REIMEMBER Seoul as it was in 1949-50. It was a whole city overflowing with refugees from the Communist North, but its residents were full of hopes and aspirations. The Korean people had been liberated in 1945 from forty years of occupation by the Japanese, and by authority of the United Nations had their very own government established as the Republic of Korea, October 15,1948. Suddenly, on June 25, 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, and the ravaging of a country began on a scale probably unequaled in this twentieth century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The city of Seoul was 60 percent destroyed, while in the key downtown section 80 percent destruction was estimated. Some 40,000 homes were completely wiped out. Communications were all but gone and public works were rendered almost totally ineffective. Memory of a walk through the streets of Seoul in December of 1951 is still vivid. The debris had been cleaned up. The bricks were piled neatly by the streets. But this seemed only to emphasize the desolation. Only about one fifth of the former population was still in the city. There was almost no transportation. The quiet seemed abnormal until it was broken occasionally by the rumble of the big guns from the front. The war was still going on then.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">What about Seoul today? It is hard to realize that this bustling, changing, progressing city of Seoul today is the same place it was then. There are now 1,700,000 residents in the city. Some 60,000 homes have been rebuilt. The main thoroughfares have been repaired and the city has plans now for asphalting the side streets and narrow winding alleys that make up most of Seoul’s passageways. The scars of war are for the most part concealed.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19581222_files/g_E_19581222-9.png" alt="" style="width:169pt;height:252pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">It used to be that most of the businesses closed up after dark. The streets of downtown Seoul at night were gloomy and there was little pedestrian traffic after things closed down. Electricity was rationed and there was none for advertising purposes. Now all that is different. Flashing neon lights have come to Seoul. It leaves a cheerful effect on the populace to see the colorful displays downtown now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Perhaps the biggest difference in the city is transportation. Streetcar service has been increased and extended. Buses are available for every part of the city and suburbs. These buses are made of locally fashioned bodies mounted on former military truck chassis. In Seoul, Pusan, Taegu and a few other cities a familiar sight has become the Hapsung or group-taxi, which follows a prescribed route. These small vehicles are patterned after the American Willys Station Wagon, but are a bit smaller. It is not unusual to see thirteen persons jammed into these taxis. A passenger may go anywhere along the route for twenty cents. One company making these vehicles did not see why it could not go its American counterpart one better, so on all its vehicles one can see a large easy-to-see chrome-plated casting mounted on the hood reading, &quot;6-Wheel Drive.” These Hapsung taxis have done as much as anything to make life more convenient in the capital city. During the* rush hours all forms of travel are crowded to the limit</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Korea’s people are more on the move now than ever before, especially the women. In prewar times the women were more confined to the area of their homes. Now it is easier to go and come. Noticeable in the past five years has been the trend in women’s clothing toward Western styles. Beauty shops giving permanents are found everywhere. The cosmetic business is booming. Many Western customs are being absorbed. Also, the crime rate has increased and Korea is meeting teen-age delinquency for the first time on </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font16"> large scale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Plastic, nylon and vinyl have in recent years changed the shape and color of the household utensils. Chopsticks used to be fashioned of wood or brass or silver. Now plastic chopsticks are as common as wooden ones used to be. The old-fashioned oiled-paper umbrella has been replaced by the vinyl-covered bamboo frame. In the larger cities the ladies still use the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">pojae</span><span class="font16"> (large kerchief) to carry large purchases, but until it is needed to wrap up a clumsy bundle it is kept inside a bright colorful vinyl bag Or purse. In prewar Korea one seldom saw the ladies carrying purses. The kerchief-wrapped bundle had been the custom for centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Economic Stabilization</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The Korean war, 1950-1953, left the country with more than a million dead, including both military and civilian. Property damage was estimated </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">at upward of $3 </span><span class="font16">billion. More than half the transportation facilities of the nation were destroyed, as was 40 percent of the marine transportation. Throughout the country 600,000 homes had been destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">To absorb and overcome the economic shock was a monumental task and one that Korea was unable to meet witnout outside help. It has received that help from the United Nations and from the United States in particular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The bulk of assistance to Korea has come directly from the United States. More than $2 billion has been given to the Republic since the beginning of the Korean war. An undisclosed amount, but believed to be at least equal to the economic aid, has also been given in the form of military aid. Korea maintains the second-largest armed force in the free world and fourth in the entire world. Manifestly this could not be maintained without United States aid. Since the United States began assisting its allies in World War II, it has given more aid to Korea than any other single country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The agency that directs the United States’ huge aid program in Korea is the Office of Economic Coordinator (OEC), which is under the State Department’s International Cooperation Administration. The OEC declared that conditions had been returned to prewar levels. Generally speaking, Koreans’ living conditions equal those of 1949-50 in almost every field except housing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Now the emphasis is being placed on financing such projects as thermal and hydroelectric plants to alleviate the power shortage. One of the world’s largest fertilizer plants is nearing completion in Chong-ju. Part of the nation’s needs are being produced in a paper mill, new cement factories and a plate-glass factory—all built with United States aid. Effort is being directed to capitalize on Korea’s fishing industry so that it can export more marine products to bolster its own economy. The backbone of its economy is agriculture. Flood control measures are being undertaken. Reforestation of its denuded mountains is a huge undertaking that has just begun. It has been estimated that at its present rate of consumption Korea’s few remaining forests would be exhausted within fifteen years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The protection of the remaining forests required the changing of the home-heating fuel that has prevailed for centuries. The Koreans have used wood to burn in their under-the-floor fire pots. Now a briquette of coal that is circular with nineteen holes punched in it for air vents is used instead. In cities an ordinance against the use of wood as a fuel prevails.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">When one compares present conditions with those of wartime, there is much progress. But still there is much hardship for the average Korean. Estimating Korea’s labor force to be 8.2 million and combining unemployment estimates with underemployment, the total unemployment is about 25 percent of the working force. Salaries are insufficient to support an entire family. Thousands of families live day by day, depending on their income for the day to buy the food they eat in the evening. Most families must be content with one or two rooms, with the kitchen either a lean-to or in many cases out of doors. If a home owner has three rooms, chances are that at least one is rented out to another family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Inflation, if not checked, has been considerably slowed down. Prices now are about the same as they were a year ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Theaters have been built in almost every neighborhood. People have more money for recreation now than in the war years. In the large cities one can see a foreign movie in Cinemascope if he wishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">While plans for repairing the water system of Seoul and other cities are under way, it still is a fact that only 25 to 30 percent of the people of Seoul have access to purified treated water. Two treatment plants, an intake tower and a booster pumping station all are nearing completion, and Seoul’s water problem will soon be much improved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Education and Reunification</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Schools have had an early priority in rehabilitation programs. In the city of Seoul alone there are 188 public and private high schools and ninety-two elementary schools. Still schools are overcrowded. Plans for increasing classrooms are under way. It is hoped that within a few years the use of entrance examinations for middle and high schools to select only the better students can be abolished so all can have equal opportunity of attending schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">What about Korea’s role in the family of nations? She has had eleven years’ experience now and knows what she needs to survive. Korea is a child of the United Nations. The great powers have their ideas of the precarious road Korea must follow, Korea, however, stands pat on her own policies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Much has appeared in the public press about the United Nations recommendation to unify Korea through U.N.-sponsored elections. No one issue is so important to Koreans in general as reunification of their divided country. On November 12, 1958, the United Nations Main Political Committee voted 52 to 9 in favor of a resolution calling for free elections in Korea. It was the eleventh straight year such a resolution was passed. It has little chance of succeeding. The conditions Communist North Korea places on the elections are such that the Republic of Korea could never agree. North Korea has less than one third of the total population, yet it demands equal representation in the legislature that would then adopt a constitution for the whole of Korea. Even then conditions would have to be such that North Korea could rig the results to suit its own needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The Republic of Korea has long maintained that the proposed free elections be held only in the Communist North. All elections since 1948 in South Korea have been under the observation of the United Nations Commission for Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. Therefore, Korea’s stand is that U.N.-sponsored elections have already been held here. The government spokesman, Oh Chae-Kyung, director of the Office of Public Information, made clear Korea’s stand in an article, saying: “Any suggestion that this Government will consent to nationwide elections before unification is totally incorrect.” Korea would insist that the people of North Korea elect in a U.N.-supervised election a proportionate number of representatives to the already existing National Assembly. Blank nationwide elections prior to unification would, in Korea’s view, mean subscribing to the dissolving of its own established sovereignty. The </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Korean Republic in</span><span class="font16"> its editorial said flatly: “We are not about to accept any such abridgement of our sovereignty.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Armistice</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The Korean government did not sign the armistice that ended the fighting in Korea. It merely agreed that it would not interfere with the armistice between the U.N. forces and the Communist forces for a period of 180 days. That period ended early in 1954. Now the Koreans want the armistice scrapped. They did succeed in getting the U.N. side to void the portion prohibiting arms build-up in Korea, because the Communist North was using it as a screen to build up its own strength while the U.N. was adhering to the agreement Korea would like to see the rest of it scrapped. In the official view the armistice is not only the longest armistice in history, but the greatest farce in </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">history. Koreans </span><span class="font16">resent the meetings with the Communists at Panmunjom, because the Communists use it for a propaganda sounding board.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Korea does not agree with the United States policy of containment of communism. She believes that territories swallowed up by the Reds must be liberated, particularly North Korea, and she </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">believes </span><span class="font16">this can be done without risk of nuclear conflict. In commenting on this subject, the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Korean Republic,</span><span class="font16"> January 6, 1959, stated editorially: “The way to peace and a better world can come only when America realizes the fallacy of containment, for our time. May this be the year of such realization and the beginning of victory.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Religion is flourishing in the Republic of Korea today. Buddhism is the largest, with 3,000,000 adherents; all sects of Christianity are lumped together to comprise the second-largest group, with over </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">1,000,000 </span><span class="font16">members. Most of the remaining population have no formal religion, but do follow Confucianism and observe rites and 'customs in honor of their ancestors. Protestant and Catholic groups hail Korea as the most fruitful field in the Orient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Amidst all </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">this, 3,456 faithful</span><span class="font16"> witnesses of Jehovah are preaching to their fellow citizens the good news of Jehovah’s established kingdom under his reigning Son, Jesus Christ. Ninety congregations and groups of these practicers of true worship are to be found scattered throughout South Korea. </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">More and more people of </span><span class="font16">good will are finding peace and comfort in God’s promise of a righteous new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Man today, with all his advanced scientific techniques, finds restoration of the scorched earth a slow and painful process. True restoration of the earth, no matter how </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">it be ruined by mankind, will be</span><span class="font16"> accomplished in the true sense during the thousand-year reign of Jesus Christ following Armageddon now near.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">HEN you look at a map, do you ever stop to think just how it is made? Have you ever wondered just how the map maker was able to represent accurately and proportionately so many details on his map, despite its covering hundreds of miles, perhaps a whole country or even the whole earth? The way in which the science of map making, or cartography as it is also called, has been developed is truly cause for wonder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It would be difficult to fix definitely when man first began to use maps. No doubt from the very beginning sketches of some kind were employed to represent the earth’s surface. But it is supposed that these were deficient in true geographical value because of mistaken concepts concerning the earth. To the ancient Greek philosopher Homer the earth was a disc surrounded by a mighty river, the ocean being simply a current that completely encircled the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Early Map Making &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">When was the first map of the world made? It is believed to have been made in the sixth century B.C. by the Greek philosopher Anaximander. It was circular and showed the known lands of the earth around the Aegean Sea at the center, and surrounded by the ocean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It was not until Aristotle of the fourth century B.C. that scientific geography began to come to the fore. He demonstrated the theory of an earth with a spherical form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">One of the most famous maps of ancient times was drawn by the Greek geographer Eratosthenes about 200 B.C. It represented the known world and was the first to have transverse parallel lines to show equal latitudes. The geographer also supplied some meridians of longitude, although they were irregularly spaced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Map making, as we know it today, owes much to Hipparchus of the second century B.C. He is attributed with the invention of trigonometry, an essential for gaining facts for cartography.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In the Middle Ages progress leading to the development of mathematical cartography came to a standstill in Christendom, though not in the Islamic world. Due to an unreasonable literal interpretation of the Holy Scriptures some clergymen held that the theory of a round earth was heresy. Yet the prophet Isaiah, some seven hundred years before Christ, wrote: “There is One who is dwelling above the circle of the earth.”—Isa. 40:22,</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Many have been the developments, direct and indirect, leading to modern cartography. To name a few: the development of movable type in the fifteenth century, the' discovery of the Americas, the voyages by Magellan and other navigators, the findings in astronomy by Copernicus and the solution to the problem of how to create a fiat map that would compensate for the curved surface of the earth. How was this problem solved?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It was Gerhardus Mercator that attacked the problem. In 1568 this Flemish geographer devised a system in which the north-south meridians were made parallel from pole to pole and every degree of latitude from the equator to the poles was lengthened in the same proportion as the meridians had been distorted to make them straight lines. This distorted distance but kept directions correct. The Mercator Projection surpassed all others in utility; and now, almost four hundred years later, the projection he developed is still extensively used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Intricacies of Modern Cartography</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Today map making with its many fine techniques and precision instruments is a near perfect science. For “horizontal control&quot; whole nations have been marked off in a network of triangulations. The points of origin of these have been determined with great care, being fixed in longitude and latitude. These points, known as datum points or fundamentals, are places where there are few or no unfavorable conditions. In North America “the datum&quot; is located in Kansas at a place established in 1927 and known as Meade’s Ranch. This ‘'datum&quot; is used by the United States, Canada and Mexico and is to be used in the Caribbean and Central American areas. To check the accuracy and trueness of these datum points or fundamentals astronomical observations are made. In order to have markers for the network of triangles that are constructed from these fundamentals or datum points, concrete posts containing a plaque with explanatory information are located at the vertices of the triangles. Once this basic “horizontal control” is determined then a supplementary horizontal control is added. This is done by forming or constructing a minor network of triangles to the above-mentioned. The purpose of these Is for filling in details.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">To determine certain elevations above sea level a cartographer must establish a “vertical control” To obtain this he must first obtain the average sea level by an instrument called a mareograph. After this he can determine elevations of his previously placed concrete posts. Much is involved in establishing “horizontal control” and “vertical control&quot;; only some of the basic information has here been discussed. However, once these have been established the cartographer is ready to go to work, gather information, make his mathematical calculations and proceed with the actual map work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">For maps of small areas information can be gathered with comparatively little equipment Usually a surveyor’s transit and a measure are the essential instruments. However, for maps of larger areas and greater accuracy, aerial photos are almost a necessity. According to Frederick Gutierrez Braun, director of the Geographical Institute of Costa Rica, no really accurate map can be made without aerial photos. So for up-to-date and accurate map making, helicopters, airplanes and precision cameras are needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Back at the office, the cartographer uses other instruments to translate his photos to map scale. Upon completion of the mapping process, the cartographer is ready to make his map reproductions in color.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Mistakes, Changes and Progress</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Despite the great degree of accuracy of modern maps, embarrassing errors crop up now and then. According to one of America’s noted cartographers, Richard Edes Harrison, many of these mistakes rest on a common foundation. “A great many embarrassing mistakes,” he says, “could be avoided if map makers had at least a nodding acquaintance with geography, the mother science of cartography.&quot; He tells about an expensive error on a map of Southwest Asia, published by a noted Institution and distributed in the millions, that showed the Kabul River passing &quot;into the headwaters of the Kunduz River, flowing into the Amu Darya and winding up in the Aral Sea without once diminishing its width—an error that could not have been made by anyone with an elementary geographical knowledge of the region.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Maps are constantly being brought up to date. New communities are established, some change names and some are abandoned. New highways appear. Wars change boundaries. Even earthquakes may cause a map revision. An earthquake near Dixie Valley, Nevada, pushed snow-capped peaks upward and dropped the valley floor. So there are many reasons why the map maker’s work is never completely done. &quot;Less than half the area of the United States is adequately mapped,” says </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Science Digest, </span><span class="font16">&quot;and the entire job won’t be completed for at least half a century. Only two states— Massachusetts and Rhode Island—are completely mapped.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Valuable Purposes of Maps</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Some persons may feel that the great sums of money and technical knowledge needed for cartography are unwarranted when it comes to putting a few lines on a piece of paper. However, the great value of maps more than justifies the expense and effort in their production. Through use of maps a motorist can travel thousands of miles in places he has never known or seen and yet arrive exactly at his destination. Many persons consult maps to find the general location of a city, lake, mountain or country. For such information a highly accurate map is not necessary. However, a very accurate map will give detailed facts and information, such as the location of a river, a waterfall, railroads, highways, the height of a tnountain, the depth of the ocean and land contour. So maps are invaluable to the navigator, pilot, prospector, geologist, construction engineer and, of course, the motorist.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">To understand the value of a map consider this example: A highway is proposed to connect two different cities. Were it not for a map, an engineer would have to conduct a series of costly explorations over the land before he could even sketch a proposed route. Even then he is liable not to pick the best route. But with an accurate map in large scale it would be a relatively easy matter to fix the ideal route. In Costa Rica the government, in road building alone, has saved hundreds of thousands of colones by having at its disposal good maps.</span></p>

For example, Revelation 16:16 refers to Har-Magedon or Armageddon. This term is framed with evident reference to the &quot;Mountain of Megiddo.” According to a Bible map Megiddo overlooked the pass through the mountains between the plains of Sharon to the southwest and the plains of the valley of Esdraelon to the northeast. Anyone controlling the pass was in position to be victorious in battle. Seeing the location on a map helps one fix in mind background information to the term Armageddon.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">people, afflicted by a despotic dictator, had the privilege of obtaining justice by trial of the same dictator. It happened in Colombia. G. Rojas Pinilla, ex-president and ex-dictator, was put on trial before the Senate of his country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">G. Rojas Pinilla, the ex-commander of the Colombian forces participating as part of the United Nations forces in the Korean war, served as president of Colombia for a period । of four years, 1953 to 1957. On May 10, 1957, he was forced into exile by a civilian-student revolution. After a period of exile in the Canary Islands, Pinilla returned to Colombia in the latter part of 1958, upon receiving a guarantee of justice by Ueras Camargo, the new president.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">On December 3, 1958, a plot to assassinate government leaders, along with further subversive moves, was discovered and attributed to the returned ex-dictator. As a result he was placed in custody and sent under guard aboard a Colombian navy vessel in the Caribbean Sea. Here Rojas Pinilla remained till his recall on January 21, 1959, to face the government charges in Senate session.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A Senate verdict of guilty could result in his loss of political rights and his being sent to the Supreme Court for trial on criminal charges. A civil court verdict of guilty could result in various penalties, even Pinilla even finding himself in prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Though many charges have been placed against Pinilla, ■ -..the n^wspapaa»E7 </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Tiempo</span><span class="font16"> of Bogotá said editori-</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">ally on January 23, 1959: “That</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">—t-Ke moral question—is the primary reason for his trial. The rest may be details of secondary importance, minor things or great failings. But the essence of all is found in that crime of indignity, that means so much and represents so much to a republic that has always had the rectitude of its rulers as a standard, their nobleness as an example, their honesty as a fertile teaching.*’ President of the Senate, Edgardo Mano-tas Wilches, said: “In a democracy like the one re-established in Colombia, the right of defense is sacred. . . . Colombia is setting a magnificent example for the continent.” </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">(El Tiempo,</span><span class="font16"> January 26, 1959) The present government leaders hope to carry out the trial of Rojas Pinilla completely according to the Constitution of Colombia. So it could well be an example to the South American continent and to all the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The trial began with the reading of a mountain of indictments against the ex-dictator. On the first day, seven hours were spent reading thirty-two documents. General Pinilla and his defense counsel had a right to answer any of the charges made as they were read. The reading of the declarations and accusations lasted for four complete sessions of the Senate and part of the fifth. The charges were many and varied. They ranged from misuse of government power to falsification of incometax returns as to sources of income. Another charge was that of smuggling cattle into the country for personal gain, using government power to facilitate the smuggling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Personal Gain</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Following the reading of the charges, the senators had the right to question Pinilla. The first session of questions was lively indeed, as one senator asked sixty-three questions in sixty minutes. They were pointedly directed at Pinilla's financial dealings while he was president. It was pointed out that his income, as reported on his tax returns, rocketed from 49,000 pesos to 2,000,000 pesos in four years! How was this financial marvel accomplished? the ex-dictator was asked. “Gifts from Colombians and foreigners,” he replied, adding that gifts of personal property increased in value and were, in turn, sold. Much time was spent considering Pinilla’s transactions involving large farms for sums of money as high as 700,000 pesos. Commenting on this, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">El Siglo</span><span class="font16"> of January 29, 1959, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“The tedious reading of extensive documents of the proceedings now in progress against Rojas Pinilla in the Senate, has served to refresh in the minds of Colombians the memory of the dishonest systems that prevailed'during the rule of tyranny. From all those documents emerges vividly portrayed the figure of a ruler given to business deals and favoring his family and friends through State measures dependent upon his decision.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Following the charges concerning financial dealings while in office, attention was suddenly turned to the mysterious death of the Liberal leader, Jorge Eliecer Gaitan. Dr. Gaitan was murdered April 9, 1948; at the time of writing the murderer has not been apprehended. The Liberal senators put very pointed questions to Pinilla concerning the killing. However, Rojas Pinilla consistently refused to comment on the murder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Government prosecutor Dr. Uribe Prada, citing parts of the Constitution, began a detailed listing of the specific charges against the ex-dictator. One charge was that he had consolidated the legislative, judicial and executive branches of the government under his dictatorial power. This was contrary to the strict division of these branches of government as listed in the Constitution, Misusing the power of administration of justice was another charge. His relations with the banking organizations were also mentioned as misuse of the presidential office. Charges and countercharges were made. But from all this, the noteworthy benefit was mentioned in the editorial called “Freedom to Hear” appearing in </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">El Colombiano</span><span class="font16"> of Medellin, Colombia, of February 1,1959-. “In the trial now in progress against Rojas Pinilla in the Congress of the Republic, the judges are not the only ones interested. Public opinion must also have complete knowledge as to what takes place and what is said. Freedom to hear whatever may be useful in elucidating facts now under investigation and even others upon which light can be shed, should not be stifled as in times past.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">General Pinilla was unable to answer satisfactorily questions about a company he and his son formed and about their payment of taxes or even keeping company books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Ex-Dictator’s Defense</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">After the charges of personal enrichment, the time came for the defense. A lawyer for General Pinilla, Daniel Valois Arce, took up the task of defending the ex-dictator, doing so eloquently in a passionate speech. The gist of his argument was that Pinilla was being judged by the effect and not the cause. He argued that all the horrible conditions had merely come about as the result of the bloody presidential term of Dr. Gomez, the president before Pinilla. After explaining in detail the terrible conditions that existed under the Gomez regime, Dr. Valois went so far as to compare Rojas Pinilla with Julius Caesar and Simon Bolivar. It was a melodramatic scene; but the newspapers pointed out that the figures showing personal enrichment spoke far more eloquently than </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font16"> dramatic efforts of the defense lawyers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Dr. Carlos V. Rey, the second defense lawyer, then began an exposition for the ex-dictator’s defense. This lasted for many four-hour Senate sessions. Because of his lengthy speech, the defense lawyer became ill. The hearings were postponed for several days. By this time the hearings </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">had </span><span class="font16">consumed more than a month, and the senators were becoming increasingly agitated because of the slow progress and the pressure of other government work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Next came the opportunity for exchanging charges on the part of the accusing senators and the defense lawyers. The ex-dictator decided to take charge of defense arguments personally. He made a lengthy speech that covered the time of several sessions. He restated many past arguments made by his lawyers. He maintained that the charges against him were without foundation. Pinilla repeatedly pointed to progressive steps in the development of Colombia during his presidency. However, many times his statements caused the audience in the Senate gallery to burst out with laughter and jeers. Repeatedly Pinilla charged that past presidents were to blame for conditions that developed during his presidency. In defense the ex-dictator declared: “The banks loaned more money to [ex-president] Gomez than to me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Rojas Pinilla next recounted his life history, especially the events that led to his becoming president. Speaking of the time when he was a military officer in the city of Cali, during a rebellion on April 9, 1948, Rojas Pinilla said he made the following statement to a new group of recruits when ordering them against the people: “As you don’t know how to aim yet, you should direct your aim at the stomach, so that if it happens that you change your aim then undoubtedly you will not miss.” The statement caused a sensation in the newspapers, arousing anger against Pinilla’s cruelty. During Pinilla’s long exposition, many heated exchanges took place, both sides making charges of lying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The trial had begun on January 22; now it was March 10, and it was hoped that Pinilla would end his defense. But then the ex-president, after his many hours of speech-making, became </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">ill. When medical </span><span class="font16">reports proved he had a heart condition along with diabetes, the hearings were repeatedly postponed. Then Pinilla’s defense lawyer became ill, and the hearings came to a standstill. Finally, after considering Pinilla’s medical reports, sessions were set by the senators; but both Pinilla and his lawyer failed to arrive for the hearing. So they lost the right to terminate the defense speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Climax &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>(</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It came March 18. After seven hours of secret session, the Senate, at 1:15 a.m., found Rojas Pinilla guilty on two charges. The first charge was that of violating the Constitution, the vote for “guilty” being 62 to 4. The second charge was that of misusing the presidential office for personal gain. The Senate found him guilty on this charge by a vote of 65 to 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A committee was formed to determine the sentence. This was delivered and approved April 1, after eight hours’ deliberation, by a vote of 44 to 17. The ex-dictator’s sentence included: (1) The loss of the right to be elected or to elect others to public office. (2) The loss of military rank and official honors. (3) The ineligibility to exercise guardianship appointed by courts. (4) The Ineligibility to serve in the armed forces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">(5) The ineligibility to retain the rights, jobs, offices or grades previously held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">After more than two months and more than ninety hours of speech-making, the trial of the ex-dictator ended. That phase of the political trial is history, and the future will tell if he will be tried before a civil court for more serious crimes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">What is the attitude of the Colombian people? At first the trial was a sensation and on the lips of everyone, but the interest soon faded. Yes, they remember the trial and the horrible events of the preceding years, but now they are more concerned with their existence at this moment. As the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Correa</span><span class="font16"> of Medellin, Colombia, summed up the events on April 5, 1959: “With the sentencing of the accused, another chapter in the history of Colombia is brought to a close; for the first time an ex-president of the republic is sentenced by the Senate, acting as a court of justice, to be deprived of political rights, after a lengthy trial that lasted almost three months and was full of action.*’</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Yes, the world watched and felt it, bad received an example of democratic justice. But true Christians remember the significance of Proverbs 29:2: “When the righteous become many, the people rejoice; but when anyone wicked bears rule, the people sigh,” They look farther than to the courts of man for justice. They put their trust in the kingdom of God for justice, peace, tranquillity and new-world conditions free of present-day widespread hunger, sickness and corruption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Anticlericalism in Spain</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">C In his recent book </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">The Yoke and the Arrows,</span><span class="font15"> Herbert L, Matthews, one of the editors of the New York </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font15"> gives a report on Spain: “The popular belief that the Church has wealth in excess of fits] needs and that it fattens on the country’s revenues while the people lead harsh and hungry lives has contributed to the extraordinary force of Spanish anti-clericalism. . . . Anti-clericalism in Spain far antedates the blrtit of Karl Marx- ■- . . Whenever in modern times the bayonets that guarded the Monarchy and Church were removed, there was a terrible popular outburst. Church burnings and the killing of priests and nuris, in their modern phase, go back to 1835, a century before the latest Civil War. . . . The hierarchy today devolves from the Counter Reformation, when the Catholic Church in Spain was saved by its close alliance to the throne and by a rigid censorship that kept the peasantry ignorant as well as poor. Through its grip on education (only temporarily interrupted by the Second Republic), the Church has sought to inculcate qualities of obedience, acceptance of the established</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">order, suspicion of modernity... . The Church , ., has at most times in its history concerned itself too much with material possessions.,.. </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">&lt;L </span><span class="font15">&quot;A student of Spain can only be amazed and heartsick at seeing generation after generation of the Spanish clergy repeating the same mistakes and building up the same forces of hatred that take such a terrible toll when the lid blows off. As of today, it is Generalissimo Franco. 'And I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’id,,</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">and I met few Spaniards who denied that when he dies there is going to be another explosion of anti-clericalism. . . . The Roman Catholic Church is stronger today in Spain than ever before, and it always was strong. . . . Censorship today means infinitely more in this age of newspapers, radio, movies and books than it did then, and control of education means much more in an age when nearly everybody is educated. Moreover, Ferdinand and Isabel dominated the Church. Franco certainly does not do so, as the Concordat shows.

<p><span class="font16">1958 with an improved model. Theirs was the first of the turbojets to begin regular transatlantic service. The British were also the first to put turboprop planes into commercial service. These are planes that use jet engines to turn propellers, whereas the turbojet is a jet engine without a propeller.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Pan American was the first </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">airline to begin using</span><span class="font16"> the new Boeing 707. Other airlines are following close behind. The Boeing planes will be joined by jet liners from a number of other companies in late 1959 and</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">W</span><span class="font16">HEN you travel do you prefer an oxcart to an automobile? Or a rowboat to an ocean liner? Chances are you do not. You want speed and comfort. The less time spent traveling means more time at your destination. For speed and comfort the jets have it. They can take you farther in less time than any other means of public transportation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Jet aircraft are revolutionizing commercial aviation. They are cutting hours from the flight times of the fastest piston planes. The transatlantic jets of Pan American World Airways are making flights to London in six and a half hours as against twelve hours for a DC-7C. The jets of American Airlines have cut the flying time from </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">New York to Los Angeles </span><span class="font16">from nine to five and a half hours. By allowing for the time difference, this means a person can arrive in Los Angeles two and a half hours later than when he left New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The British were the first to introduce jets to commercial aviation. This was in 1952. Their Comet I, however, proved to have a structural defect that forced them to discontinue turbojet service temporarily in 1954. But they renewed it in the fall of early 1960. In the meantime the Boeing 707s, the British Comet 4s and the Russian </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">TU-l04s</span><span class="font16"> have the field of commercial turbojet travel to themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">An Impressive Plane</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The Boeing 707 presents a striking appearance, I was much impressed by it when I stepped into an immense Pan American hangar and saw one for the first time. It had clean lines. Its streamlining was emphasized by its giant wings being swept back at a 35-degree angle. The wings had a spread of more than 130 feet. Its tail towered high above me—about four stories up. It is a big plane, and it looks big. Its weight of some 246,000 pounds rested upon ten wheels. There were two landing gear units, each consisting of four wheels. The nose assembly had a two-wheel unit. The over-all impression given by the plane was that it was built for speed. It cruises at 585 miles an hour. This is considerably faster than the big piston plane, the DC-7C. Its speed is 350 miles an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The four jet engines of the Boeing 707 that hang beneath its wings add to its streamlined appearance. I walked over to one that had its cowling removed. It appeared to be nowhere near as complex as an airplane piston engine. Its eye-level height made work ori it easy. I asked my guide how much power it had. He replied that “each engine has a thrust of more than 13,000 pounds.” That would be enough to lift more than six tons straight up. I inquired about the cluster of tubes in the rear of the engine. These, I was told, suppressed the engine’s noise by breaking the exhaust gases into many streams. Boeing spent about ten million dollars to develop it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Workmen were swarming about the plane like ants around an anthill. My guide explained that the plane was being serviced and was due to be rolled out to the field in about thirty minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">There were two doors on the left side used for loading and unloading passengers. I was interested in these doors as I had read that they were of unique design. One of the workmen explained that the doors were designed to act like a plug so as to prevent cabin pressure from blowing them out at high altitudes. He said: “The engineers did an amazing job of designing a door that passes through a doorway that is smaller than it is.” He proceeded to show what he meant. He grasped the forward door, which was swung back against the outside of the fuselage. I noticed that it was hung on rods that were hinged on die frame as well as on the door, which allowed for a certain amount of lateral movement. He slipped the door through the doorway edgewise and on an angle. It was then entirely inside the cabin. He then pulled it toward him, since he was standing outside the plane, until it fit snugly into the doorframe like the stopper of a bottle. There would be no chance of air pressure pushing that door out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Passenger Comfort</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I asked my guide about the capacity of the plane. He said it would vary as to whether the plane was filled with deluxe-class or economy-class passengers or with both. “If the entire plane is loaded with economy passengers,” he said, “it will hold 157. If it is loaded with deluxe it will hold 96.” “Why the difference?” I asked. “Deluxe seats are larger and have more leg room. We carry 115 passengers—half deluxe and half economy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">When we were in the cabin of the plane I could see why there would be a difference in seating capacity. As my guide had said, the deluxe seats were much larger than the economy seats. Where there were three seats in the economy section, there were only two in the deluxe section. The deluxe seats had considerably more leg room. A long-legged passenger would have a cramped trip in the economy section. I noticed that the seats were on tracks. I was told that this allowed for easy rearranging of seats when necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The deluxe section was in the front part of the plane and was separated from the economy-class by a partition that did not quite reach to the ceiling. Its accordiontype door prevented passengers in the two classes from mixing. Each class has its own galley and flush toilets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Fitted on two tracks under the hat shelf were the service consoles. One was located above each row of seats within easy reach of the passengers. Each contained a call button, three reading lights, three individual air outlets, a loud-speaker and lighted signs to notify passengers when seat belts are to be fastened and when smoking is not permitted. There were oxygen masks in each console that automatically pop out when cabin pressure drops below that found at 14,000 feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Fresh air is taken into the plane through ducts above the engine intakes. It is passed through two air-conditioning packs, where it is either cooled or heated and excess moisture is removed. It is then passed between the walls and into the cabin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Pan American jets are equipped with infrared ovens that are capable </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font16"> handling sixteen meals each in seven minutes. This does not mean the meals are prepared from scratch. Most of the work is done in the company’s kitchens at the airports. There the food is cooked and frozen. The ovens on the plane thaw them out and prepare them for serving. When I was in Pan American's </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">big kitchen at New York </span><span class="font16">International Airport I was shown some of these frozen dinners. They were neatly packaged and tucked away in a large refrigerator. A kitchen employee showed me the menu of what is served to the deluxe passengers on the transatlantic flight to London. It listed, among other things, Iranian caviar, terrapin soup with sherry, lobster, Himalayan partridge with wild rice, prime rib of beef, vegetables, salad, cheese, ice-cream cake with liqueur, fresh fruit and an assortment of beverages. This dinner and a light breakfast was the extent of the food served. It is unlikely that passengers could eat more than this on a six-and-a-half-hour flight. Those riding in the economy section have to be content with sandwiches and a hot drink.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The difference in food and seating comfort between the two classes is due to the difference in fares. The deluxe class pays a round-trip fare </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">to London of</span><span class="font16"> $909.50. The economy class pays much less—$453.60.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">How </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Jets Function</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Jet </span><span class="font16">planes operate on the principle expressed in Newton’s Third Law of Motion. It states: &quot;To every force there is an equal and opposite reaction.” This means that the gases expelled from the jet engines at </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font16">high rate of speed kick the plane forward. The more gases expelled, the faster the plane will go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Air is taken in through the large opening in the front end of the jet engine. It Is directed into the blades of a compressor by a bullet-shaped piece of metal in the center of the opening. The compressor whirls at a high speed and forces the air through a tapering channel. At the narrow end the compressed air enters a combustion chamber. There are two in the engine of the Boeing 707. There it is mixed with kerosene and ignited by a spark plug. Once this mixture has been ignited, combustion will continue by itself as long as fuel and air are fed into the engine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The jet engine has a voracious appetite. Each one on the Boeing 707 gulps in 415 gallons of kerosene an hour. Compare this with the DC-7C whose four piston engines, all together, consume 480 gallons of fuel an hour. ITie four jet engines use </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">nearly </span><span class="font16">four times this amount.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The hot gases in the combustion chambers of the jet engine spin a turbine at high speed and then shoot out the rear opening of the engine. The turbine spins the engine’s compressor and also turns a generator that supplies the aircraft with electricity for operating its many accessories. Most of the engine’s 50,000 horsepower is used up by the turbine. The power remaining in the gases that speed out the engine’s tail pipe amounts to about 17,000 horsepower. This is the power that does the work of propelling the plane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">When a Boeing 707 takes off, water is </span><span class="font16">injected into the compressor section of each engine to increase temporarily the thrust of the engines. More than 700 gallons are carried for this purpose. The jet liner climbs toward its cruising altitude of 25,000 to 40,000 feet at a rate that is twice that of conventional piston planes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">When landing, conventional planes use their propellers as air brakes by changing the pitch of the blades. But the turbojet has no propellers. How does it brake when</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">land</span><span class="font16">in</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">g</span><span class="font16">? I asked my Pan American guide about this. He took me to a spare jet engine and pointed to two dam-shaped doors Immediately behind the engine and in front of the tail pipe. “These,” he said, “can be dosed to direct the engine's thrust through vents in the side.&quot; I could see that when the clam-doors are closed the gases would be deflected out the sides at a slightly forward angle. This forward thrust would act as a brake and slow the plane down. I was told that these thrust reversers are not always needed, because the plane’s massive landing gear units help to slow it down by air resistance, and the wheel brakes do a good job of braking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Turboprop</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The turboprop airliner is not as fast as the turbojet, but it is swifter than piston planes. Its engines are basically the same as those on a turbojet. The principal difference is the propeller that has been attached to an extension of the compressor shaft. The plane propels itself by means of the propeller as well as by the thrust of the engine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The propeller prevents it from reaching the high speeds of the turbojet plane, but it has the advantage of much higher operating efficiency. Its range is almost twice that of the turbojet at speeds of 400 to 500 miles an hour. The fuel burned in a turbojet represents about 50 percent of its operating costs, whereas fuel is only 27 percent of those costs in the turboprop. It may be expected, however, that the efficiency of the turbojet will be improved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Turboprop planes have become a familiar sight th commercial aviation, because they have been in use for a number of years. They are playing a big part in the jet revolution that has struck the air transportation industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">More than two billion dollars is being invested in jet planes by the airlines. The change-over from piston planes is extremely expensive. One Boeing 707 costs about five million dollars. To finance these purchases the airlines are going deep into debt American Airlines has ordered 110 jets, including turboprops, at a cost of 445 million dollars. By renting the engines they have reduced the bill to 365 million.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The only way the jets can pay their way is for them to fly with capacity loads and to be kept in the air as much as possible. That means a great many more people will have to travel by air than at present England’s experience with jet travel shows that jets increase the percentage of air travelers. As long as the airlines remember that low fares can bring a large volume of passengers they should have little difficulty in filling their planes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It is most unlikely that anyone in this modern age would prefer to travel far by oxcart when faster means of transportation are available. Time is valuable. Jet liners are fast short-cuts to distant points. As travel timesavers the jets have it.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>

A youthful Witness behind the Iron Curtain in East Germany received a ten-year prison sentence for preaching underground. Though repeatedly penalized for helping her brothers, she was released after five years. Commenting on her own experiences, she writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt; &quot;When I came to the --- prison in 1952</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I found Witnesses who had been there two years, during which time they had received no spiritual food from the outside. When 1 was permitted to write out letters I broke off a piece of a pencil and fixed the rest so that it was not noticed by the guard when I returned it, pencils being only loaned for each time. On scraps of paper I wrote the various points </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font15"> had brought out since 1950. These another sister was able to get Into the hands of our brothers. How happy they were to receive these! It being against the rules to talk to others, I had to be very careful when telling these things to my sisters by word of mouth. Time and again 1 was called up for breaking the rules, which gave me many opportunities to witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;[ &quot;As time went on more Witnesses were sent to this prison, forty brothers coming at one time. Because of refusing to help build a military airport they were placed under severe restrictions. One day I was able to steal to where they were, other sisters standing guard for me, and the first thing they asked me was, ‘Do you have any food? We are starving!’ Meaning, of course, spiritual food. I asked them about the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">kalfaktoren </span><span class="font15">(trusties) and learned that they were fine and respected the Witnesses for their stand. &lt;, &quot;From our windows we could daily see the male prisoners as they marched for exercise, and how we wanted to know which ones were Witnesses! So we arranged by means of a trusty that when marching the Witnesses would tug at their collars and we would do the same. The next day we sisters watched eagerly as group after group appeared, and then suddenly a group came in, all of whom began fiddling with their collars. We did the same from our windows, and how all faces beamed as we recognized each other!</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt; &quot;As time went on, however, we saw that our brothers were getting thinner and thinner till we could hardly stand to see it any more. At the time each of us sisters was receiving dally 500 grams, more than a pound, of bread. There being twenty-four of us, we were able to save from ten to twelve pounds a day. Then each morning on the way to the workshop, which was located in the men’s building, several of us would hide bread in our blouses and aprons and hand it to the trusties in charge of our brothers who gave it to them. To get away with this we had to be first in line, work very fast and have several rather heavy sisters plodding behind us who so slowed up the line that our guards did not note what was going on. The trusties got a big kick out of it and the brothers answered With beaming faces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;L &quot;A religiously prejudiced prisoner found out about </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">this and reported us. Repercussions </span><span class="font15">followed but the head matron did not report us to the top officials, for she greatly respected us. Gradually we again secretly supplied our brothers with bread. One morning I decided to take the bull by the horns, as it were. On the way to the workshop I approached one of the more friendly guards with a smile (he was known to have a weakness for the ladies), and said: 'We have some bread left, sir. Would you be so kind as to give it to our brothers In cells 10, 11 and 12?’ With a knowing grin he called some trusties and had them bring it to our brothers. In a few minutes he came to my workshop and said: ‘They send their greetings and heartfelt thanks.' We could hardly restrain our laughter nor our enemies their rage. After that we could help our brothers openly, nor did a single guard refuse to co-operate with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;, &quot;Upon their severe restrictions being lifted we were able to help our brothers far more. We kept sharing spiritual food with each other and that right under the very noses of the guards by being alert and sagacious. For almost two years we did this without their finding it out. It seems that I never experienced Jehovah’s presence as much as I did while in prison. At times things worked out most wonderfully. Last summer at the Frankfort assembly it was a real joy to see one to whom I witnessed while in prison being baptized.”—R. L.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">(CUEY there, what’re you doing?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">D &quot;We’s makin’ a kill.” A heated face appeared above the back fencing of the lot behind the house, and then an invitation was given to come in and see how the “kill” or kiln was being constructed. The lot itself was about forty feet by sixty feet, with houses all around, the inhabitants apparently undisturbed by this activity. Here was being made a charcoalburning kiln. It would be about ten feet wide and fifteen feet long, roughly oval in shape. Yvcsl ot tYie Yrasfrarih and Wile making it had dug out a small area, and over this hole had built a cairn of large stones that would support the heap above it and enable a fire to be lit down under the whole construction</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The cleared area, naturally very rocky and stony, was now spread over with wood. What kind of wood, you ask? Old timber from pulled-down structures, planks useful for nothing else, boughs from nearby trees and anything and everything that could be called wood. Usually this bottom layer is made up of the sturdier pieces of plank, even trunks of small trees, that will give support to the pile above it. With this first layer down, the couple shovel earth over the whole thing. Mopping heated brows, they took a breather. Then came a foraging expedition to collect more wood. This time it was bush and boughs from nearby trees, and many neighbor children could share in this and receive a few pennies in reward. That was about enough for one day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Next day the piling up continued. Another layer of earth on the boughs, another layer of wood, until the mound was about four feet high, topped with earth. The lighting of it necessitated paper,</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">small sticks and. of. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hate/g</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">used in the hole left near the ground at one end. When it was truly alight, the opening was covered over with more stones so the fire would not burn too fast and make ashes instead Of charcoal of the wood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Returning about five days later, we found the smoke lazily ascending from the middle of the kiln. The fire had slowly worked its way from the end where it had been lit along to the center part. Another four days or so and. the fire will be</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">the far end, and then it would go out. Several days must elapse for the whole thing to cool down, and then would come the uncovering. This was hard, dirty work. The couple started shoveling off some of the dirt, looking over each heap to pick out by hand the lumps of charcoal, mostly fist-sized or smaller, according to the size of the boughs or planks that had gone into the making of the kiln- Much AwpWip,, TrmrJn shoveling, paining backs and broken nails, together with much ' sweat, are required to reap the rewards of the burning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Two days’ work by two people went into the making of the kiln, and another two days to open it and take out its “black gold,” as well as days of vigilance in between. Skill and familiarity with the work mean that seldom does anything go wrong, but it could. The fire might burn too fast, or so slowly that it would go out too soon. It has to be just right, with sufficient wood and air and enough earth in the layers between. The fire can be controlled either by opening the vent to let in more air, thus hastening combustion, or by pouring water over the whole thing to slow it down. With little or no soil here in the Bahama Islands, which are mostly coral, earth is at a premium. It had to be transported into this yard in the first place, but at least it can be used over and over again. Additionally, in between kiln-making the soil can be used to grow things, and it is much more fertile as a result of its burning.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19581222_files/g_E_19581222-13.png" alt="" style="width:260pt;height:125pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">From that kiln came about seven containers of charcoal lumps, each with a capacity of about nine cubic feet. This is sold to the people of the neighborhood for l/6d (20c) a small bucketful, or else in small sacks for 4/- (56c). Those who buy sacks are the better-situated householders or people who have little shops and sell charcoal to others who buy it in even smaller quantities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">As we were</span><span class="font16"> about to leave, a friend that I took along to see this kiln asked: “But why do they need so much charcoal? I wouldn’t have thought that there would be so many outdoor barbecues around here.” “Barbecues? It is not made for barbecues but for everyday living. Everyone around here uses it every day, day by day. Come, let us ask the owner to show us how she uses it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The kitchen was a small wooden building separate from the house—this to keep the heat of the cooking from the living quarters. Here was an oven with some appetizing loaves already baking. It stood three feet high and was nothing more than a wooden crate with a door hung in front of it on hinges. Opening the oven, we could see that it was lined with tin and had a rack halfway up from the bottom on which were the pans of bread. Under the rack was an iron cup-shaped stove filled with blazing charcoal, burning with little smoke and giving out a very efficient heat. That bread smelled delicious and we only wished it was ready, since the householder hospitably said she would like us to have had a taste of it newly baked. We were told that nearly all the people in the vicinity cook that way, though a few use oil stoves. Many cook that way because they prefer it, as well as because it is more economical. Then we had demonstrated to us another use for charcoal—the ironing “goose.” The heavy iron has a funnel, much the same shape as a ship’s ventilator, coming out of the front of it. Into this are poked a few pieces of burning charcoal, with more fresh charcoal added as needed. The iron soon gets hot, and this heat is maintained for a much longer time than a heated flatiron, as it has its own kind of internal combustion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“What an eye-opener!” said my companion as we thanked the owner and left. “I had no idea about any of those things until today. I had no knowledge of how charcoal Is made, nor of how it is used, nor of how much it is used. It is good.for all of us to see a little more into how others in the world live.” Yes, to know more is to understand people better, and when we realize the hard work that goes into the making of a kiln and getting the charcoal from it, it makes us appreciate not only the resourcefulness of the people but also the resources erf our earth.</span></p><img src="g_E_19581222_files/g_E_19581222-14.png" alt="" style="width:199pt;height:120pt;">
<p><span class="font23">O</span><span class="font16">NE of the basic truths stated in the Bible is the one written at 1 Timothy 2:3-6, which reads: “This is right and acceptable in the sight of our Savior, God, whose will is that all kinds of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth. For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, a man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a corresponding ransom for all—this is what is to be witnessed to at its own particular times.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Does this scripture state that all humankind, regardless of their will, deeds and desires, will be saved in due time? Since the Bible says Christ Jesus gave himself &quot;a corresponding ransom for all,” does this mean that wicked men and even the Devil will have the full benefit of Christ’s ransom?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It must be acknowledged that some of the human race, the offspring of the first man Adam, are willfully wicked. These men are quite satisfied with their wicked state in life. They have no desire or inclination to be different. They enjoy being what they are—wicked. Does the ransom save these? Are such ones benefited by the ransom? Or must one first comply with God’s rules concerning the ransom? The apostle Peter wrote: “Jehovah is not slow respecting his promise, as some people consider slowness, but he is patient with you because he does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.” This repentance is necessary for salvation. It enables a person to come into a position where the ransom can operate with value toward such a one. The unrepentant are unransomable. From this we learn that certain requirements must be met before the ransom price is operative toward one, that the unrepentant sinner remains in his sins. And “the wages sin pays is death.”—2 Pet. 3:9; Rom. 6:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">What must be done to receive of the ransom benefits? The first thing to be done is to turn from one’s former course of conduct. There must be a conversion in the heart and mind to the will of God, a turning around, so to speak. If one refuses to make this change, he remains in his sins. Note what the Bible says: “As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked tum from his way and live: tum ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die?”—Ezek. 33:11, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">This turning away from evil must be done in a very literal and real way. It is a serious business with Jehovah and it should also be to men, because it is a matter of life or death. The choice is man’s to make. Jehovah says: “When I say unto the wicked, Thou shaft surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which Is lawful and right; if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that which he had taken by robbery, walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die. None of his sins that he hath committed shall be remembered against him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.” Such one lives because he has placed himself under the ransom and its arrangement for salvation of men. He lives in God’s sight in a spiritual sense, and under God’s kingdom he will receive life in all its fullness—everlasting life.—Ezek. 33:14-16, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Since man can place himself under the ransom and its provisions, man can also take himself out from under the ransom and its provisions. How? The Bible answers: “When the righteous tumeth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die therein. And when the wicked tumeth from his wickedness, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.” So it is by our life course, by our appreciation of Jehovah’s provision, that we place ourselves under the ransom arrangement. By our deliberately acting contrary to Jehovah’s commandments, we take ourselves out from under this precious, life-giving provision, the ransom.—Ezek. 33:18, 19, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The “all” of mankind that are going to taste of the ransom provision are those who come to know God and Christ and abide by righteous principles. All others remain outside this saving arrangement. Jesus said that God gave him authority over all flesh so that he may give those whom the Father has given him everlasting life. “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” At the time that Jesus prayed these words to God, only a small remnant of faithful disciples Ijad been given to Jesus by the Father. To these Jesus purposed to give everlasting life, and to all others whom God should yet give him. According to this prayer, those persons who refuse to know Jehovah and his Son Christ Jesus cannot receive everlasting life. —John 17:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Many persons to whom Bible truths are presented and who are shown God’s provision for everlasting life spurn it. What reason is there to believe Adam will receive of the ransom provision? To give him the benefit of the ransom sacrifice would mean that God would thereby show that his judgment against Adam in Eden was not an altogether just one; whereas Psalm 89:14 plainly says: “Righteousness and judgment are the established place of your throne.” To grant all of Adam’s offspring the benefit of the ransom when many of these spurn it, thrust it aside, is wholly inconsistent with God’s purpose expressed in the Bible. At Matthew 20:28 Jesus said that he came “to give his soul a ransom in exchange for many,” not everybody. The “many” are those who obey him, as Paul stated regarding Jesus: “He became responsible for everlasting salvation to all those obeying him.”—Heb. 5:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">At 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20 it is written: “You do not belong to yourselves, for you were bought with a price.” Peter adds; “It was with precious blood, like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb, even Christ’s.” Some misconstrue this scripture to mean that it takes along with these Christians purchased every individual of the human family and that these are automatically bought. Not so. No one is ransomed against his will. Only those that desire to be ransomed or purchased are. These must become dedicated footstep followers of Christ Jesus,—1 Pet. 1:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The conditions on which one may benefit from the ransom are exactly the same toward all. The wicked are not purchased, because they do not first consent. Satan the Devil and his demons are not ransomed, because the ransom is for men, not angels. Some who have consented to be bought afterward turned back to their former ways and in this way renounced the purchase price. There will never be a repurchase of them; Hence only destruction awaits them.—Heb. 10:26, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The purpose and provision of God is to redeem men without discrimination as to nationality, color or language. But these men must be men of faith wholly dedicated to the will of God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">&lt;$&gt; Two female monkeys housed In the nose cone of a Jupiter missile developed by the U.S. Army survived a flight through space on May 28. Abel, a 7-pound rhesus monkey, and Baker, a squirrel monkey weighing only one pound, traveled in specially equipped capsules in the missile’s nose cone. They sped through space at about 10,000 miles an hour, reaching an al-t i t u d e of approximately 300 miles. The 15-minute trip covered a distance of 1,700 miles from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to a point in the Caribbean where the cone and its occupants were retrieved. Attached to the monkeys’ bodies were telemetering devices that relayed data on the effects of acceleration, weightlessness and deceleration as the simian astronauts made their space flight. Both did &quot;remarkably well,&quot; according to reports. The Soviets announced last year that two dogs had been sent to an altitude of 281 miles in a straight up-and-down rocket trip and that they had returned unharmed. Sputnik II carried its canine passenger, Laika, in an orbit with a high point of about 1,000 miles, but the dog died after a week aloft. Russia has never reported an experiment comparable to the monkey space flight.</span></p>

About two months earlier Adenauer had agreed to run for the Bonn presidency. Now with a &quot;deterioration of the international situation” the 83-year-old statesman withdrew his candidacy for the West German presidency and declared that he would retain the chancellorship. Though there was some criticism of Adenauer’s decision, the Christian Democratic Union granted him &quot;unqualified” endorsement. Adenauer cited the deadlock at the Geneva conference of foreign ministers as an example of the worsening international situation prompting his decision to remain as West German chancellor,</span></p>

It was held that Nationalist China “no longer represents sports in the entire country of China.” The 1960 Winter Olympic Games are scheduled to begin at Squaw Valley, California, on February 18. Even if Communist China were to apply for and receive Olympic status before then, it would be too late for Its competitors to participate in the 1960 Winter Games. On June 8 the Chinese Nationalists applied for readmission in the movement as the Republic of China Olympic Committee.</span></p>

Even the Russian humor magazine </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Krokodil,</span><span class="font15"> in its issue of June 1, abandoned customary frivolity to launch out against the Witnesses in the U.S.S.R. Two pages replete with pictures were devoted to the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses in the Soviet Union. The report held that &quot;anti-Soviet literature,” which had been hidden in such unlikely places as hollowed-out bedposts and hollow logs, had been turned up while search was made of homes of suspected Witnesses. The periodical said, among other things, that copies of </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font15"> the magazine used by Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide in their Bible-study and preaching activities, had been reproduced on a small proof press. Kro-</span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">kodU</span><span class="font15"> proceeded to cast aspersions on known Witnesses, alleging that they had undesirable backgrounds. Soviet Witnesses are connected with the world headquarters situated in Brooklyn, New York, which, according to the Soviet organ, controls a great earthencircling spy network. &quot;We must not only oust these spiders,” said </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Krokodil,</span><span class="font15"> “we must also disinfect against them.

The results of the current election differed very little from those of the 1955 vote. At that time the Christian Democrats won 37 seats, the Communists 20 and the Socialists 10. During the recent vote Communists and fellow travelers received considerable backing despite efforts by the Roman Catholic Church to reduce It and to gain support for the Christian Democrats.</span></p>

Half of the 250 seats in the upper chamber of the Japanese Diet, or parliament, are voted on every three years. Two vacancies, caused by death, brought the number of contestants up to 127. The Liberal-Democrats, headed by klshi, won 71 seats, bringing their total to 132.

Summerfield to prominent individuals around the world were carried by a Regulus guided missile. The vehicle, a pilotless plane that flies about 600 miles an hour, was launched from the deck of a submarine 100 miles out in the Atlantic. It landed at Mayport Naval Auxiliary Air Station near Jacl&amp;onville, Florida, and from there the letters went </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">on their way by</span><span class="font15"> ordinary means.

Actually, missile mail Sights are not new. Back in 1935, 189 messages, along with a live cock and a hen, made a missile flight. In a similar category may be placed the German V-l and V-2 rockets, which carried propaganda leaflets over England and France during World War n, as well as Communist leaflet-bearing missiles sent from East Germany to West Germany.</span></p>

Violators would receive heavy </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">fines or one-year jail </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sen</span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">tences</span><span class="font15"> as penalties. The curbs went into effect while constitutional talks proceeded in Djakarta’s Constituent Assembly. Prior to leaving for a world tour in April, Indonesia’s President Sukarno asked for a return to the 1945 revolutionary constitution. This would grant him near-dictatorial powers and would permit him to proceed with his “guided democracy&quot; plan for the Republic’s administration without interference. Three successive assembly votes, however, rebuffed the Sukarno bid for vast powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">New </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">state of Singapore</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Singapore became an autonomous state oh June 3. In elections held earlier on May 30, 35 of the 51 seats in the new Legislative Assembly went to the left-wing People's Action party headed by Lee Kuan Yew. Control of the State of Singapore’s defense and foreign affairs still rests </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">with the British.</span><span class="font15"> A “future Socialist society” has been promised by the party. Though pro-Communist elements exist within its ranks, Prime Minister Lee maintains that his party “does not propose to be, or even appear to be, the handmaid of the Communist Party.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Unrest In Ecuador</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">In late May military recruits at Portoviejo, Ecuador, demonstrated against alleged mistreatment by army officers. Rioting also swept through Guayaquil on June 2 and 3. Disturbances there had begun as a student protest, but a wave of looting followed. Though martial law was imposed, rioting continued and before order was completely restored about 150 persons had been injured and over 20 had been killed. Blame for the violence was laid to &quot;elements foreign to Ecuador” and the government reportedly held that the unrest had been Communist-inspired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Cuban Land Law</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;$&gt; Five ministers resigned from the Cuban cabinet on June 12. The resignations had apparently come as a result of disagreement over the island’s new Agrarian Reform Law, though various other administrative policies were also said to have caused controversy. Premier Fidel Castro’s new plan bars aliens from either ownership or inheritance of land on the island. Additionally, property holdings by a single company or individual may not exceed 1,000 acres. Compensation for lands expropriated by the government Is to be based on tax-assessed property values, and payment will be made by means of 20-year peso bonds carrying 5 percent interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Term “Boy” Offensive</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&amp; For years many white persons throughout East Central and South Africa have applied the term &quot;boy” to African males. This has been so regardless of age and not just with reference to servants. The practice has often been offensive to the African, so much so, in fact, that the use of the word &quot;boy” in this way will be on the agenda of next year’s London meeting on the constitutional status of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Riding on Air</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&amp; On June 11 a strange new vehicle made an appearance in The Solent off the Isle of Wight, south of England. Named the Hovercraft, the conveyance skirted over the water on a cushion of air. It was constructed by Saunders-Roe, Ltd., and Is capable of traveling on both sea and land. Cylindrical in shape, the Hovercraft has a diameter of 30 feet and weighs about four tons. The vehicle cleared the water by about one foot as it moved along at approximately 25 knots. It has a 435-horse-power engine that generates the air that bears it up by means of a large fan in a funnel on its underside. Small air jets provide for the craft’s forward motion. Air-cushioned land and sea craft are not new, but in the U.S., for example, security measures have prevented the divulging of technical details about such vehicles.</span></p>
