</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">NEVER, not in all history, was there a time when the cry for peace was louder than it is today. The groaning masses of mankind who hate suffered and survived two global wars desire peace more than anything else. Widows, after losing their husbands in World War I, worked and struggled to raise their infant sons only to see them cut down in World War II. They hate war. Old men who returned as disabled veterans from the first world war cursed the nations when they rearmed for the second all-out death struggle. They abhor war. Innocent children, young men and fair maidens who never tasted the bitter waters of the first global war were baptized in the raging seas of the second. They detest war. Not only from the lips of these crippled casualties of former wars, but also from those who yet have their youth and vitality, comes the united, plea for peace. It is not an exaggeration to say that more than ninety-nine percent of the people hate war for what it is, desire peace, and long to see the final beating of “swords into plowshares”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the face of these facts is it not indeed strange to see the whole world preparing for war on a greater scale than ever before? The banner of philosophy that is held high today, not so much by the warmongers as it is by the peace planners, is this: “If we want peace we must prepare for war.” What a paradoxical and contradictory situation I The most fearful and frightened ones that cry the loudest for peace are also the ones that are the most hysterical about all-out preparation for war. Devout lovers of peace become bewildered. A feverish frenzy overtakes them. The rising tide sweeps them along. And, as if some unseen Satanic force were behind them, they find themselves pushing the “preventive war” program to the limit. Everywhere and from all quarters come the screaming proclamations: “Prepare for war! Wake up the mighty military men! Give the youth universal military training 1 Mobilize the manpower! Draft industry 1 Stock-pile resources! Push scientific research, and develop new and more terrible weapons! This is the road to peace!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Instead of this being the road that will ultimately lead them to the good end of fulfilling the Bible prophecy of Seating swords into plowshares’, as they claim, it sweeps them along another road, to the fulfillment of an exactly opposite Bible prophecy:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">up: BEAT YOUR PLOWSHARES INTO SWORDS, and </span><span class="font11">your pruninghooks into spears: lei the weak say, I am strong. Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about.—Joel 3:9-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In December 1946 the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a disarmament resolution. But that is as far as the matter went. People ask why. It is a time to prepare for war, and mighty unseen forces have been at work to prevent disarmament. Take, for example, the United States. Pressure from public opinion caused the discarding of many engines of war and battle wagons, and the discharging of many troops, during the first few months after hostilities ceased. Now we are told that this was a mistake. Rearm! is the cry.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19480608_files/g_E_19480608-3.png" alt="" style="width:53pt;height:53pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">In March of this year the stage was set for an all-out drive. The air was heavily charged with electrical tension. The “war of nerves” had seen to this. Too, a highly secretive meeting on March 11-14 was held at Key West, Fla., where the august personages of the joint chiefs of staff discussed plans for the future conduct of wars. An emergency was at hand. A ''great crisis” had arisen. A “fateful” hour. What next? The suspense was terrific 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">An announcement. The president of the United States would address a joint session of Congress on March 17. The night before tension was further increased. The president was holding intensive meetings with members of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">his </span><span class="font12">cabinet and his top advisers on foreign affairs. And, as if to temper the House of Representatives for the blast that would fall upon them the next day, the speaker of the house, Martin, on March 16, declared:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We must build up our military and naval establishments. We must build and main tain a mighty air defense. We must have the strongest navy on the seas. We must make ourselves absolutely supreme in the air and under the seas. In this issue, where the fate of civilization is at stake, we must spare no effort to be sure of the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Prepare War”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">‘7 am here,” Truman began, “to recommend action.” He was speaking not only to the joint session of Congress but to the greatest invisible radio audience assembled since V-E day. Continuing, Truman said that although nearly three -years had passed since the end of the last war “peace and stability have not returned to the world”, in spite of the fact that “conference after conference has been held in different parts of the-world”. Therefore, he was now recommending “action”. “Time,” he said, “is now of critical importance.” Once launching this “guided missile”, it was now time to explode it where it would our the most damage to the road block that had obstructed military preparation. Pulling the fuse, Truman demanded both “prompt enactment of universal training legislation” and the adoption of an emergency draft. Then, as if to add powerful logic to the initial puff of oratory, frightened Truman said: “We have learned the importance of maintaining </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">military strength as a means of preventing</span><span class="font12"> war. We have found that a sound military system is necessary in time of peace if we are to remain at peace.” And, furthermore, “We cannot meet our international responsibilities unless we maintain our armed forces,” he said. In conclusion, Truman again rang the alarm bell in an effort to arouse the lawmakers to the necessity of preparing for war: “The recommendations I have made represent the most urgent steps toward securing the peace and preventing war. . . . With God’s help we shall succeed.”</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19480608_files/g_E_19480608-4.png" alt="" style="width:55pt;height:53pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">While Truman, in his speech, did not declare war on Soviet Russia, or proclaim a state of emergency, the effect was almost the same. Rushing from the chambers of Congress, Truman flew to New York, where he reviewed a “St. Patrick’s” parade, and made another speech, which was a repeat performance of the one given before Congress. Meantime General Marshall, the secretary of state, was pushing the campaign on another front. In less than two hours from the time Truman shot off his volley in</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Congress, Marshall was firing another into the Senate Armed Services Committee, in which speech he said bluntly: “Diplomatic action, without the backing of military strength in the present world, can lead only to appeasement.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The switch had been thrown, and across the, nation and in the capitals of the world the editorial rooms of the publicity agents were again buzzing with the same activity that won them medals in World War II. The press and radio machines ground out their inflammatory propaganda at high speed. “The nation,” said the Minneapolis </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune,</span><span class="font12"> “needs to strengthen its armed forces with men trained and available for services where-ever needed.&quot; Wrote </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Constitution</span><span class="font12"> of Atlanta, Ga.: “We believe the Congress should unite for the emergency as it did in war, and that we should prepare the, nation with all necessary weapons and research.” “Perpetual and invincible readiness for war appears to be our current destiny,” said the Seattle </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Times. </span><span class="font12">“The tide is running fast in world affairs,” is the way the New York </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font12">put it; hence, “we can ride it or be overwhelmed by it. The choice is ours to make.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The louder one shouts in a dank, dark cavern the louder and more numerous the echoes. This is the principle that explains why the repercussions from the March 17 explosion are still heard around the world. Big voices, like those of the former associate justice of the supreme court, Owen J. Roberts, and Dr, Karl T. Compton, president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, boomed forth urging universal training. Presidential aspirant, Governor Thomas E. Dewey, echoed that there should “be an immediate and large increase in our air forces&quot;. Senator Taft, another presidential hopeful, urged rearming the nation for defense. The former secretary of state, James F. Byrnes, crying out for rearmament, asked: “Are we going to prepare?” In answer he moaned: “I hope so. I pray so.” Joseph C. Grew, former undersecretary of state, striking a pious posture with folded hands, sighed: “Let us pray to Providence . . . that the rebuilding of that military power will not come too late.” One of the huskiest voices heard croaking for military preparedness is that of Bernard M. Baruch, who outlines the following system for immediate adoption:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A system of industrial mobilization with priorities, allocations, and rationing powers; a ceiling over all prices, wages and rents, to prevent inflation; taxation to take the profit out of war; the accumulation of strategic raw materials which may he lacking or in short supply; a work-or-fight wartime draft; the organization of pools of labor of all kinds and in all professions and sciences; intensified scientific research; .expanded intelligence and information services; retention of war plants in stand-by readiness; the decentralization of industry to guard against an over-concentration which could be a strategic liability; up-to-date surveys of underground industrial facilities,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Wake Up the Mighty Men”</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19480608_files/g_E_19480608-5.png" alt="" style="width:73pt;height:72pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">“Prepare war.” The peril is great. Action, and that quickly. There is no time to lose. Arouse the leaders, not only in the political, but also in the commercial, religious, educational and social fields. Wake up the mighty military men. “Let all the men of war draw near.” War, war, war, and still more war! That must become the fear and the talk of the people. Call in the propaganda boys and let them advertise it. Sell this idea to all lovers of peace! Whoop it up loud and long, and they will expect war in a matter of months or, at the most, within a few years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">And so it is, from every source great torrents of war talk have poured forth to drown and wash out opposition, and to carry before it the masses of people and their public opinion. Books are written to arouse the people. Full-page advertisements are carried in leading newspapers, advocating military preparedness and supremacy, not only on land and sea, but also in the air. The ether waves of radio are likewise used to bombard the eardrums with the same ballyhoo. Those that refuse to be awakened by this noisy flood of talk and publicity are dubbed, to quote the Washington </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Star,</span><span class="font12"> “sleepwalkers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But the patriotic organizations will show the world they are no sleepwalkers. They hear Truman’s bugle call for action, and so they are among the first to climb on board the bandwagon by adopting resolutions, circulating petitions and, in other ways, advocating rearmament and universal military preparedness. The American Legion, the Jewish War Veterans and others, to hear their official leaders tell it (for the rank and file have no say), are taking the lead in crying “Wolfl Wolf!” Right behind them come other chorus boys singing the same refrain. The New York State Association for Health, Physical Education and Recreation calls out for “preparedness for the preservation </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font12"> national security”. Columbia University Professor George S. Counts avers that democracy must “marshal all of its moral and intellectual resources” if it hopes to survive, since “education is a weapon”.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19480608_files/g_E_19480608-6.png" alt="" style="width:59pt;height:69pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">The “mighty men” that wear the consecrated garb of religion are also awakening, as the trumpet call for war continues to sound. Beating their breasts with a great outward display of loyalty, they endeavor to mobilize their following. Five clergymen make a big splash on the front page of the San Francisco </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Examiner,</span><span class="font12"> declaring, in the words of one of them: “The purpose of universal military training is to prepare to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">prevent </span><span class="font12">war.” All of them were in favor of the military program. The day after Truman’s “preparedness address”, under the headline “Vatican Acclaims Speech of</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Truman”, the New York </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font12"> reported : “Rome, March 18—</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">L'Osservatore Romano gave</span><span class="font12"> today wholehearted approval to President Truman’s speech.” Hailing the' speech </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">D'Osservatore Romano</span><span class="font12"> said it was a “political ultimatum” that may “usher in a new prewar phase consisting of war-like mobilizations and preparations”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When it comes to slinging the showy oratory none seem more qualified than Cardinal Spellman. In the presence of Truman and other dignitaries who attended the St. Patrick’s day assembly, distressed Spellman relieved himself of the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I hate war. And it is because I our hate war that I must put my trust in- men who know better than I the dangers that beset America; and, if these men chosen by the vote and confidence of the American people believe preparedness will prevent war, then I, who love America better than I love my life, cast my vote, as a private American citizen, for universal military training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Brass and Braid our the Bossing</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Being a time for preparing war, the Big Brass has moved in and taken over the reins of government policy. Not in numbers, but in key positions graduates of the military colleges 'are able to muster the military strength of the nation. A new secretary of state is needed; General Marshall, army chief of staff, takes over the job. He is given a medal, declaring him “at the helm in peace as in war”. And, as a publicity stunt, he is photographed on bended knee at a Catholic mass. A super military boss is needed. No trouble, just create a new cabinet post and put James V. Forrestal in it, with the title “secretary of defense”. Under him many militarists find jobs in key positions in the government—planning, policy, organization, operation. Ambassadors are needed. Send Lieut. Gen. Walter Bedell Smith to Russia, Brig. Gen. Frank T. Hines to Panama, Gen. Thomas Holcomb to South Africa, Adm. Alan G. Kirk to Belgium. Governors of occupation are needed. Send Lieut. Gen. Lucius</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">D. Clay to Germany, Lieut. Gen. Geoffrey Keyes to Austria, and Gen. Douglas MacArthur to Japan. Special missions are needed to investigate and advise in different theaters. To our this job some thirteen military missions are scattered throughout South America, besides those in Greece, Turkey and other countries in Europe and the Far East. Other Brass and Braid march under other civil titles, as, for example, Robert Pell of the war department goes along as an “adviser” with Myron C. Taylor when he pays a social call on Franco and Pope Pius. These, of course, are very few of the expanding list of military “Who’s Who” who are in the saddle now running the government</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Plowshares into Swords’*</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">And why are all the mighty military men taking the lead ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the open field of govern-</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">K^HagBrnent? Are they out there KBBSjl leading a clean-up campaign, gathering up all the broken swords of past battles in order that such may be beaten into peaceful plowshares? They are in a scrap-iron campaign all right, but it is one that is gathering the plowshares in order that they may be forged into new and more terrible weapons than heretofore seen on any battlefield. But don’t worry, we are told they are weapons of peace. Why, who would dare think otherwise after what the propaganda agencies have told us?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The war plants may have shut down after World War II, but that, it seems, was only to allow them to retool. Research and experiments with new weapon models have been going on apace, and now, with the stepped-up program for rearmament, Congress is asked to appropriate billions, not millions but billions of dollars, for the production of these weapons. As matters now stand $46,000,000,000 is asked for military purposes for the next three years 1 Two hundred government war plants are to be 'reconditiohed**just in case”. A survey of 22,000 other plants is now being made to alert them for a moment’s change-over.</span></p>

And they will have a speed heretofore unknown. And then there are the heinous weapons which employ deadly bacteria and special strains of virus for the use in “BW” (bacteria warfare). “A&quot; is for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">atom, </span><span class="font12">this military age teaches, and the ‘■piece-makers” love to play with them. And so they are making “bigger and better” A-bombs. And A-clouds, also. If you have not heard, atom clouds are radioactive and are said to be more deadly than the atom bomb. A pleasant peace thought! But those of the “old school” who love their TNT are now dropping 42,000-pound bombs experimentally in California, just to see what happens. Other busy military boys are testing out sound waves that produce such intense heat that it is “hoped” they will be able to kill humans.

<p><span class="font12">The United States is not rearming in order to conquer the world. Not at all. The whole world is rearming. It is a race, not to see which nation wins by getting ahead, but rather, we are told, it is a race to see which nation loses by failing behind. Consequently, the nations of this wicked world are united in becoming a “one world” army camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Five nations sign Europe’s postWorld War II military alliance: Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Great Britain. Poland, China, Greece and France pass draft laws. In fact, while the United States debates the issue, universal military training is practically “universal&quot; in Europe. Tension grows. Sweden, Canada and France step up their military preparedness programs. Britain too is concerned. More arms are asked for Greece, Turkey and China. Argentina gets the jitters and orders 1,000 more planes. Italy, spoiled by the war, is now rebuilding her navy. And every one knows the mighty men of Moscow are awake and in the race. 'One report says Russia’s war production is now turning at the 1940 speed. Another report says she is spending oneeighth of her gross income for defense, to compare with a U. S. A. expenditure of one-sixteenth for the same purpose. There is even talk of giving the United Nations a military horse, called a “foreign legion”, so it can compete with the others in the race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">It is all as foretold: &quot;Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about.” (Joel 3:11) It is exactly as foreseen by the apostle John (Revelation 16:13-16): &quot;Ana i saw ruree ’unclean spirits like frogs ... for <sub>;</sub> they are the spirits, of devils, working<sup>1</sup> miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. . . . And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.”</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">In this prophecy of Revelation is revealed the inspired talk mustering the world for war. The peoples of earth do not want it, yet propaganda or “unclean spirits” issued by the organization of Satan the Devil, the “god of this world” (2 Corinthians 4:4), move the leaders of this world’s visible organizations toward total war. Actually, they herd the nations toward a clash with God on the battlefield of Armageddon. There all militarism will end, along with visible and invisible wicked ones, including man’s chief enemy, Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Thereafter, under the righteous rule of God’s promised. Theocratic kingdom the survivors will finally beat “swords into plowshares” and “spears into prun-inghooks”, for “nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more”.—Micah 4: 3.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">television in the Theaters</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On the evening of April 14 a surprised audience at the Paramount theater, Broadway and Forty-third, saw a “sneak preview” of television on the motion picture screen. Three rounds of boxing were televised from Brooklyn to the top of the Daily </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">News </span><span class="font9">building on east Forty-second street, then relayed to the top of the Paramount building. Paramount has a special film recorder that almost instantly transposes television reception onto the standard 35 mm, film used in the usual motion picture projection machine. From the time a punch was swung in the Brooklyn fight ring till it was seen on the Paramount screen, only 66 seconds elapsed. The pictures on the screen were for the most part of good definition and brightness, with only slight fuzziness noticeable onee or twice in one corner of the screen. The expressions of the fighters were clearly conveyed on the large-size images, 18 by 24 feet. Paul Raibourn, in charge of Paramount’s television activities, hopes to regularly pick up news events, and possibly even make a bid for theater televising of the coming Louis-Wolcott heavyweight championship bout.</span></p>

<p><span class="font23" style="font-variant:small-caps;">H</span><span class="font16" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ypocrisy </span><span class="font12">is hated by all honest men. But hypocrites often gain the approval of honest men deceived by a camouflage of words. Some hypocrites are such by deliberate design. Others are blind to their own hypocrisy through ignorance of the inconsistency of their words and acts. A loud tongue is often proved a lying tongue by the acts of the one who wags it. This was illustrated in the United States during the month of April, when self-proclaimed Christians and patriots performed acts that called them hypocrites instead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Attention settles on Parkersburg, West Virginia. There twelve war veterans’ organizations are represented by a Veterans Council, chairman of which is R. Tracy Evans. Evans declared that the Veterans Council represents 6,000 veterans in that vicinity. Through their mouthpiece Evans the organization makes loud claims of Americanism and boasts of its religious tolerance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Now there looms up on the local scene an event that calls for protest and action by patriotic persons, according to the Veterans Council. Jehovah’s witnesses, Christian ministers, are to meet there on April 23-25, and arrangements provide for their meetings to be held on Friday and Saturday and Sunday morning in the Y.M.C.A., and on Sunday afternoon in the Jefferson school auditorium. But to allow to this minority group-freedom of speech and worship and assembly would be unpatriotic, according to R. Tracy Evans, Veterans Council chairman. Hence he took what he considered patriotic steps to choke off these freedoms for this particular minority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Veterans Council through Evans protested to the Y.M.C.A. for allowing Jehovah’s witnesses to meet there, but the pressure methods did not intimidate the general secretary of the Y.M.C.A. Nor did they work when applied against superintendent of schools Lloyd H. Wharton, when Evans protested to him about Jehovah’s witnesses’ use of the Jefferson school auditorium for the Sunday afternoon public Bible lecture. According to the Parkersburg </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Sentinel, </span><span class="font12">April 24, Evans stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Veterans Council is definitely opposed to the use of this public school by any organization that would not put the welfare of its country above that of its own group in time of peril to, the nation. Members of this group preferred to spend their time in the safety of claiming to be conscientious objectors while other able-bodied men spent their time on the battle, fronts of the world. Any idea of religious intolerance in this matter is out of the question, because every religion is represented, except Jehovah’s witnesses, in the 12 war veterans’ organizations in the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Perhaps Evan’s patriotic hypocrisy comes through ignorance rather than design, since his statement is contrary to fact. Jehovah’s witnesses did not put the welfare of their group ahead of the country’s good, but they put God’s cause first. The most that an honest person might say was that the Witnesses put God ahead of the country. Any Christian would, when confronted with the choice. But even this would not be the true fact in this instance. The draft law of the land exempted ministers. Jehovah’s witnesses are ministers. They .were law-abiding in claiming exemption as ministers. The lawless ones were those that tried to force them into the army when the draft law of the land exempted them. When Evans speaks of Jehovah’s witnesses as claiming exemption as conscientious objectors he errs again, since their claimed exemption was based on the ministerial status, Andhe displays pathetic ignorance in logic when he seeks to'eliminate any charges of religions intolerance by claiming that every religion (a slight exaggeration?) is united in opposing Jehovah’s witnesses on this matter. If true, all this would logically prove is that religious intolerance was unanimous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But the facts argue that feeling against Jehovah’s witnesses was not so unanimous as Evans claimed, not even among the 6,000 veterans he represents. Even by radio his call went out to the community: “We want a mass meeting, a general muster of all veterans in uniform at Jefferson school at 1:30 p.m,” But on Sunday afternoon only a handful of rabble appeared in answer to their master’s voice. Local papers estimated 60 servicemen present, some uniformed, some in caps, some carrying flags. Sixty out of 6,000. Not very unanimous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Hundreds of townspeople gathered near by as curious onlookers. Tenseness increased as the Witnesses began arriving at 2 o’clock. Observers saw them walk the gantlet of veterans that lined both sides of the path leading into the auditorium. They heard Evans rouse the rabble to a higher pitch, by means of sound-car equipment. They heard the strains of “The Star Spangled Banner” played from the sound truck, and the taunts hurled at the Witnesses as they passed into the building. Cries of “Send them back to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Russia&quot; reflected </span><span class="font12">the typical stupidity of the mob mind. The onlookers saw the first violence when a trouble-maker struck a young lad on the chin. They saw others slapped and cuffed about, and Bible literature snatched from the Witnesses’ hands and burned. The climax came when those carrying flags marched from the' entrance shortly be-</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">rore a o'clock. This was apparently the signa! for the attack, as the<sup>11</sup> mobsters surged forward with cursings and shouts that they were coming in. But the hundreds of observers saw a small squad of Witnesses block the door and beat off the attackers. Into this melee of flying fists some 25 policemen flew to completely scatter the attackers. Some of the servicemen were treated for minor injuries at the hospital. Their </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">putsch</span><span class="font12"> failed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">After seeing and hearing the excitement outside the auditorium, the curious ones that had gathered, now over 1,000, heard the hour-long Bible lecture by means of a loud-speaker placed on the building for their convenience. Inside more than 500 other persons listened. The outcome was that more heard because of the opposition than would have without it. The gospel message was furthered. With the apostle Paul, each Witness there can joyfully say: “The things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel.”—Philippians 1:12,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fighters for Freedom</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Though the “things which happened” furthered the gospel, they did not advance American ideals. They constituted an assault upon freedom. But this initial assault was commendably turned back by superintendent of schools Wharton, who refused to break the contract with the Witnesses to eater to those that lipserve civil liberties while fighting against them. Also standing fast for freedoms was the general secretary of the Y.M.C.A., Walter Helfer. In the Parkersburg </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">News,</span><span class="font12"> April 25, he stated:</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19480608_files/g_E_19480608-9.png" alt="" style="width:328pt;height:198pt;">
<p><span class="font9">Armed veterans withdraw the colors, preliminary, to the rush by veterans to storm the meeting inside</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">“We’ve had other church groups here, and the Watchtower Society is holding its meetings just like any other group. We must be tolerant,” the general secretary continued. “This is a free country, and if we can’t stand people who don’t think like we do, we might as well close up. The Quakers and a good many ministers don’t believe in war and are not persecuted.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Y.M.C.A. general secretary described the family groups of men, women and children as one of the best-behaved assemblies ever to meet at the Y.M.C.A., and stated flatly : “I have no apologies for allowing them the use of the W’ facilities. I assume full responsibility, and would do the same again under the same circumstances.&quot; .'. . &quot;I believe this action of the veterans is very un-American. First we should be Christian in our own actions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">That, statement was made before the violence of Sunday. Afterward he expressed doubts that Evans “speaks for the majority of the veterans’ organizations”, adding: “What was done Sunday was mobocracy and not democracy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Walter Helfer’s doubts about Evans’ speaking for the veterans’ organizations seem well founded. The Amvets Post No, 19, on April 26, passed by a large majority a resolution “unequivocally condemning the attitude and actions of certain so-called veterans and their selfappointed leaders at the Jefferson school yesterday”. It declared that such methods are “in the best tradition of the police state, and make the ‘American way<sup>1</sup> a mockery”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Apparently some American Legionnaires were present to help break up the meeting on Sunday, but if they were it was not as representing Parkersburg Post No. 15 of the American Legion. At the earnest opportunity tms r'ost aiso adopted a resolution. Its preamble declared righteous and lawful principles of liberty and then condemned “certain individuals purporting to represent the Wood County Veterans Council” that voiced threats and later, on Sunday, April 25, “did perform and act in a manner most disgraceful.” This Legion Post “did not approve, sanction, ratify, or confirm any of the acts taken” and “none of its members took part therein, on behalf or under the authority of the American Legion”. In concluding it said: “Now, therefore, be it resolved, that the members of Parkersburg Post No. 15 of the American Legion deplore the entire incident.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">No hypocrisy in these words. They were backed up by vigorous action. During May, by ballot, R. Tracy Evans was ousted as head of the Veterans Council.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Recall that Evans claimed to be backed by “every religion” except Jehovah’s witnesses m his fight against freedom'? He again took too much for granted. On May 4 an alliance of ministers of Parkersburg and Wood county adopted a resolution' accusing the veterans of disturbing the peace and, by their methods of intimidation and violence, flagrantly violating the Constitution and using police-state tactics. The resolution did “emphatically condemn as unwise and un-American any and all efforts by any person or group of persons to take the law into their own hands”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Certainly deserving of commendation as fighters for freedom are Chief of Police Joseph Beckett and the some 25 officers present. They knew of the activity of the agitators, and they came prepared to frustrate any un-American action. They did just that. In addition to the uniformed officers, it is reported that there were some 30 officers in plain clothes mixed in the crowd at the close of the meeting, to quell any violence that might be attempted then. The chief of police is reported to have said: “The way it is written in my book everyone should have the privilege of worshiping God according to his belief, and I wanted to see that these people did just that.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Jehovah’s witnesses do not hold any feelings of bitterness against the people of Parkersburg. As a whole they seem to be for freedom. Their officials represent well their interests in that freedom. The school board and superintendent honor contracts, the Y.M.C.A. does not capitulate to threats and pressure, the police force not only speaks but acts for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">civil liberties, the ministers of the community</span><span class="font12"> have a true concept of freedom of worship and stand fw it, and it is evident that as a whole the veterans’ organizations thereabouts do not believe in running roughshod over peaceful assemblies. R. Tracy Evans and a scattering of rabble seem to stand alone in their devotion to methods of threat and pressure and mobocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cowardice and Injustice</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But Evans boasts that the cowardly fight against freedom will continue. We say “cowardly’ because after fomenting the minor riot he sought to disclaim responsibility for it, in the following statement: “The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">demonstration this afternoon</span><span class="font12"> by the Veterans Council terminated with the withdrawal of our colors from the school property. The Veterans Council does not feel responsible for any altercation that may have taken place after the withdrawal of our colors.” (Parkersburg </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">News,</span><span class="font12"> April 26) He would not stand behind the few he could push into the front-line fight. That the fight was to continue is shown by Evan’s statement that the Veterans Council would push for the resignation of superintendent of schools Wharton and Y.M.C.A. general secretary Helfer. Will the people of Parkersburg allow this frustrated fanatic’s venom to be thus turned on the two who stood for freedom?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If so, injustice greater than that committed on April 25 will be wreaked. Greater, for instance, than that perpetrated against the school janitor, who was beaten by hoodlums when he came to lock up for the night, after the meeting. Greater, even, than the riling attack by bullies on the person of Charles William Taylor, 23-year-oid navy hospital-man first class. lie merely went to the auditorium to pick up a passenger, but this holder of two purple heart decorations'for landings at Saipan and Iwo Jima was whisked off to the outskirts of town in one car with two other carloads of “veterans” following. His protestations that he </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">was no Witness hut a </span><span class="font12">navy man failed to penetrate the foggy-s brained “patriots”. Seven men crowded around him after he was taken from the car. The first blow came from behind. After all, there were only seven to face this one “Witness”, as • they thought. Blood spurted over his face, memory dimmed. He was hurled over a fence after the beating, with this parting threat ringing in his ears: “Next time you’ll end up with a 38 in your head!” Evans, of course, also disclaims responsibility for this. He took no part in the explosive violence. He just lit the fuse. Why, he is super patriotic! He says so. And he overflows with religious tolerance. That direct from his lips, also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Lips and tongues can turn out smooth speeches that tickle ears and deceive many minds, but actions out of harmony with such mouthings only show up hypocrisy. Those whose words and actions do not match harmoniously should take stock. Is it through ignorance, a blindness to the inconsistency of word and act? Or do the words slide out in deliberate design to deceive, to sugar-coat a reprehensible act? Are thosb that laud American ideals with their lips but trample them underfoot by their acts Americans? In name only. And those that say “Lord, Lord” with their mouth but </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">fail to do His will, and oppose Bible </span><span class="font12">meetings and act as Christ Jesus never did, are they Christians? In name only. —Matthew 7:20, 21; 15: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">tfORAUp! Fraud I” was the</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">J? recent cry of the National Republican party in Costa Rica. The cry came when its candidate, former President Rafael Angel Calderon Guardia, lost the February 8 election to the candidate of the National Union party, newspaperpublisher Otilio Ulate Blanco. According to the of- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;«</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">ficial count Ulate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;./iSj</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">had won by a mar-gin of 10,000 votes. However, the official party claimed that there had been frauds committed at the polls and that many of the voters supporting the government’s candidate had not been able to cast their vote. Added to the cry of “fraud”, parades were organized by Dr. Calderon’s party members, these augmented by Vanguardia Popular, Costa Rica’s Communist party, headed by Congressman Manuel Mora.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Election Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Much name-calling and mudslinging was done by both sides, and both candidates, accompanied by their adherents, covered most of the republic in speechmaking tours. The strong cry of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Ulatistas</span><span class="font12"> was to take the grafters out of power and to put an end to communism in Costa Rica, branding the gov-ernment’s candidate as a red. On the other hand, Calderon’s party was accusing the opposition of being a capitalist’s party and that it was their aim to oppress the working class and to destroy all legislation that was in favor of labor. The high point of the campaign came on January 25, when the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Calderonistas </span><span class="font12">came into San Jose from all corners of the country, by train, bus and any other means by which they could be brought in, for this final manifestation. The Calderon party leaders called it a huge success and plastered the city with posters</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">stating that Calderon was ‘God’s choice because he was the people’s choice’. The opposition accused them of having used trick photography in making up the foto of the group at the end of their parade in “Plaza Viquez”, where the speeches were made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Election day, Sunday, February 8, came and the Costa Rican voters went to the polls. The election was quiet and both parties stated that it had been the most peaceful one in twenty-five years, and that it had been free of government influence at the polling places. Early reports gave Dr. Calderon the advantage, and between announcements cheering of the official party members at the president’s house came in clear over the radio as the announcer read the telegrams coming in from the electoral tables in various parts of the country, Monday, when more results came in, the margin was in favor of Ulate, and with the final count Ulate had a margin of a little over 10,000 votes, having carried San Jose Alajuela, Cartago and Heredia provinces; while Dr, Calderon carried the other three, Puntarenas, Guanacaste and Limon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Election Results Questioned</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Calderonistas,</span><span class="font12"> however, would not admit defeat and kept up their campaign cry of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Calderon Guardia sera presidente&quot;</span><span class="font12"> (Calderon Guardia will be president). The government radio as well as the communist station urged their supporters ‘into the streets’ to ask for a new election, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Queremos votar” </span><span class="font12">(we want to vote) was all that Could be heard from the demonstrators, both men and women. All the while the electoral board was reviewing the results, so they could give their final decision before Congress met on March 1. When the decision finally came the three-man board could not come to a unanimous agreement, two of them declaring Otilio Ulate Blanco president-elect, while the third said he could not agree with his colleagues, because the time had been too short to give the ballots the proper scrutiny. This gave the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">government the</span><span class="font12"> loophole it needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This one dissenting vote was sufficient to fan even higher the fast-growing flame of antagonism, causing it to encircle the entire country. There were more demonstrations on the part of the Calderon supporters, these being urged on </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">by frenzied radio</span><span class="font12"> announcers. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">It must </span><span class="font12">be said of the Ulate radio propagandists that, quite to the contrary, they insisted that their supporters stay at home, celebrate the victory indoors and not antagonize or dispute with their provocators. However, over the air both sides kept the air waves hot with their insults of each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On March 1, then, Congress convened to settle the issue of whether the election of February 8 had been legal. The Calderon party had the majority in Congress, counting the Communist or Van-guardia Popular deputies that would continue supporting the government candidate. The debate was heated and the gallery was full of government backers. When a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">C alder onista</span><span class="font12"> spoke they cheered, and when one of the opposition deputies rose to speak he was booed, so that he could hardly be heard when he shouted into the microphone. Finally, the Communist leader, Manuel Mora, and one of his colleagues, the Communist deputy from Puntarenas, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">took the </span><span class="font12">floor to quiet the spectators so that they themselves could hear their opponents arguments. Slowly the noise abated and order was restored. When the final vote was taken the election was declared illegal by a vote of 19 to 27. Of the nineteen, four were </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Calderonistas</span><span class="font12"> who had voted not to annul the election, including the president of Congress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This action of the leftist majority in Cpngress gave the green light to the government forces and the Communists, already armed and patrolling the streets of San Jose. Homes and business places of the Ulate party members were searched for arms, and where none were </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">found other articles of value</span><span class="font12"> were taken. One such attempt was made on the home of a famous San Jose physician where Ulate had taken up his headquarters. The house was surrounded by government troops and the occupants of the house were ordered to open up to them. When they refused two soldiers were ordered to go over the wall fence; these were shot down, and then the shooting began in earnest. The result was that the doctor was critically wounded and American and British diplomats, along with the archbishop of Costa Rica, came to the rescue of Mr. Ulate and the wounded doctor. The doctor was carried to the hospital, where he died several days later, and Mr, Ulate, with some of his closest party members, was taken to jail, but released the next day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Comes the Revolution</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The doctor’s death set off the fuse in the opposition ranks, and. uprisings were reported in various parts of the country. The main one, and the one that has turned out to be the revolt, took place in San Isidro de General at the end of the Pan-American Highway to the south of San Jose. The opposition forces took over the airport at San Isidro and from there began to move in toward the capital. When government forces went in to halt them, the opposition forces under Jose Figueres threw up a road block of highway machinery, and the two forces shot it out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">No one knows how many men Figueres lost. Early in the revolt the government lost three of its generals, said to have been riding along in Figueres’ section in a jeep. The estimates for all men dead run into fantastic figures; however, fairly reliable sources give the number of dead around 1,000. There is no way to know the exact , number, as military censorship does not permit any data to be published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The clergy have had a strong hand in the politics here, and precisely when the archbishop with representatives of the candidates as well as with Communist representatives were negotiating to put a third man into the presidency is when the revolt broke out in San Isidro. There were several day and night sessions, but it seems that they could not make any agreement that would satisfy both parties. The clergy’s meddling in politics has not had the approval of many Costa Ricans, and especially since Archbishop Sanabria came out in favor of Ulate after the election, after having been a Calderon supporter. One head of a San Jose family said he was prohibiting his family from ever returning to the church. Some high church officials upheld the archbishop’s stand and others of the clergy have flatly denounced it; thus it is seen that they are ‘a house divided’, and instead of uniting the people they tend to cause even greater divisions among them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When the revolt broke out all constitutional guarantees were suspended and a military censorship was put on all correspondence. Truck loads of “recruits&quot; went up and down the streets with rifles, looting at will. Private homes continued to be searched, and arrests made. Looting became so bad that recently Van-guardia Popular came out in </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">La Tribuna </span><span class="font12">with an announcement denouncing such vandalism and at the same time stating that such treatment w’as an abuse of authority or even lack of authority. They asked punishment for those thus disgracing their uniform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Soldiers and Supplies</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Many of the recruits sent to the front had never had a rifle in their hands before, much less any training in warfare. They were picked up off the streets and piled into trucks or buses to be taken to the front. Those that refused to go were taken to jail. The first ones the government put into service were the wharf hands from the Pacific ports. For night guard duty in the city, postal and other government employees were put into the service. One postal employee remarked that he was doing guard duty from eight to five and taking care of his work at the post office during the day. He also confided that the oppositionists outnumbered the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Calderonistas</span><span class="font12"> but didn’t have the arms, stating at the same time that the Communists were well armed and that they knew how to use them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">How furious the fighting was at the time no ope knew, as the official reports published did not go into detail. The region where the fighting took place is mountainous and wooded. The reports that filtered in and that were heard on the street showed that the Figueres forces fought guerrilla style. Another disadvantage to the government forces was the fact that its </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">mariachis</span><span class="font12"> (men in arms, not regular soldiers) were mostly from the low tropical coastlands; and in the mountainous region, some 10,000 feet above sea level, the extreme cold'was hard on these men from the very hottest regions of Costa Rica. Most of them are without shoes and have only light clothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To supply some of the needed food and clothing for its men, the government requisitioned these provisions from the local businessmen. This was being abused greatly and a government order was published to the effect that no merchandise was to be given over unless the one asking for it had the proper papers ordering such supplies. However, most people don’t argue with them when a truck load, armed with rifles, pulls up and sends in a spokesman to ask for what they want. When asked where the authority is, the rifles are pointed to as being sufficient. Many of the trucks and buses which are used for transportation of government troops were gotten in the same way, either requisitioned or taken. The owner of a bus line operating in the city went to see about two of his buses that had been taken over, and as a result he spent several days in jail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">With the military censorship all opposition radio stations and newspapers were closed down, including Ulate’s </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Diario de Costa Rica</span><span class="font12"> with its afternoon sheet </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">La Hora.</span><span class="font12"> This left only </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">La Tribuna</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">La Prensa Libre.</span><span class="font12"> Before the election </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">La Prensa Libre</span><span class="font12"> leaned toward the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Ulatistas</span><span class="font12"> and was quite critical of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">the other side. Since censorship,</span><span class="font12"> however, it has taken a strictly down-the-middle-of-the-road policy and seldom mentions present conditions, sticking mostly to outside dispatches and local news of minor consequence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Communism Issue</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Costa Rica maintains a</span><span class="font12"> small army with a mobile unit; This equipment was purchased from the United States, and at the time it was brought into the country the Costa Ricans were not in favor of it, stating that it would have been better to have brought in agricultural equipment. This also leaves a bad feeling, especially since the United States is combating Communism. Those with anti-communistic feelings state that while Communism is being combatted on the home front, the Americans were arming them in Costa Rica.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This raises the dispute whether Calderon is Communist. The government newspaper in its issue of April 6, 1948, says that he is not and cites a pontifical statement approving of him, quoting from the same </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">La Tribuna</span><span class="font12"> in their issue of May 8, 1943. This may be well with some, yet others remember that the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Vanguardistas,</span><span class="font12"> parade with the Russian flag and that not too long ago this same Communist party staged a demonstration against “Yankee imperialism”, and that it lent its entire support to the government candidate, Dr. Calderon Guardia, in the past election. At present its members are armed in defense of the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On the other hand the government backers accuse Jose Figueres of being a Falangist and terrorist. It is on his property to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font12"> south of San Jose where the fighting broke out. According to reports he has been training men and preparing for this for about two years. He was put out of the country during the Calderon administration and then permitted to return under President Picado.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But by the latter .part of April the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Costa Rican rebellion had subsided. On </span><span class="font12">April 13 both sides issued cease-fire orders. On April 20 Santos Leon Herrera was installed as provisional president, till May 8, when a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">junta</span><span class="font12"> (board) would take over the government of Costa Rica. On April 24 Jose Figueres and his army arrived in the capital. A dispatch to the New York </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font12"> dated May 7/said that the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">junta</span><span class="font12"> would be led by Jose Figueres, also in command of the army. It listed nine other departments, with 'their appointed secretaries, including “Father” Nunez, chaplain of the army of liberation, as head of the department of labor. All appointees took active part in the revolution. The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">junta</span><span class="font12"> is to rule for 18 months, with a possible 6-month extension. Thus stood matters in troubled little Costa Rica early in May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">What the Costa Ricans need is God’s kingdom; not revolutions. Many have sought it and its blessings, others are learning about it, and many are inquiring about it as they see that all this old </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">world</span><span class="font12"> can offer is misery, suffering, injustice and death, no matter under which kind of established man-rule. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">—Awake!</span><span class="font12"> correspondent in Costa Rica.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">WITHIN the gigantic Russian Soviet W Socialist Republic (one of the sixteen Soviet states) lies one of. the strangest and most mysterious regions in the world. It is called Siberia. A strange country is Siberia, because it is so vast and cold and primitive, and yet so rich, A mysterious place it is, because the fate of some eighty peoples, most of whom have all but vanished within its borders, remains a tale untold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Siberia begins at the boundary line between Europe and Asia, that is, the Ural mountains in Russia, and stretches eastward to swallow up the whole northern half of-the continent of Asia, ending in the Bering sea, just 56 miles short of Alaska. It is twice as big as continental United States. Except for a southern fringe of rolling steppe, Siberia is characterized by two immense geographical zones. One is called the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">tundra,</span><span class="font12"> the other </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">taiga.</span><span class="font12"> To visualize the tundra, picture a country up north of the Arctic Circle, a country of desolate wind-beaten wastes, where the temperature drops to 90° below zero (F.), where the subsoil is frozen permanently, where unending marshes remain, solid ice —except during the very short intense summers, when they burst forth miraculously resplendent with many-colored flowers : that is the Siberian tundra. As your imagination travels south below</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>SIBERIA</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Land of Vanishing Peoples</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">the Arctic Circle, you see the tundra gradually merging into an immeasurable expanse of jungle-like forest, a forest over a thousand miles broad from east to west and interspersed with swamps as great as the seas. This forest, embracing the most colossal tract of virgin timber on earth, is the Siberian taiga. The trees are predominantly a coniferous variety, such as spruce, pine, fir, cedar and larch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Siberia’s rivers flow north. And though they are comparatively short, as great rivers go, they include three of earth’s mightiest: the Ob, the Yenisei and the Lena. They roll their frigid journeys through both taiga and tundra to empty into the Arctic ocean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Siberia is rich; how rich no one knows. Such natural resources as its timber, iron, oil and coal are just at the stage of being sampled by the Communist regime. Its vanishing native people never troubled themselves with wealth of that kind, but pursued their primitive industries of reindeer breeding, seal hunting and fishing. There is gold along the Kolyma river, and there is coal and iron in the region of the Amur, and much oil on Sakhalin island. But such points as these mark only a few of the southern and eastern outposts of Siberia, where a lacework of industrial cities are being built to sap its wealth. As for the wealth of the interior, it remains for the most part in “cold storage”.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19480608_files/g_E_19480608-11.png" alt="" style="width:363pt;height:171pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Conquerors and Exiles</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Siberia, though twice the size of the United States, has but one-fifth the population, a total of some twenty-eight million inhabitants. At least ninety-five percent of this population occupies only a thin ribbon of land along the southern edge of Siberia, whence runs the Trans-Siberian, the world’s longest railroad. This leaves the vast Siberian interior the most desolate wilderness on earth. The majority of inhabitants are Great Russians, Ukrainians and Cossacks, who for ages emigrated across Siberia in the role of conquerors and race exterminators. These “foreigners” or </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">siberiaks </span><span class="font12">dominate the existing order of things. West from Vladivostok and not far within its borders live close to 200,000 Korean refugees who fled from the Japanese war lords who annexed their homeland in 1910. In this same general vicinity are about 30,000 Chinese who have seeped over the frontier. Then just north of the Ariiur river are about 150,000 Jews who have been collectivized into their own Jewish Autonomous Region. With the taking over of southern Sakhalin island and the Kurile islands from Japan, as her share of the war loot in 1945, the Soviet added to her Siberian population about 400,000 Japanese, some of whom may be repatriated or absorbed for keeps in the notorious Siberian labor colonies, along with untold numbers of German and Italian war prisoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But, of a certainty, these Japanese, German, Italian and other nationals do not find themselves the only foreigners in the land. A large segment of Siberia’s population are descendants of political exiles, convicts, religious nonconformists, former serfs, and other unfortunates who fell under the displeasure of the Russian czars as well as the Bolsheviks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Eighty Vanishing Races</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The conquerors plus the exiles (that is, the Great Russians, Ukrainians and Cossacks) added to the foreign prisoner populations and other exiles, are estimated to make up twenty-seven out of the twenty-eight million population of Siberia. This means that although there are some eighty native peoples of Siberia alive today, yet the remnants of all these races tolled together will not exceed one million souls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">That tells a story of race extermination that puts to shame the demise of the American Indians. In fact, some of these ancient Siberians were in all probability the ancestors of the American natives. Students of the human race generally agree that in the remote past Siberian tribesmen migrated across Bering strait, which is only fifty-six miles wide and interspersed -with islands, and gradually spread over Alaska, North, Central and South America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Like the American Indians, the native Siberians were nomads or seminomads. They roamed over the immense, unsettled spaces of Asia, hunting and fishing and grazing their herds of reindeer on the ever-shifting pastures. Into modern times they remain the most backward of all racial groups within the Soviets. The Orochons (“deer breeders”) who dwell among the low mountain regions inland from Japan, were found by a Soviet schoolteacher to be totally ignorant of the use of such everyday items as soap, towels, beds, knives, forks, pens and pencils. Orochon children were unafraid of all sorts of wild animals, but of cows they were desperately frightened. The Oirats, the very first people met in crossing Siberia from the east, still dwell in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">chooms, </span><span class="font12">which are cone-shaped, bark-covered tents similar to tepees. In southeast Siberia, along the coastal region of the Amur river, live the Nivki, who, if they have not changed their customs of late, still hunt with bow and arrow, and dwell</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font12">in mud huts filled with the stench of sun- <sup>J</sup> They also hunt wolves, bears and foxes.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">dried fish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">By reason of being the most backward, the native Siberians fell victims to the invading Russians and other conquering hordes from the west They were exterminated without mercy. They never had the chance to learn the ways of civilization. The proof is mutely attested to in the tiny remnants of the many tribes yet barely existent. Take, for example, the Oduls. These people, inhabiting the vicinity of the Kolyma river, were at one time so numerous that there was a saying that “the smoke of the Oduls’ bonfires hid the twinkling of the stars”. Today not more than 500 Oduls remain in the land of the living. Poverty and famine at times drove the Oduls. to eating larch wood,, and such things account for many of them perishing but there are gold deposits along the Kolyma river, and that accounts for the Oduls’ troubles too. And then there are, or were, the Ainu. These natives of southern Sakhalin island were once so numerous they occupied most of Japan proper. Today only a few thousand Ainu remain, about 1,000 of them living within the Siberian borders. The Aleuts, inhabiting the bleak, frigid Komandorskie islands, had been decimated by 1917 to 300 survivors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Not that all the native peoples of Siberia are extirpated to such extremes, of course. The most westerly Siberian tribe, the Oirats, of the wild and rugged Altai mountains, number about 50,000. While the Oirats were once a nation of nomad herdsmen, hunters and fishers, the Communist regime has regimented them under an autonomous region of their own; and the modern Oirats find themselves harnessed and geared to the Soviet collective system of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Farther north and east as far as Bering strait live the fairly populous and widely scattered Chuchkis. Their name means “rich in reindeer”. The inland Chuchkis are great reindeer breeders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Those along the seacoasts are mainly seal hunters. They navigate boats built of walrus skins. The Chuchkis are organized under their own Soviet National District, which takes in Big Diomede island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To the Siberians the Soviet system boasts of having brought modernized industry, educational and cultural enlightenment, and the spirit of racial equality (which is of small worth after the races are reduced to the point of thin air). It boasts of granting theoretical religious freedom, whether that be so-called “Christian”, Mohammedan, or the animistic cult of bear worship,.as practiced by the primitive Ainu. But to the one thing that matters, the glorioiis kingdom of Jehovah God under Christ Jesus, the Soviet regime seems determined not to throw open the benighted land of vanishing peoples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">And yet there is a power operating in strange, mysterious Siberia far stronger, more invincible than the iron will of the Soviet Kremlin; a power that is making it possible for the Siberians, whether natives, slaves, exiles or conquerors, to hear the message of that established and reigning Kingdom. The proelaimers are themselves prisoners and exiles, consigned to Siberian labor camps for being </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">real witnesses</span><span class="font12"> of the Most High God. These true Christians heard and accepted the Kingdom message while prisoners with Jehovah’s witnesses in German Nazi concentration camps. Once again prisoners, this time in Siberia, they look with hope unflinching to freedom in the new world of righteousness, and their hope they are reflecting into the hearts of all that hear. Surely Jehovah, the Lord Most High, has determined, by ways more strange than man’s, that the blessings of life and freedom in His glorious New World shall be shared by all nationalities, kindreds, peoples and tongues, including the vanishing peoples of Siberia.—Contributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">A</span><span class="font12"> BRITISH humor magazine recently published a cartoon picturing a lovesick artist sitting in his studio with a visitor. The sadfaced artist is surrounded by many identical portraits of his ladylove, and he is putting the finishing touches on still another, as he explains to his friend: “I think of her night and day. I just can’t do anything except paint her over and over again,” It appears that the artist is a modernist, and the humor of the situation is seen in his paintings of a weird, geometrical, half-abstract monstrosity that vaguely, very vaguely, resembles a girl’s face.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The artist who prides himself in belonging to one or another of an impressive array of modernist schools or trends will probably fail to see any humor in the- dilemma of the lovesick artist. .To him the subject of a painting is not important. He argues that the subject matter of art is within you. He advocates letting the imagination run riot; &quot;Paint your dreams and confess your subconscious mind,&quot; says he. To him it matters not that he is breaking established rules of perspective, proportions or color-harmony. The pent-up figments of. his imagination are the important things that must be expressed in oils or some other visible medium for an appreciative world to see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It appears, however, that the appreciation is confined to a relatively small clique of fellow artists, dealers in art, critics, and collectors who claim to understand the artist’s viewpoint. Although a modern painting may be a prize winner, and may be acclaimed by an art jury as a superb example of. modern art, the average layman fails to become enthusiastic. Upon viewing the prize winner the reactions of some run in this vein: “A five-year-old child could do better” ; “stupid”; “It’s hung upside-down”;</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19480608_files/g_E_19480608-12.png" alt="" style="width:372pt;height:119pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">&quot;a 'waste of paint and canvas”; “what does it mean?” The prize-tvinning painting, “Cyqlops,” by William Baziotes, like most modern paintings, had to be explained to spectators at the Chicago Art Institute, where it won first prize.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The mysterious names which have sprung up to label the various styles of modern art do nothing to help clarify the artist’s point of view or to make the paintings any more worthy of appreciation. If anything, when the layman-bears of surrealism, dadaism, cubism, monobjectivity, neoplasticisin, futurism, or purism he will wish he were home w’ith his photo album, looking at some pictures he can understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One might reasonably wonder what caused this degeneration and confusion in art. The change has been particularly apparent from and after World War I. The super-sensitive artist welcomed this new freedom from old standards and restrictions. Art had been floundering, and the market for creative work of all kinds -was narrowing into commercial channels and becoming highly specialized. With the perfecting of high-speed multi-colored printing, thousands upon thousands of pictures of the kind suitable for decorating homes could be rapidly produced and sold cheaply. Commercial photographers took over the business of making portraits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In short, the artist had no master to serve. Unwanted, he turned to himself, and the result during this “brain age” has been a flood of “cerebral” paintings, called by the dayman “modernistic art”. The public does not like it. When one speaks of “modernistic art” it is almost always done in a derisive way. When the public has opportunity to vote for the painting that is best liked in an exhibi-tion,-the cerebral brainstorms are passed by and the winner is found to be a picture that is understandable; one that arouses a feeling of appreciation for the content and the treatment of the subject. The artist adhering to the extreme modern trend, however, is not interested in pleasing the public. He is too intent on exploiting that grand new freedom he has found. It is a freedom that has given him a master to serve and worship: his own wonderful brain!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Is It Art?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Critics stoutly defend contemporary painting with all of its extreme trends on the basis that it truly reflects the spirit of our present complex civilization. With distracting wordiness many art critics who have a regular column to fill in a newspaper or magazine sing the praises of modern painters and their works. This is understandable. There would be no point in cutting off their bread and butter by condemning modern art. Many thousands of words can be written about the esthetic values and other vagaries of the latest modern trend. With impressive language they invest the paintings with a quality of which the artists themselves may have been unaware. The following report by Sam Hunter on an exhibit of the modernist, Mr. Stamos, is typical:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Although non-representational, Stamos’ work is part of a neo-romantie revival that includes Baziotes and Gottlieb amopg others reacting against the asceticism of cubism and tion of material, presumably archaic images from man’s collective memory, rather man a convention of plastic method. . . . The images themselves are certainly compelling and have the haunting character of remainders, a glowing sea-hoard of deciduous memory objects that are neither flesh, fish, nor fowl, ,but elu-sively metamorphose across the boundaries of all living categories.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font11">its severe linear method. Stamos generalizes his personal poetic emotion through a eonven-</span></p><img src="g_E_19480608_files/g_E_19480608-13.png" alt="" style="width:543pt;height:128pt;">

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">By using the typewriter as their palette knife and the dictionary as their pigments, the critics add a thick layer of distinction and mystery to the already overburdened canvases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A real favorite of the critics is the branch of modern art known as surrealism. This is a style that is directed by dreams and “thought’s dictation in the absence of all control exercised by the reason and outside of all esthetic or moral preoccupations”, according ,to the French leader of this style, Andre Breton, In this country, the name of Salva-dore Dali is synonymous with surrealism. His carefully executed paintings of recognizable though unrelated and distorted objects are well known to many. Dali had at one time been a sincere realist, that is, he painted a subject as it really was. Although he was a good craftsman he was not a success; his paintings didn’t sell. Then he applied the surrealism formula by tossing former standards and principles into the trash can. Today he is a success in the eyes of his patronizing public. His view of that public, however, is not good, for in his autobiography he states: “After having be^n unable to sell mv sincere works of art, I decided to capitalize on the stupidity of the public and make them pay for my living/'</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Many aspiring artists ana otners totally ignorant of the fundamentals of art who find their efforts being ignored have discovered, like Dali, that &quot;the public likes to be humbugged”. They begin to imitate the most popular trends, and the more original ones invent new styles of their own. The artist who can make it appear that the distorted shapes and color blobs on his canvas are the essence of thoughts and dreams of a remarkable intellect stands a good chance of catching the attention of the critics, and the patrons of modern art. If some wild nightmare of a painting provokes more than usual controversy or wins a prize, the happy artist can name his own price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Demon Influence</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The most famous name in modern art today is Pablo Picasso. He is a 65-year-old Spanish-born artist now living in Paris, where he enjoys the distinction of being its number one citizen. In listing the reasons for his high reputation, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Life </span><span class="font12">magazine says: &quot;He is the most talked-about man in Paris ... The most prolific and unpredictable artist of his time has once more changed his style.” A picture accompanying the article shows Picasso, clad only in shorts and sandals, standing in his studio against a background of his latest paintings. These are large upright canvases, measuring about four feet wide by eight feet high, containing simple outline drawings against a plain white background. The quality of the drawing is almost on a par with the &quot;art” of young pranksters who scribble on the margins of subway posters and add a mustache or beard here and there. Aside from the style or technique this world-renowned artist is now using, the thing of special significance is the subject of these paintings. It appears that Mr. Picasso is soliciting the blessings of the Devil, for each of the pictures shown is that of a horned monster with animal hoofs. One bearded centaur holding a speared pitchfork might easily pass for a portrait of Satan the Devil himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">we are not unaware of the popularity of spiritism today, with its shrouded mediums, wide-eyed people holding hands around a table, chain rattlings and spirit manifestations. When spiritism and art join hands some ghastly results may well be expected. This is seen in the paintings of the occult artist, Mrs. Marion Spore Bush, now deceased. She is said to have baffled and delighted critics for more than twenty yeafs with her mysteriously produced paintings. She had held many exhibitions in reputable galleries in New York city and London. In writing the reviews, the critics were true to their usual form and, for lack of more exact words, used such expressions as “primitive mystic” and “psychic sensitive”. Mrs. Bush referred to the forces that guided her brush at the easel as “They&quot;’, and believed “They&quot;’ were the spirits of long-dead artists. She explains her method of working this way: “After I get the canvas on the easel, and paint in readiness, ‘They’ move my hand up and down and onward across and sideways in all directions, as if measuring out the perspective. Sometimes ‘They* do this until my arm aches. Then all at once, ‘They’ make a rudimentary sketch, or perhaps ‘They’ begin to paint without any sketch or outline at all.” As one might expect, Mrs. Bush’s paintings were of that wild, grotesque style that characterizes modern art. Surely such demon-inspired, demon-directed art does absolutely nothing toward relieving the distress of this old world; it contributes nothing toward the help and benefit of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sub>#</sub> There is ample evidence that a strong tie exists between Satan, the god of this world, and the modern brain-worshiping artist. Satan’s wicked ambition to “be like the Most High” has remained unchanged through the centuries, and during that time he has instilled his brand of selfish egotism into the minds of any who would not resist him. That included many glory-seeking artists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Their willingness to serve the Devil is proved by their fashioning of “sacred” images, in direct violation of God’s commandment forbidding such. Museums ton-day are cluttered with art objects from practically every land and civilization. These include a large variety of items from fettishes, masks, and ceremonial jewelry of primitive peoples to Egyptian mummy cases ornately decorated with symbols of their demon gods. All of these religious appendages, so highly venerated by their makers and users, bear the God-dishonoring stamp of their inspirer, Satan the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In this connection, the ceremonial masks used by the witch doctors of primitive lands is of particular interest- The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">American Weekly</span><span class="font12"> recently published an article by T. H. Robsjohn-Gibbings, a noted art expert and one of the few who has the courage to show up modern art for what it is worth. His thought is that modernist painters are employing the tricks of “black magic” borrowed from witch doctors. He writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The witch doctors Used very simple methods to create a belief in their magic powers. Their first problem was to rivet the attention of their audience, and they knew that nothing holds attention so much as a familiar object in wild distortion. Accordingly, they took something as ordinary as a man’s face,'and, by carefully guarded formulas, turned it into a monstrosity of a mask. The effect was spectacular. The audience was fascinated and awed. They believed implicitly in the supernatural powers of the witch doctors. The unemployed artists lost no time in turning these magic tricks to their advantage. . . . The artists took an everyday scene—a fishing boat, a street, or a man’s face—and, by distorting them almost beyond recognition and depicting them in incongruous and shocking colors, they stopped the gallery-goers dead in their tracks. While the spectator stood confused and hypnotized at seeing his familiar world so dislocated, he was told that what he saw was the result of a new supernatural vision of “genius”, a vision unattainable by lesser </span><span class="font12">mortals. It was the identical process used by the witch doctors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Conclusion of the Matter</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Hence the reasons why the average sincere person today dislikes modern art is much less of a mystery than the art. Not only are such paintings lacking in any uplifting values on their face, but the insincerity, incompetence and shameless cheating on the part of the artists are plainly evident. Mr. Average Man will not get excited over the products of these supposedly “intellectual” aerobatics, but will leave this up to the snobbish patrons who collect and exhibit the “masterpieces” of these “masterbrains”. The thoughtful person will not be convinced by the verbose descriptions and arguments of the critics in their defense of modern art. Further, he sees no point in wrangling as to whether or not it is art, for as that word is generally used in a broad sense to mean all forms of creative or cultivated expression, modern painting could easily come within that scope. The thing that an honest person is convinced of - is, that if it is art, it bears evidence of being in a perverted and degraded form. This is no more than what may be expected, for an observing person can easily see that this is indeed a perverted and degraded old world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On &quot;the other hand, it would be wrong to assume a dogmatic attitude and say all contemporary art is worthless. Many paintings produced today are delightfully beautiful and decorative. Hence they serve a commendable purpose. The painters of these works do not think, highly of themselves, but display a great love for art and sincerity toward their fellow man. Such will be the attitude of the artist in the new earth. Then all the creative arts may reach a perfection of expression that will bring joy to the .hearts of men as well as reflect the infinite wisdom of the great Creator.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">The Christian’s Commission at the World’s End</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">COMMISSION is a formal authority granting to the one named in it</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">certain rights, privileges and preroga-ives and commanding certain things to be done as' duties. All anointed Christians have such a commission from God it this end of the world. That is where we are, according to all the signs on the iarth fulfilling Bible prophecy. They are mointed with God’s spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In ancient time the shepherd David res anointed with oil by Jehovah’s jrophet Samuel to be visible king over he topical Theocracy of the nation of ’srael. That was David's commission, or he thing he was commanded to perform. Jhrist Jesus, when He was begotten of lod’s spirit at 'the Jordan river, was mointed, not with oil, but with the spirit jf His Father, to be Kung of the real Theocratic Government. But when He res on earth He did not actively enter n upon His rule and destroy His ene-nies and restore Paradise on earth. Nor lid He do this even when He ascended to leaven into His heavenly Father’s pres-mce. What, then, was the purpose of Jesus’ being anointed while on earth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">His anointing was to commission Him to act as God’s Spokesman and to preach the gospel of the coming Righteous Government. The prophecy of Isaiah 61:1,2, which was then fulfilled primarily in Him, said for Him: “The spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me; because Jehovah hath anointed me to' preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me. to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the year of Jehovah’s favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn.’’ </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Am. Sian. Ver.)</span><span class="font12"> The point of all this was that the anointed Jesus must be a .preacher of the good news, He must be a faithful and true witness of Jehovah God. Christ’s anointed followers, including the remnant of them at this end of the world, are made joint-heirs of Kingdom glory with Jesus. But, while they are in the flesh, their anointing with God’s spirit lays upon them the obligation now to be witnesses of Jehovah and to preach and bear witness concerning His Theocratic Government,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Jesus, when on earth, was faithful in that unto which He was anointed. Therefore the last book of the Bible speaks of Him as “Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn of the’ dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. . . . the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God”. (Revelation 1: 5; 3:14, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font12"> All the faithful apostles, including Paul of Tarsus, were Chris Hike witnesses of Jehovah. Paul was very specific as to his own performance of his anointing to preach. He said: “I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house, testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks.’-’—Acts 20: 20, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">AU members of the anointed Christians, including the remnant of them at this end of the world, are obliged, by force of their anointing, to be witnesses of Jehovah concerning the Righteous Government in which they shall share with Jesus their anointed Head. “Yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!” (1 Corinthians 9:16) Such obligation to preach applies to the remnant in a special sense, now that the Righteous Government is at hand. For that reason the remnant of the anointed ones have joyfully taken up the name “Jehovah’s witnesses” and have acted under that name according to the prophecy of Isaiah 43:10,12; 44: 8. Hence, as prospective members of the “bride” of Christ, they must now say, “Come,” to all men of good-will on earth today; that these may locate the river of the water of life and may come to it and take of its lifegiving waters freely, without money charge, and thus may find the way to eternal life in the righteous new world. —Revelation 22:17,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In other Watch T6wer publications the reader must find in Bible and in modern history the proofs of the fact that A.D. 1918 the great Bridegroom of the Christian church, namely Jesus Christ, came as Judge to the spiritual temple of God and was fully laid as the temple’s Chief Corner Stone. (See Malachi 3:1-4.) The members of the church or “body of Christ” are likened to “living stones”; and those members of Christ’s body who had died prior to 1918 but who, as living stones, had proved faithful till death were raised from the dead to immortal life in the heavens with their Bridegroom; they were incorporated into the living temple in which God dwells by His spirit. By such union of the resurrected members of the bride of the Lamb, the Bridegroom, the marriage in heaven began taking place. (Revelation 19: 7-9; 21: 2, 9,10) The time was therefore now due for the Spirit and the bride to say, “Come,” for at that time the river of water of life was beginning to flow forth from the temple. It was flowing then from the throne of God and of His Christ: namely,, flowing from the established Theocratic Government. Revelation 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As a result of the Kingdom truths that the Lord God now began to reveal to the remnant through Christ Jesus at the temple, the life-giving, activating spirit began to be poured out upon them and to move them' into God’s .fearless service. This was a final fulfillment of the prophecy of Joel 2: 28-32, which the apostle Peter quoted nineteen centuries ago on the day of Pentecost. From Peter’s quotation of Joel’s prophecy it is manifest that the prophecy did not have its complete fulfillment back there, because the “wonders” and “signs” which the prophecy said God would perform were not then produced.’When, therefore, must the final and complete fulfillment of Joel’s prophecy occur? At this end of the world, after Christ comes to the temple for judgment, after 1918.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Showing what the anointed remnant are commissioned to do down here at this time Joel (2:28-32) said: “And it shall come to pass afterward [or, as Peter quoted it, in the last days], that </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">I </span><span class="font12">will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions : and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit. And I will shew wonders .. . And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord [Jehovah] shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the Lord hath said, and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call.”—See Peter’s quotation thereof at Acts 2:16-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Therefore, by this prophecy the anointed Christians, together with all consecrated persons of good-will who associate with them, are commissioned to show the visions and dreams which are made clear in God’s written word and to prophesy or proclaim publicly the meaning of the Holy Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Brazil Outlaws the Communists</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19480608_files/g_E_19480608-16.png" alt="" style="width:55pt;height:53pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">FROM green rock-jutted hill-tops of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">the interior to</span><span class="font12"> white beaches of Rio, Brazil echoed with' speeches and campaign songs. Like Jack Frost on an icy morn, every kid and his brother were out decorating windows, walls and signboards with the name of his man of the hour. Some plastered well-made posters, others hung banners from house to lamppost, and still others with crude letters splashed doors, walls and gates. After a bloodless revolution ousting dictator Getfilio Vargas, Brazil was open, open to free elections for the first time in almost sixteen years. In the suburbs old government supporters held </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">festinhas</span><span class="font12"> (little parties) in the warm evenings. The Communists put on organized dances, running off dancing contests from their </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">samba</span><span class="font12"> clubs. Alert observers saw a new force arising on the horizon, and they wondered what chances for expansion it would find in the unrestful condition. The Communists, from the beginning, out-advertised all their competitors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Although on December 2, 1946, General Gasper Dutra, with superior church backing, rolled over his competitors to win the presidential election, everybody knew that a new force had been born into Brazilian politics. They would remember for some time to come that the Communist, Yeddo Fiuza, had made a good show of rising strength, and the Communist party had been brought into the political arena.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Since that day they grew to such a threat that the fearful Dutra government put the lid on them. They were outlawed, and barred from their head-quarterS. Then President Dutra’s fumbling government lost the offensive temporarily and found itself unable, legally, to finish off the Communists by turning out the legislators elected on the Communist </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">ticket The government</span><span class="font12"> could </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">not </span><span class="font12">stop the babbling </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Tribuna Popular, </span><span class="font12">mouthpiece of the party. And worse yet, many a thoughtful Brazilian, having no love for Communism, but a lively memory of the old dictatorship, pushed to the aid of the Communist machine in distress and pronounced its right to exist</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Congress became the center of the struggle. Dutra’s governmental fury fell upon the still active Communist congressmen. Only Congress could dissolve them, and Dutra’s P.S.D. (Social Democrat party) could not muster the two-thirds majority to do it. So the battle would be a long-drawn-out campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Then, on a dull day in August,. 1947, after a three-month mystery o*f the whereabouts of Senator Luis Carlos Prestes, secretary-general of Brazil’s outlawed Communist party, broke the news that he was back and in the Senate. It was a red-hot scoop for the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Diario da Noite.</span><span class="font12"> His reappearance was real news and was given front-page story. In the Senate Prestes talked long enough to fill an average-sized newspaper with his speech. He denied rumors that accused him of conspiring against the government with the former dictator Getulio Vargas, but he failed to explain why he had been absent and did not mention the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">rumors that he had been in Russia. Then, </span><span class="font12">in October, 1947, a shadow drew over diplomatic relations between Russia and Brazil, and Brazil broke off relations completely. For the Communists it was a heavy blow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To tighten the governmental grip on the Communists, in October of 1947 Congress established “military control bases” in a good number of the country’s large cities. This made it necessary that the mayors act under the orders of the military commanders. What’s this ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Doesn’t it slap the principles of the new democracy in the face? Does it mean another dictator like Getulio Vargas has come? Apparently it was not quite as bad as all that, but who can say that the Communists don’t think so? Most observers thought it a remedy for the Communist threat. The Communists had stirred up a great threat to the Brazilian government in power, so everyone thought it only a necessary step to meet the threat and keep Dutra in and the new constitution functioning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The following November found exgeneral Dutra taking some of the punches and right where it does the most harm. In an election of high importance last November, 1947, President Dutra’s own P.S.D. (Social Democrat party) splintered beneath his feet. Conniving, fascist-minded Getiilio Vargas, dictator for at least fifteen years, and Luis Carlos Prestes, the Communist he kept jailed for nine of those years, had joined to get control of rich Sao Paulo state. This left Dutra but one course to take and that he did: called on the opposition U.D.N. (National Democratic Union) party for help. Thus he stayed with the fight even though he did lose the round. In the meantime the city of Rio managed to depose eighteen city councilmen and the state of Rio de Janeiro ousted fortyseven members of the state legislature, all acknowledged Communists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Then came the official announcement of the break with Russia. With the Government’s official announcement came, just three and a half hours later, a battering gang of roughnecks, slugging their way into the offices of Rio’s Communist' </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Tribuna Popular.</span><span class="font12"> In their wake they left papers strewn on the street as they tore their way into the printing establishment. They wielded their sledge hammers on the presses and tore down tables and desks, smashing typewriters and machinery, leaving the place a total wreck. Though the destruction took place only 300 yards from the central police station in Rio, the mobsters had the place all alone tor at least two hours before the military police finally arrived. All they did on arrival was to stand around and Watch. For the majority of Brazilians the break with Russia was considered just, but the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Tribuna</span><span class="font12"> smash-up made them think a while to consider the sense of justice and fair play. The following day the whole of the press in Rio went on record as condemning the police and mobsters, and so did Congress. Senator Ivo de Aquino voiced: “We gave our support ... to the government’s attitude toward Russia, but that does not mean we condone acts of violence against any organization, particularly against the press, which by our laws is guaranteed full liberty.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But the end was in sight for the Communists. The showdown had come. All relations with Russia severedj the Communist party was completely outlawed by Congress and Senator de Aquino had sponsored a bill of the government to throw out all Communist jobholders from elective office. The same afternoon that the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Tribuna</span><span class="font12"> was attacked, rowdies tore down the Soviet Embassy’s shield. This is what Moscow translated into an incident of “stoning” of the embassy and caused Ambassador Mario de Pimentel Brandao and his staff of nine to become arrested in their hotel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Six months after the Communist party was banned, and exactly two months after the break in diplomatic relations with Russia, the House of Deputies still argued about what to do with the last Communist senator (Prestes) and sixteen deputies, still holding out in office. One bill to cancel the' Communists’ mandates recently passed the Senate. In the House the Communists tried to stall it by proposing 320 amendments. Shortly after, on the floor, they tried another parliamentary technique, the filibuster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">By January of 1948 the Communist sail was still up, if only partially. The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Tribuna Popular</span><span class="font12"> being e</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">limina</span><span class="font12">ted by rowdies and outlawed by the government, a Communist had to be on the alert to know where and how to buy his newspaper, which had already changed its name four times, and was being published by pres’ses belonging to a private corporation. The government had not yet proved connection between the corporation and the Communist party.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">About a month later came the final issue, Bill 900-A, a measure that would cancel the mandates (jobs) of all Communists in public office. Insults, screams, shrieks and leaping on benches followed. Then a Communist cry of “sell-out” brought the government deputies out in a frenzy. After the vote the count stood 181 to 74 for the bill’s passage. The Communist comrades in last dying shout cried, “Viva General Luis Carlos </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Prestes!&quot; and</span><span class="font12"> “Viva Russia!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">All that remained was for Dutra to sign the bill, which, of course, he obligingly did, and the press gave its shout for joy. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">A Nolte,</span><span class="font12"> bubbling over, said: “The beauty of it is . . that within the law we wereable to put the Communists outside, the law.” Now it seems up to the Red leaders to take things underground again as they were obliged to do in the days of dictator Getulio Vargas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Perhaps the rapid suppression and successful handling of Communism in Brazil can be attributed more to organized religion than any other one source. The clergy play a strong role in politics, but they have not a strong hold on the people. The Brazilian people, on the whole, are hospitable and teachable, and they are turning from one form of religion or politics to another in search of the reason for the present terrible conditions and a means of relief. Eventually all the meek ones of good will toward God will come under the rule in which there will be no political disputes or disunity, the rule </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">which the apostle Peter </span><span class="font12">advocated, when he said, at 2 Peter 3:13 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(An Amer.

<p><span class="font9">&lt;$&gt; As Syrian regulars were reported invading northeastern Palestine early In May the British troopship &quot;Empire Test” arrived at Haifa, carrying one thousand British troops, &quot;in the interest of general security/<sup>1</sup> The Jews considered it a move to keep up British prestige and ease Arab anger over British evacuation of Haifa previously, and its consequent occupation by Jews. Meanwhile a British-imposed truce had been in effect in Jaffa, which had, however, been almost entirely deserted by the Arabs, leaving but 2,000 out of 70,000 there. Fighting between the Arabs and Jews continued in various pajrts of Palestine, Including in and about Jerusalem. King Abdullah of Trans-Jordan on May 6 announced that his armies would certainly enter Palestine as soon as the British withdrew on May 15. He rejected proposals for a ten-day truce after that date. The Arabs (May 7) agreed to a cease-fire in all Jerusalem, where fighting had continued In spite of British efforts to establish a truce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The U. N. (May 14) designated Harold Evans, Philadelphia Quaker, as municipal commissioner for Jerusalem, after „a special agreement on his appointment was reached by Arabs and Jews. The same day the U.

When the new state, called Israel, was actually proclaimed the next day, President Truman promptly recognized the provisional Jewish government As Jews in Palestine rejoiced troops from surrounding Arab countries, Including Egypt, launched their threatened invasion, while all-Jewish Tel Aviv was bombed by Egyptian army planes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">&lt;$&gt; On May 11 it was announced by the Moscow radio that the Soviet had accepted a U. S. proposal that the two countries should open discussions on differences between them. The note was handed to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov by the U. S. Ambassador to Moscow, Gen. Walter Bedell Smith, the previous Tuesday. The U, S. held that the Kremlin’s release of the note was a breach of diplomatic custom, which calls for publication of such correspondence by both powers simultaneously. The state department said further that the note had not been properly represented by Moscow, and that the Soviet government had accepted something that had not been of</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">fered, creating an Impression by </span><span class="font9">Its misinterpretation of the note which was contrary to its purpose.

Winston Churchill struck the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">keynote of </span><span class="font9">the gathering, saying </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">that it </span><span class="font9">sought means to make the “voice of Europe&quot; continually heard </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font9">all free countries.

After four days of Intensive debate the congress voted in favor of asking the governments of Europe to nonlinate delegates to a &quot;European Deliberative Assembly&quot;, to consult officially on the economic and political union of Europe.
