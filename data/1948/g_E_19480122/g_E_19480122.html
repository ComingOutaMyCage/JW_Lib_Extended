<p><span class="font10">NESTLING at the feet of the mighty Himalayan range, like a child snuggling at its mother’s knees, sleeps the peaceful town of Dehra Dun at midnight. A monsoon breeze, cooled by Nanda Devi’s snows, sweeps softly onto the town, through the scattered bungalows of the more prosperous, and penetrating every corner of the congested bazaar, bring-ing relief from the warmth of the day to sleeping forms in rooms, on verandas, or on the public streets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A cry I. A shout! A roar! A roar that gathers intensity, awesome and terrible! A sleeper stirs in his sleep, hears and struggles for consciousness, apprehensive. The volume increases as he gathers his senses and identifies the all-too-frequent cause in liberated India: communal rioting. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Allah ho akhbar!”</span><span class="font10"> (God is great!) From far away sounds the rallying cry of the Moslems. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Allah ho akhbar!&quot; &quot;Allah ho akhbar!&quot;</span><span class="font10"> Nearer it comes as throat after throat takes it up; the cry of desperate courage mingled with blood-chilling fear. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Allah ho akhbar!&quot;—</span><span class="font10">for this night Sikhs and Hindus must slake their thirst in Moslem blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Our awakened sleeper, very much awake, hurries to awaken others. The town is now awake. For this night must see peaceful neighbors transformed into enemies, incendiaries, plunderers, murderers -or murdered. Death now stalks from behind every familiar pillar and post, and the one whom you befriended yesterday today thrusts a knife in your chest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Freedom has come to Dehra Dun!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Why should India be suffering in such a way? Are communal hatred and fratricide- to be among the fruits of her hard-fought-for independence? Serious rioting, although covering a large area, has been limited to one or two provinces. It is now nearing the end of October (at time of writing), and no nation-wide rioting has taken place, although where rioting has occurred it has been terrible. But care and alertness are needed, for tension and suspicion prevail. Bitterness and hatred must give way to allow whatever tolerance and unselfishness the people possess to come to the fore. Otherwise, independence is lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The cause of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">present</span><span class="font10"> trouble can well be located as coming from the Punjab, the land of the. five rivers, onv of the . old provinces of India that was. This province has been known as the sword-arm of India, whence much of her fighting force has been reared. When India was recently divided into two Dominions of the British Commonwealth of Nations last August, the Punjab’s fate as an entity was sealed. She must be split into two: the eastern part to be under the Indian Union, and the western part under Pakistan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But here came the rub. It was in this division that one of the small but very important communities was affected very much. This was the Sikh community</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">which historically has predominated as a martial race. Friction was certain to follow, for they found themselves territorially divided, and their property in different Dominions: part in Pakistan under Moslem dominion, and part in the Indian Union, which. Was practically under Hindu control. Religiously the Sikhs are an offshoot of the Hindus, and politically they are far more disposed to the Union, for had they not already thrown in their lot with the Indian National Congress as opposed to the Moslem League?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With the division of India, and consequently of the Punjab, two of this province's very big towns, Lahore and Amritsar, got separated: Lahore going to Pakistan and Amritsar to the Indian Union. Both were largely inhabited by Sikhs; therefore any existing trouble would now be accentuated and these towns suffer badly. True to expectation, this is what has happened. Both have suffered in looting, arson, kidnaping and killing; and large areas now assume a wartime, blitzed appearance. The Sikhs and Hindus were the victims in Lahore and near-by Pakistan districts^ while the Moslems suffered in Amritsar and other Indian localities. This time, unlike other previous occasions, there were no British troops to keep order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What were the natural reactions? A flight from dangers to come, of the Hindus and Sikhs to India and the Moslems to Pakistan. But wait! As the refugees fled so the terrible accounts of those demonized killings were passed on. Reprisals followed in the wake of the refugees. Pocket contmunities, Moslems in India and Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan, now insecure in their minority positions, heard of these things and feared the threatening hand of vengeance. Those who could do so took to flight, many being killed as they fled; others remained to await their fate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Moslem League for years past has contended that in India there are two separate and distinct nations. But Congress favors the other viewpoint, namely, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">that at heart all are oi one</span><span class="font10"> nationality, Indian, and the only difference that exists being more or less religious. The consequence today is that India urges the Moslems to remain and not migrate to Pakistan, to stay and become loyal citizens of the Indian Union. Protection has been assured to those remaining, but actually in the face of all </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">that has happened, this assurance gives </span><span class="font10">little or no confidence to those concerned. Practical fears of reprisals have urged those in the small pockets to flee fur safety. And so there has been an unprecedented two-way traffic of caravans of thousands upon thousands of refugees between the two dominions. One correspondent described one such as being </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">72 miles in length. The recent report </span><span class="font10">a convoy of refugees to the number of 400,000 surely constitutes a record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In a press account on October 21, the minister for relief and rehabilitation is reported as showing that in Punjab and the North-West Frontier Province some 4,700,000 have been evacuated and that there remained yet about 4,200,000 who were awaiting evacuation. He went on to refer to these as* “souls uprooted from their ancestral homes and carrying with them nightmare memories of their sufferings”. Here, then, we contact the irritating cause of these terrible crimes. In what way? Reprisals!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Reprisals I This tells its own story. As soon as these convoys reached their respective countries, deprived of perhaps all their possessions, the individuals gave expression to their “nightmare memory”. Accounts of the sufferings spread. Many, still smarting under such sufferings, seek for vengeance; or, having lost their lands and homes, look around for members of the community which attacked them in order that they might “right their wrong” and grab their land. Others with a misguided sense of righteousness, although not refugees, join them. Still more, seeing the chance</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">of loot and ill-gotten gain, are keen to assist as jackals accompany the tiger to the kill. Without doubt both sides have been guilty of these vile and wicked atrocities, instigated, perhaps, by a comparative few who have inflamed their millions of compatriots into this terrible madness of retaliation. Are all these reprisals indulged in “just by chance” or is there an organization behind the whole activity? The general pattern and shape of the rioting as a whole suggest that in most cases they are organized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Answering the question as to which side is the more guilty, it appears that blame must be equally borne. It is from this point of view that this article is written, and which should be remembered as it is read. If one particular community is mentioned more than another, it is merely because the information gained happens to be from sources on the Indian side of the border.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Loot, Arson, Kidnaping and Murder</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Returning now to Dehra Dun, then, it can easily be seen that with the influx of refugees from Pakistan trouble would follow; and it did. It was swift and deadly. Within four days, some 11,900 bodies filled the hospital morgues, practically all being Moslem. Many others must have died. One eyewitness contacted by the writer tells of a Moslem family that he had aided the husband of which had been killed, and the wife had had her hands cut off and the children’s limbs twisted and broken at the joints. Powerless to help her suffering children, she sat propped up watching them writhing in pain before death overtook her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Looting was thorough. Orders had been given that looters should be shot. “Shoot to kill!” But police and troops stood by while looters streamed into houses and shops and carried off all kinds of articles. The jackals followed in the wake of Tiger Vengeance as she prowled through the town. All day long this human stream flowed. In other parts worse took place. Occasionally blank rounds were fired by the military, but the looters just halted, made sure that the rounds </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">were</span><span class="font10"> blank, grinned at each other and at the spectators, and then continued with their work. It was easy going for them. The morning came, but not respite for the Moslems and their property. No! The stream still flowed. Suddenly five or six shots rang out. The stream stopped, halted indecisively, and those watching waited for the now familiar “Back to the looting movement”, when hallo! The stream built up into a craven flood of cowards running pell-mell for home. What had happened? Live shots had been used by a military contingent led by a British officer. One or two were killed, and this put an end to the looting on that occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At nighttime improvised guards were formed for the protection of householders. Night after night people were kept awake as those guardians called out incessantly with the definite object of keeping people from sleeping lest they be taken unawares by gangs of looters. The calls of one to another every few seconds, the occasional </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Sub darwaza bund karo<sup>11 </sup></span><span class="font10">(“Close all doors”) and an occasional </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Allah ho akhbar”</span><span class="font10"> resounded throughout the night and early morning, enhancing that eerie acuteness of danger abroad in the dark. Those guards must have slept during the day; for there was little work done, and a continual curfew of nearly three days was in operation in the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With curfew lifted, Moslems who had lain isolated from their community and who still lived would venture to reach some Moslem locality for greater safety. The writer saw one such poignant figure furtively cross the town’s maidan and later heard from friends that round about that time two Sikhs had dismounted from cycles behind a Moslem, probably this selfsame inoffensive man, and split his belly with knives in full view of the public and then nonchalantly and unchallenged proceeded on their</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">way. Had these Sikhs learned of or seen similar things done to their own community in Pakistan, One wonders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Thus it went on, Refugees, coming in their thousands, spread inflammation to other towns, caused tension, then reprisals in wholesale murder, and some would settle down, and others would pass on. Shops and houses were looted or burnt Women were kidnaped. Whole villages around Dehra Dun were fired and destroyed. But still more refugees flocked into the town itself, and the quiet of a few days following the first outburst was again disturbed by the newcomers thirsting for revenge or looking for homes. The pockets of Moslems became smaller. As they were killed or after they had fled, refugees would take over their houses if they could. Many Moslems were transferred to camps for protection—refugees fleeing from refugees. Press accounts state that the military have now laid land mines outside the houses of evacuees in Dehra Dun and adjacent Mussoorie to safeguard this property from wrongful acquisition by the refugees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What about other towns, and how did they fare? Let us take one quite near, India's capital, Delhi, less than 150 miles to the south. Delhi! What about this world-renowned city, was her name also besmirched by this murderous fratricide? It was. Her feet had splashed through blood, in this mad trail of murder, arson and loot. It was the same thing over again, but on a much larger scale. What heart-rending stories have been told by impartial eyewitnesses! Such accounts show how ruthless and exacting were the killing and arson and how useless were the partial police and military who either aided or ignored the crimes they were sworn to prevent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Traveling by Rail</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What amazing conditions prevailed on the railways! Military guards were on all trains in the rioting areas. Notices appeared warning the passengers that knives and arms were not allowed to be carried. Gurkhas and Sikhs were among those excepted. Sikhs were allowed </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">kirpans</span><span class="font10"> because of their religious significance, but these must not be more than nine inches long. Hastily, before reaching Delhi one or two would stick their </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">kirpans</span><span class="font10"> into their pants, to avoid detection that theirs were more than nine inches in length. It always seemed so unjust that they should be allowed knives, while their opponents should be denied any defense whatsoever. Any Moslem traveling through these parts would have been killed as soon as spotted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Few bothered to buy tickets, for these were refugee trains. No tickets were issued to Delhi, but if you booked to a station 20 miles from Delhi and remained on the train, you got to Delhi just the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On Delhi station, where two or three weeks previously many had been killed, refugees were everywhere, sprawling out, just waiting for a train to take them somewhere where it was safe. Harrowing were the tales these had to tell of how they were deprived of everything before leaving Pakistan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One passenger recounts his experiences of traveling through Pakistan to India. He tells of a small carriage, made to hold six, and into which forty persons were crowded. Of men, women and children with their luggage, and even of goats traveling on the roof of the train. The search for Moslems in every carriage by armed men at Amritsar. The story of a man who sat through it all, and finally disclosed the fact that he was a Moslem, to a friendly Christian; had it been known before he would have been killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Trains were running between Delhi and Bombay, but there was no connection with Lahore, Let us board the Bombay train and listen to the accounts of a man who was in Lahore when the rioting took place. He is young, somewhat slim-ly built, dressed in an old khaki shirt and pants, with canvas shoes. Beyond this.he possesses nothing. As he stands outside the carriage his nervous anxiety reveals itself; one or two passers-by look at him, hesitate, and then pass on. What has he done? Nothing; it is just that he looks like a Moslem, and but for. the fact that a Sikli had traveled with him when coming out &quot;from -Pakistan he would have been killed. His nervousness is due to an experience the night before. Foolishly he had ventured outside Delhi station. At once he had been grabbed by a group of six, who were sure he was a Moslem. They decided to kill him; a policeman O.K.’d the idea. With one knife pointing at his back and another at his belly, they took him down a lane. His remonstrations that he was Christian had some effect, and they decided to find out. When they saw he was uncircumcised they let him go. All Moslems are circumcised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Just listen to the terrible accounts he gives as he recalls all he has seen. Now he is telling of the few days when he was temporarily employed as a locomotive fireman; of the time when his train was stopped, and while he and the driver were pinned down, a wholesale butchering of men, women and children took place. Listen to the accounts of the truckloads of mutilated bodies of women and men, and of children, Hindus and Sikhs who had been slaughtered in Lahore by the Moslems, of his mention of women with breasts sliced off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Should one train carrying Hindus meet or pass another train carrying Moslems, both refugee trains, there would be the danger of a pitched battle between the passengers and guards of both. The authorities in Pakistan threatened to stop refugee trains from India, as the accounts of the bestial attacks upon the refugees inflamed the inhabitants of Pakistan who heard about them to such a pitch that automatically reprisals would follow. The reading of press clippings will confirm the foregoing. Notice these newspaper extracts, given by an eyewitness:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I have seem them all . . . lying in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">most </span><span class="font10">ghastly positions, soaked in blood, their heads cracked, their stomachs ripped up—men, women and children of all ages from babes in arms to boys and girls of six, seven, eight . . , </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Qn. </span><span class="font10">Sunday one train was carrying refugees from West Punjab . . . the people in.it were shot, killed and wounded . . . Judging from those who escaped death, it is reasonable to presume that round a thousand was the casualty figure . . . Later on Monday, another </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">refugee </span><span class="font10">train arrived at Amritsar from East Punjab and, in retaliation, this train was stopped, the refugees attacked and butchered. Again the guards on the train could do but little and an English commissioned officer [perhaps the British officer referred to above] and several Indians paid with their lives. The fury of the murderers'made no distinction. I saw this train myself this morning. The stench was like the stench of Belsen, the brutality is worse than that of the Nazis. . . . Compartment after compartment were filled with the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">dead. </span><span class="font10">. . . It is just bloody murder. . . . When and how will this nightmare stop? No one knows over here. Only ■ the law of the jungle and brute force prevails. It would be different if this were a civil war or any kind of war. Then at least both sides would be armed. But this is no war of any sort. This is just plain butchery of innocent, poor, humble people to satisfy the blood lust of the armed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">To What Will This Lead?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the various parts of East Punjab and in the United Provinces, refugees and others say it will lead to war, one such stating that the idea was current that Russia would side with India and America with Pakistan. Will all this lead to war? Will it? The leaders say publicly that war is impossible, but nonetheless they know the dangerous drift into which these things can merge ; they are making all efforts to avert a catastrophe of such magnitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With praiseworthy candor, the leader of the Sikhs acknowledged the part played by their community in this brutal killing, a candor that other leaders should emulate. Among other things, this leader, Master Tara Singh, with his colleague Udham Singh Nagoke, in a press publication dated September 24, 1947, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Sikhs and Hindus have been guilty of the most shameful attacks upon women and children in the communal warfare which is still continuing, . . . Human nature shudders to think of these atrocities and we do not like to repeat these and thus give a shock to the world ... It appears that most of the Moslems, Sikhs and Hindus have gone mad. . . . We know Sikhs stooped to low depths only in retaliation for what was done by the Moslems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">India in her fight for freedom inflamed the masses, and let loose a flood of destructive outlook. One cannot agitate human waters to the extent of breaking the dam of authority and restraint, even if of foreign dominion, and then, when the dam is destroyed or removed, suddenly command the waters to stop. In their mad, headlong rush these waters gather destructive momentum, and can be diverted by another power for further destructive work against the very ones who let them loose. It is easy to destroy, but very hard to construct. Many were the warnings given to Indians before independence, but so keen—and naturally so —were they to break the yoke of foreign rule that they preferred the possibility of civil war to the continuance of British rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Perhaps this mad killing, might have been averted had the original date of June 1948, reserved for India’s independence, been kept; and a peaceful transfer of minorities have taken place under the strong British military and police power, which could have guaranteed the transfer with safety. But, in any case, Indian leaders do not favor the removal of minorities, as it enhances the two-nation argument, and the Indian Union will work for a united country again. Pakistan and the Moslem League are dead set against such union, however.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Little pinpricks and dickering for stronger positions go on. In the Kathiawar States, there is a small state, Junagadh, which has Moslem rulers with a large Hindu population, that has gone over to Pakistan. The ruler of a neighboring state says this is a Moslem plan to extend her dominion by a contemplated pincer movement; so the Hindu </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">raj </span><span class="font10">rattles its saber. Boycotting on one side ■with an influx of Moslems on the other side have taken place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As this article is being typed, the newspapers are anxious over the invasion of the independent state of Kashmir by Afridi Moslem tribes, and that Delhi has rushed troops by air in her defense, since the maharaja immediately acceded to the Indian Dominion as a result of this invasion. Just beyond lies Russia, that enigma in world politics today. Will either Pakistan or India appeal to her for aid? If so, and if she responds, then the tinder is struck for a third world war, and unhappy India must become the battlefield of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Anxiously the people watch over their new-born freedom, fearful of all the terrible portents around. Which of these, they wonder, if any, will eventually snatch their freedom from them; and what must be done to safeguard their best interests? Blinded by demonism, religion, and by its author who “hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ . . . should shine unto them”, these stumble on in darkness and in a hope that is vain. For all nations now belong to Jehovah’s appointed King, Christ Jesus, and His purpose is not to establish human governments behind national barriers, but, on the contrary, to destroy all such nations “like a potter’s vessel” and in their stead give mankind their first government of real freedom, The Theocracy.—</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> correspondent in India.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">my tongue!” the distraught one helplessly laments as he racks his brain to make memory click into action. The brow is furrowed, the chin and lips are fingered, the forehead is gently rubbed, all to coax and wheedle memory to come to the rescue and flick the elusive words off the tongue’s tip. But the words playing hide-and-seek in his brain are as slippery to his mental fingertips as frightened fish in a bowl. He cannot come to grips with intangible memory. The more he tries to drive it into action, the more like a balky mule it becomes. How the elephant, with its proverbial memory, would laugh at him! Frustrated, he gives up the quest,, relaxes, waits. Then, like an uncoiling spring the wanted words bound into the mind unbidden! Talk about artistic temperament !</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Memory may sometimes be your problem child, but are you aware of that child’s staggering problem? Into its domain of the brain the five senses tirelessly pour their flood of messages, each one of which makes an impression there that is almost beyond erasure. Daily, hourly, minutely, the sensory nerves race their messages into the brain in countless num, bers to add to the many billions of impressions already there. The newcomers join with the old to lodge with a permanence that baffles our comprehension. This retentiveness of the mind is another marvel of Jehovah God’s creature man. And still another is the marvel of memory, that it is able to pick out of these billions of impressions the one you wish to remember at a given time.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">Memory’s amazing power to draw from the voluminous mental files is demonstrated at the time of death. Persons apparently dead from drowning but later revived tell of their entire life’s passing before them in rapid review, many events long forgotten flashing in full detail. The memory propels them through the mind in a last-minute rush, working as never before, as though to unburden itself, to disgorge all its contents. Memory has amazing ability, whether the thoughts be on the tip of the tongue or in the farthermost recesses of the brain. But how does yours serve you—temperamentally, balkily, distractingly, elusively, vaguely, or reliably and faithfully?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Keep the Five Senses Alert</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">First, the information must get into the mind before it can be remembered. The stronger the impression it makes there, the easier its recall by the memory. Impressions come to the brain from the senses of seeing, hearing, touching, tasting and smelling. If the impressions are to be strong the senses must be alert, active, responsive to stimulus. Blank stares are characteristic of eyes that see not. Ears that hear not may be conscious of droning sound without awareness of the sound’s identity or meaning. Likewise many tastes and smells and bodily contacts that come to mouth and nose and skin never register consciously on the brain. Repeated ignoring of these</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">impulses causes their voice to grow weaker, dullness sets in and keenness of the senses ebbs. Most persons remember best what they take in through the eyes, though some are more ear-minded than eye-minded, gaining a stronger impression from what they receive through the ears. The three other senses make lesser impressions, but all five should collaborate to make as complete and full a mental picture of a thing as possible*</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“That reminds me?<sup>J</sup> How many times have we said this when we note a new fact and it associates itself with similar facts already in the mind! It shows the value of associating new information with the old, so that when the old is easily remembered the new also comes to mind* As an experiment, think of some word or phrase or idea, and then let the other thoughts it brings to mind flow like a stream. Certain words unlock lost memories, they undam a flood of associations, thoughts tumble out, each additional one bringing still more associated ones with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">That memory does tend to function in a chain reaction, one thought touching off another associated one, is proved in the case of committing material to memory* If, as you sail glibly along in the recitation, you suddenly forget a word or phrase, all that remains takes flight and defies capture. Seldom can you skip a portion and catch up the material at a point farther along* The loss of a link or two breaks the chain, and the forgotten links must be forged in to mend the gap before the mind will travel oh to the succeeding words and phrases* They have been learned in a certain order, set up in that association together, and in that order of association they must come, if come at all. All of which argues that, since the memory does naturally function efficiently through association of information, we do well to deliberately weld new information that we wish to remember into strong association with old and readily remembered facts in the mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Making Logical and Visual Associations</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Logical associations may be made of like things, of contrasting things, of things having a certain time in common or following one another chronologically, or having contiguity in space* Many relationships can be detected that will associate new points with one another and with older points already learned. Remembering by visual association is specially to be noted* Do you recall that this article stated that most persons are eye-minded, that is, more impressed with what they can see or visualize 1 Hence the high value to be placed upon visualization, To help readers get clear mental pictures writers use descriptive, pictureforming language, rich in rhetorical devices. Speakers do also, but they have the added advantage of being able to make explanatory and emphatic gestures that speak loudly to the hearePs eyes* Both writer and speaker focus the mental picture to a sharp clarity by giving illustrations and analogies* Thereby one can visualize and remember abstract ideas and principles, a much harder thing to do than visualizing events. Hence, to aid your memory of things conjure up mental pictures that associate with the event or idea to be remembered*</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Christ Jesus used visual association extensively* He was always presenting parables to illustrate truths, that they might be both clear and impressive to His hearers. When He wanted His followers to know how different persons would receive the truth, He did not just say so in abstract words: it was vividly visualized in the parable of the sower, whose seed (like truth) fell on different types of ground and grew or perished, depending on the soil. Again, He did not merely say Chat those who accepted Him would live and those who did not would die, but He gave His followers a visual association to which to tie these abstract truths: those who hear and believe build their house on solid rock and beating</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">storms cannot topple it over, but those who reject Him build on sand and when the rain rattles against it in torrents and swirling floods lick at its foundations and screeching winds buffet it, great is its fall.—Matthew 7:24-27; 13:1-8,18;-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The followers of Christ Jesus that were later used to write the Greek Scriptures followed His lead in this style that employed visual association. When the apostle Peter wanted to imbed in his readers’ minds the reproachfulness of those who first accept the clean truth and then reject it to return to their demon religions, he caustically compared it to a dog’s filthy habit of returning to its vomit and to the washed sow that returns to its muddy w'allow. These scenes can be made so vivid in the mind that not only can we see them but the four other senses can often be made to react to them, imagining that we can hear, smell, touch or taste things related to the scenes. Thus the five sense's come into play, and each contributes to the impression, and the impression is remembered, and when it is remembered the abstract truth it illustrates is associated with it and flashes forcefully to mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Repetition’s Role in Remembering</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah God’s Word, the Bible, stresses another vital requirement in memory training, namely, repetition. The inspired writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures were alert to the need of repetition to make the truths they preached stick safely in mind: “To repeat what I have already written does not weary me, and is the safe course for you.” (Philippians 3:1, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Twentieth Century New Testament)</span><span class="font10"> Words of instruction spoken beforehand must be reviewed and repeated to revive and refresh the memory: “This is the second letter which I have now written to you, beloved. In both I seek to revive in your sincere minds certain memories, so that you may recall the words spoken beforehand.” Also, “You are filled with knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">. . . Still, by way of refreshing your memory, I have written to you.” (2 Peter 3:1,2, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth;</span><span class="font10"> Romans 15:14,15, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt)</span><span class="font10"> The imperfect human creature is so prone to forget; to be, as it were, a ‘leaky vessel’ needing refilling from time to time. Hence, things previously studied must be reviewed, lest they slip beyond memory’s grasp: “We ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip”; or, according to the marginal reading, “run out as leaking vessels,” (Hebrews 2:1) In this respect Peter said: “I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them.” “I think it meet ... to stir you up by putting you in remembrance.” (2 Peter 1:12,13; see also 1 Corinthians 4:17; 1 Timothy 4:6; 2 Timothy 2:14; Jude 5) Yet repetition that is mechanical, parrot-like, mumbled without interest and without understanding, Christ Jesus condemned as vain repetition.—Matthew 6: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hence, in practicing repetition to aid memory, do it with interest and mental alertness and concentration. Daily we repeatedly hear common expressions, and gaze again and again at commonplace household objects; yet if called Upon to do so we probably could not accurately repeat the expressions heard or describe the objects often seen. Lacking particular interest in them, the mere repetition does not make them stick. The mind must concentrate on what is repeated. Moreover, many repetitions at a sitting are not as valuable as a few repetitions over a period of time. Memory is exercised when time intervals separate the practice periods. Statistics show that material requiring 68 repetitions in one day for mastery required only 38 repetitions when spread over a three-day period. This discloses why last-minute cramming for tests or speeches is not good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Finally, exercise the faculty of memory. How much can you think of that</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">happened last week? last month last year? Let the memory draw out events of childhood. Pluck the long-hidden thoughts from the dark nooks and crannies of the brain and bring them once more to the light of consciousness. Let memory beam back into the dim past, there to probe with its shaft of light to pick out, one here and another there, scattered thoughts that slowly piece themselves together to form more complete pictures. One thought brings forth others, and slowly and hesitantly they troop out of long hiding. It is surprising how much you can recall, if you persist for a time in the exercise. Also, try to recall as much as possible about your last walk, your last conversation, the last discourse you heard, the last article you read. Exercise the memory wnen me mind is rested and relaxed; that is when it works efficiently. Remember that when you rack your brain for words that hover on the tip of the tongue, the harder you pursue them, -th^fegtei they fly away bur that when you give up and relax, they pop into mind. Putting all the foregoing into practice will bring results that are startling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Of passing interest is psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud’s theory that we forget because we want to. The tenuous reasoning is that forgetting often saves us from disaster. A few isolated instances seem sufficient </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">to establish this theory of</span><span class="font10"> protective forgetting in modern minds seeking new fads in thinking, to be different. So if you believe it, and Johnny forgets the hamburger when you send him to the store, don’t scold; the meat was probably ground up cats and his forgetting protected the entire family, according to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Freud. </span><span class="font10">How strange, to laud forgetting </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">as a friend and </span><span class="font10">frown on remembering as an enemy! But for protection from vain philosophy and theories of fallible </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">men, forget</span><span class="font10"> Freud and learn </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font10"> valuable remembering is rated in God’s </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Perfect Memory</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Bible admonishes: “Remember the Lord, [who] is great.” “Remember now thy Creator.” “Remember his marvellous works.” “Remember all the commandments of the Loud, and do them.”’ “Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not.” (Nehemiah 4:14; Ecclesiastes 12:1; Psalm 105:5; Numbers 15:39; Proverbs 4:5) With death, memory perishes, despite the religious lies of pagan philosophers and clergymen to the contrary: “In death there is no remembrance.” “His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.” The death state is called </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“the land of forgetfulness”. </span><span class="font10">(Psalms 6:5; 146:4; 88:12) But because of Jehovah God’s memory, hope for the righteously disposed that die is sure. Job said: “Hide me in the grave, . . . appoint me a set time, and remember me!” (Job 14:13) God’s memory is perfect, and at the appointed time of resurrection He will bring forth from the grave all such as faithful Job, held by Him “in everlasting remembrance”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Yet with His perfect memory, Jehovah God has the power to forget at will. He forgets the name of the wicked and grants them no resurrection. He remembers the sin of His people no more. (Proverbs 10:7; Jeremiah 31:34) But so-called “protective forgetting” does not enable man to forget horrible thoughts. Did not Shakespeare’s bloody Macbeth futilely plead with the physician of his mad wife: “Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased, pluck from memory a rooted sorrow?” But Jehovah God can and will make faithful men forget the evils of Satan’s world: “Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former [Satan’s wicked heavens and earth] shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.” (Isaiah 65:17) Then, in that New World of righteousness, perfect man </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">with perfect memory</span><span class="font10"> will Jive forever and never forget the good things pertaining to Jehovah God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">S</span><span class="font10">PEED is the idol of this modern age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The world idolizes him who can sink his heavy boot the farthest down on the throttle and live through to tell the world of the thrill he felt. Those countries that lead the world in the modernistic touch demand not only ease and comfort, but high velocity. Their influence penetrates to the ramparts of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We, two travelers, came from one of those countries, in fact, from the world’s foremost city of this modern age. We moved from beneath the dark tunnels of tons of massed cement and steel girders to the daylight of outer New York. Racing down the Atlantic seaboard through city and hamlet, through green valleys and across desert sand, our comfortable speeding train meekly and gently halted in Miami. Here where the earth meets the sea, silver wings bore us upward and we wondered how long and to what estent our modernism could penetrate a wild, sparsely populated land like Brazil. Do they also live in our age? Can all go so easily in an untouched land of jungle wilderness ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">From the moment our passenger plane from Miami landed in the humid interior at Carolina, Maranhao, I knew that traveling in Brazil would be eventful, to say the least. Instead of the familiar modern gasoline truck trolling out to fill up the plane’s tanks, a crew of men rolled large oil drums over to the plane and pumped in the gas by hand. Then, with everyone on board again and ready to take off, and both motors warmed up and going full speed, the plane wouldn’t budge 1 It had slipped off the narrow runway and sunk into the mud that had formed after the rain that day, and now everyone, passengers and airport workers, was asked to lend a hand to “pull ’er out”. Just like pulling out the old Ford flivvers back in the States, only that here was a modern, streamlined plane in the same predicament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Only a few more hours in the air and before us spread out the world-famous, breath-taking panorama of Rio de Janeiro and its bay, basking in golden, tropical sunshine. As the plane circled downward and in for a landing, it was easy to make out Sugar-Loaf mountain off to the left, the modern city of Rio with many tall skyscrapers spread out below, Niteroi across the bay, and Corcovado peak off to the right. The only thing that man had made to .compete with the natural beauty to these rugged mountains and cliffs that nestled up to and overshadowed the water’s edge was the enormous giant mounted on Corcovado’s summit, with arms outspread to represent Christ. At night, as floodlights are trained on this image, the illusion is created of a fluorescent Christ riding in on a cloud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A quick landing on the short runway of the Santos Dumont airport ended this feast for the eye, but by no means .did it end exciting travel for us. With no trouble getting through customs, we were off on a wild taxi-ride through the heart of town to the Branch office of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, where </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">our </span><span class="font10">Kio friends awaited us. It seemed as if we were right back in the tangling, snarling traffic of New York, or Chicago, or Los Angeles. I lost track of counting how many jay-walkers we almost hit. The horn seemed more important than the brake. The way our driver took corners on two wheels, it seemed as if the other two were yet being rationed. And don’t ask about the fee he charged us, since he could easily recognize us as foreigners and with no ability to express ourselves in Portuguese.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bonde*</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">That evening we thought we would travel by a slower, safer way, the trolley car; but we didn’t labor under that delusion very long. These trolleys, called “bondes” (and pronounced “bon-dees”, which name originated from the English word “bonds”), are open, with wooden benches and no center aisle, and are entered by mounting narrow running boards upon which also the surplus passengers can stand en route. Being nearly always driven like mad, they rock perilously from side to side as they rush along cobbled streets. Men will hop on or off these </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">bondes</span><span class="font10"> while they are in motion. Yes, some do get hurt or killed now and then trying'this stunt, but it doesn’t seem to deter others from doing the same thing every day. At rush hours, it is incredible the number of people that crowd into these cars. On occasions men clamber up on top of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">bondes</span><span class="font10"> as well; Women will crowd into the narrow passageways between benches and stand there sandwiched tightly together, l,f a man offers his seat to a woman or to an elderly man, he climbs out onto the running board with the other hangers-on called “pingentes”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And then, the conductor. Always afraid that someone has not yet paid his fare, he clambers monkey-style over the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">pingentes</span><span class="font10"> and cries out, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Fas favor!” </span><span class="font10">(&quot;Please!”), coaxing and persuading everyone to pay, and stopping now and then to argue with someone who claims to have already paid. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">bonde</span><span class="font10"> fare is very low in Brazil—about one cent American money. The recent raise in the fare to 2| cents in Sao Paulo raised a near riot, and organized mobs burned and destroyed many </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">bondes</span><span class="font10"> and buses, and thus induced an even greater crisis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">motonnan or ear driver</span><span class="font10"> hits a pedestrian, he abandons his vehicle and runs for his life lest he implicate the traction company or an angry mob form against him. Usually he will later yield himself </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">to the</span><span class="font10"> police </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">voluntarily and</span><span class="font10"> before they go looking for him. Now, don’t get the idea from this that the average Brazilian goes around with an ungovernable temper. He doesn’t. He is nearly always </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">friendly, starting a conversation </span><span class="font10">at the slightest pretext with anyone who happens to be near and is willing to listen to him. If you ask street directions, not only will several speak up right away and offer you </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">assistance in finding </span><span class="font10">a place, but many will even take you there personally even though it be out of their way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One more item about </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">bondes.</span><span class="font10"> Something used here of great </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">service, which is</span><span class="font10"> not seen in the States, is “freight </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">bondes&quot;.</span><span class="font10"> These aid one to transport large packages, crates, machinery or even one’s entire household furniture to various parts of the city, at very reasonable rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Maria Furnace.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Outstanding among the varied train systems in Brazil are Rio’s electric trains, similar to New York’s “L” trains, that feed the suburbs. These travel rapidly, and the fare is low. The only trouble is, trying to use them at rush hours. Though neat wafting </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">lines</span><span class="font10"> are formed in Dom Pedro II station, they immediately disappear in the mad rush for seats that follows the opening of train doors. At each succeeding station one must be quick to get out, or else the incoming, pushing crowd blocks the exit and it would take more than an All-American tackle to buck that determined line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On the majority of the railroad lines, some of which are narrow-gauge, the old-fashioned steam engine is used, fondly called by the Brazilians “Maria Fu-maciir (Smoky Mary). She is true to her name. Watch her coming along, leading forth hissing steam on all sides,' and billowing forth voluminous clouds of black smoke and soot that settles over everything, There are, however, some streamliners, and Diesel engines are taking the place of steam between Rio and Sao Paulo, part of which line is already electrified, Train schedules on most lines do not mean too much, and it is not uncommon for a train to come in hours late. First-class travel is comparable to second-class in the States, and the second-class offers the ordinary trolley-car type of seat. As most other means of transportation in Brazil, the trains are always overcrowded, and women with children in their arms frequently will journey a whole night through standing up. Still, it is better and faster than riding by horse and wagon, as so many do, or taking an oxcart drawn by white zebus, Vhich animals are common here. Others will strike out on foot rather than take a train. Some of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">caipiras</span><span class="font10"> (hillbillies) dread train travel and will walk many kilometers, frequently with a heavy load balanced on the head, rather than take a train.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Jardineiras”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Buses also help one get around. The buses in the city are tolerable, some very modern ones having been imported, but the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">jardineira</span><span class="font10"> of the interior is an actual miracle, seeing that such old, broken-down jalopies can still run. There you sit, on low, wooden benches close to the floor, with your knees doubled sharply. Lack of shock absorbers on these rattletraps means that the passenger must absorb any and all shocks. Usually there are no windows, and the only feeble protection against heavy downpour is a cloth flap which serves to concentrate all the individual drops of rain into one steady stream that drips into your shoes or onto the back of your neck from your neighbor’s flap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In many parts of the states of Sao Paulo and Parana there is a rich, red earth which, when dry, is as fine as powder and stains one’s clothes and body, and, when wet, cakes on one’s shoes until they become the size of the proverbial millstones and feel just about as •heavy. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">jardineira</span><span class="font10"> skids on this red clay worse than on ice, and you frequently find the car skidding along broadside on these dirt roads they travel, splashing mud onto all the trees that line the highway, and finally ending up in some ditch. Then alb passengers have to hop out and push the bus out of the sticky, red day, in the midst of a steady, drenching rain and with several pounds of mud clinging to each shoe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Bridges are lacking very often, and the only means of crossing rivers or streams is by way of rafts. These are usually large enough to hold a bus or truck. A wire cable stretched across from bank to bank keeps the raft from floating downstream, and the force of two Strong men tugging on this cable is sufficient to help pull the raft across to the other side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cable Train</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Just time to mention one more interesting item in Brazilian travel. It is the engineering feat of stretching a railroad from the seaport of Santos to Sao Paulo over a mountain range, the “Serra do Mar”. The train is enabled to climb over 800 meters (2,625 feet) within the short distance of 10 kilometers (about 6£ miles), and pass over the mountains and continue into Sao Paulo. The stunt is done with specially-braked locomotives and cables, and a seesaw arrangement, as follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">An ordinary locomotive pulls all the train coaches to the first landing of the five inclined planes. The train is then divided into several sections of coaches, each of which sections is then attached individually to a special locomotive calleci oco-brake having especially strong clutch brakes that are built to secure on inclined rails, as well as having emergency rail-hooks that can also be used. This </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Loco-brake</span><span class="font10"> engine hooks onto a powerful cable that runs along between the rails up to the next landing and then back down again. On this upper landing is another train waiting to come, down, which is also attached to the same cable. Thus, as one train goes up with the aid of the moving cable, the other comes down, and the weights of the two trains counterbalance each other. At the upper landing, the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">loco-brake</span><span class="font10"> unhooks from the cable and pulls the coaches to the next cable where it hooks on, repeating the same process until the train comes over the fifth inclined plane and is joined again to an ordinary steam locomotive, ready to head for the teeming city of Sao Paulo, the Chicago of Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Train sections follow each other at nine-minute intervals, the time*it takes to go from one level to another. There is little danger of these cables’ breaking, since they are really several strong cables intertwined and approximately two inches in diameter. They travel along smoothly and continuously over 4,800 rotating, plow-shaped pairs of wheels, evenly spaced along the tracks. Interesting, also, is the fact that three rails are used instead of four, the left rail and the center one employed in ascending and the center rail and the right</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19480122_files/g_E_19480122-7.png" alt="" style="width:208pt;height:192pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">one in descending, and using double sets of rails only at points where trains pass each other midway along the cable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At each landing underground are 1000-horsepower traction machines with large, braked wheels which the cables loop five times. Tn east of emergency these wheels can secure the cable and arrest the trains moving along the inclined planes. So, in addition to the counterbalance of the trains, and the protection through the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">loco-brakes,</span><span class="font10"> there is also an added counterweight, at each level, of 7 tons by these tremendous underground brakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A most interesting feature of this engineering maneuver is that it was not done recently. In fact, the railroad was first built in 1867 with 4 inclined planes and later rebuilt with 5 inclined planes, in 1900. It may, however, soon be outmoded by fast bus transportation that was recently instituted at the completion of a new paved highway from Sao Paulo to Santos, with buses leaving the terminals every fifteen minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is no doubt that better transportation facilities, new modern highways, greater airlines, are opening up vast horizons of Brazil. Comfortable buses and new bridges will get one places. Before long, there will be appearing more of those new streamlined trains, such as speed along so silently and swiftly that one needs to look out the window at passing objects to realize one is in motion. But until then travelers in Brazil can continue to enjoy their open </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">bondes,</span><span class="font10"> their skidding </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">jardineiras,</span><span class="font10"> their smoking, tooting Smoky Marys, and, though travel may be a little slower and somewhat more inconvenient here than in other more highly favored countries, the principal thing is that one </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">can</span><span class="font10"> get. around in Brazil. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">—Awake!</span><span class="font10"> correspondent in Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">F</span><span class="font10">OR thousands of years seals romped and played upon the high seas with little fear of enemies. Living peacefully with other mammals in the animal realm they ate only a sufficient number of fish to satisfy their hunger and were diligent to carry out the duties of propagating their own species* Such was the happy state of affairs in this aquatic home until man, through lust and greed, degenerated to the level of a ruthless, insatiable and wanton killer of these sleek and graceful creatures*</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To the Greeks a seal was a<sup>+</sup>seal, and in honor of the creatures they named one of their towns Phocaea (now Foca). Aristotle made no distinction, but put all seals in the same classification. However, in seal society there are several distinct members: some are rather common folks, some are mentally dull, some are huge fellows, some are wealthy aristocrats, some are quite intelligent, and some are regular clowns. The group as a whole is divided into two classes, the true seals or hair seals and the so-called “fur<sup>p</sup> seals. In the former group are the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">harp</span><span class="font10"> or </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">saddleback</span><span class="font10"> seals, which are found on the ice floes west of Greenland and along the coast of Labrador; the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">ringed </span><span class="font10">seals; the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">hooded</span><span class="font10"> seals, whose home is east of Greenland; the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">gray</span><span class="font10"> seals, which live in the north Atlantic ; the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Caspian </span><span class="font10">seals, found in the Asiatic sea by that name; the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">elephant</span><span class="font10"> seals, with the flexibleproboscides, which live on the fringes of the Antarctic ice pack, and the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">common</span><span class="font10"> or </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">harbor</span><span class="font10"> seals, which are found in widely scattered places around the globe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The fur seals are likewise divided into several species, there being two main groups or genera, those living in the Southern Hemisphere and those of the Northern Hemisphere. The biologists, however, protest against these fur-bearing creatures' belonging to the common society of seals. “Why/ they say, “they have ears! and w<sup>T</sup>ho ever heard of a real seal having ears'? They resemble bears more than seals?' And there are internal differences too, not to mention the fact that those that wear the precious furs instead of the common coats of hair practice polygamy. But we are not all biologists, and, besides, the fur seals share the same sorrows in common with the hair seals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Harps</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When the spring floe begins to wheedle an icy carpet with its jagged frills through the Davis straits between Greenland and Baffin island, there to be carried southward by the Labrador current, hundreds of thousands of awkward and cumbersome yet beautiful seals climb atop, for a free ride. Their barking blends with the crackling of the floe and their rippling hides tingle with the prospects of their tribal duties. It is mating time. “Harp<sup>v</sup> seals they are called, because of the brown markings on their cream-while hair. Their heads are rather small and they wear their whiskers well* And look at those big, brown and beautiful eyes with their wmtery depth and charm!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">About the last of February or the first of March this massive herd has pupped on the whelping grounds the floe transformed into a huge nursery containing</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">thousands of baby harps that look for all the world like giant, downy white powder puffs weighing seven to nine pounds. The babies grow very rapidly, from one and a half to three pounds a day, so if the mother goes afishin’ she must first scrape together a heap of snow and squeeze upon it a good supply of rich milk to keep her young one contented. No matter how far the ice pan shifts while she is down below (sometimes these seals’dive as deep as 2,000 feet for their food) she always comes back to her own little puppy. Such deep-sea diving is made possible by the reserve supply of oxygenated blood carried in a storeroom in their lungs. By the time April comes the little white coats of the babies are no longer little nor are they white. Becoming spotted, they are called “raggedy-coats”, a change that marks the time when they forsake the ice and swim northward to their icecap home on the world’s rooftop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Away from the main herd, called the “main patch” are other patches of young seals called “bedlamers”, ranging in age from one to three years. Not until their fourth year do they start thinking about the problems of marital life, that is, if they are among the fortunate few that escape being butchered by the hand of their great enemy, man, for about the time their newborn baby brothers and sisters are changing their coats great preparations are being made by men for their slaughter. Out of St. John’s, Newfoundland, sealing fleets have been sailing at this time of year since 1763. As many as 400 vessels and 10,000 men engaged in this business during the years 1830 to 1850 and their catch ranged from 500,000 to 700,000 seals a year. What these sealers are after is the two-inch layer of fat that lies beneath the seal’s skin and which is highly prized as a source of oil; the hides are used by the leather industry. And because only the young are killed, and no thought has been given to systematic conservation of the stock during the years, the herds have been greatly depleted and the grief of the seals has been increased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Sealing methods consist of going through a herd and clubbing the young non-resistant animals over the head. This done, the sealers remove the skins with the fat attached. The whole job is one that is engaged in only by men who are willing to gamble their lives and endure untold hardships for a little glittering wealth that is theirs when, and if, their ship returns safely to port with a cargo of pelts. Those that reap the real fat of the sea are the avaricious merchants that own the fleets, and not the club-wielders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hooded and Elephant Seals Also Hunted</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The hooded seal gets his name from the loose skin structure that is worn obliquely over the top of his head like a Spanish beret. This loose skin is puffed up into a hard and odd-looking cap when he is angered, and, unlike the quiet and humble harps, the hoods are easily excited, especially the old males. They know no fear and will attack a man on ice or in a boat if provoked, and the females will die with their pups rather than forsake them. But, for all their fierceness toward their enemy man, the hoods live peacefully with their cousins the harps. The species is much larger than the harps, and when fully grown measure nine feet long and weigh about 700 pounds. Though they are less valuable commercially, having tougher hides and a coarser fat, yet they are hunted down by British and Norwegian sealers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the Antarctic the Weddell sgals come up on the ice in October (springtime down there) and give birth to 75-pound babies that are half the length of their mothers. Eight weeks later, when they are weaned, they weigh as much as 300 pounds; their daddies reach the half-ton mark with a full armor of blubber under the skin. And if it were not for this blubber they would not be hunted down and killed off by their worst enemy, man. The killer whales are also their natural enemies, but from such they protect themselves out of the mating season by living under the ice, coming up at the numerous blow holes for air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In the High Society of Fur Seals</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It was not until mariners rounded the Cape of Good Hope in 1486 that Europeans saw their first fur-bearing seals, several species of which inhabited the island rookeries around the Antarctic circle and off the coasts of South America, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. At first, and up to the eighteenth century, it seems, these seals were not distinguished from the common hair seals. Then, in 1741, when a Russian expedition was shipwrecked and marooned on an island in the Bering sea off the coast of Siberia, there being among the survivors a natural scientist by the name of Stellar, the discovery was made that fur seals are quite different from other seals, especially in their habits of living. Stellar called them &quot;sea bears&quot;. Years later another Russian, by the name of Pribilof, discovered other islands north of the Aleutians that were inhabited solely by fur seals, and today the most densely populated seal rookeries in the world are on these Pribilof islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The social life of northern fur seals is very interesting, distinctly different from that of the harp and common seals. Toward the end of April the sooty-brown bull seals arrive at the rookeries and take up their stations along the shore as “beachmasters”. A month later there is great excitement when the silver-furred cows begin to come out of the water, for each bull is out to capture as many females as possible, and those that sign a contract are married to him for the season. Thirty or so is an average for these harems, though sometimes a kingly beachmaster is successful in getting as many as a hundred wives for his household. Because the males, weighing 400 to 500 pounds, are so much bigger than the females some thought the males were the mothers and the females their children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Between these harems that line the shores are “streets” leading from the water’s edge to the interior, along which the adolescent males known as “bachelors” are permitted to come and go.'And woe be unto the careless upstart that violates the laws of sealdom and gets too near a harem. Mr. Bull seal will give him a thrashing he never forgets, provided, of course, that he survives the painful tutoring. Until these young fellows are old enough, at least seven years old, to go into the harem business themselves, they live in the bachelor’s quarters called “pods” in the interior of the island, known as the “parade grounds”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What a busy life these seals lead in the rookeries! Within a day or two after the cows arrive they give birth to a pup that was conceived the season before. Then within three to seven days they again come into heat and mate, since nearly a year is required for gestation. Conception so soon after giving birth is made possible by the seal cow’s possession of two wombs, which are used alternately. All the time the mother is nursing her fast-growing baby but she realizes that unless she gets food herself she will not be able to feed her offspring. This means a 300-mile round trip to the fishing grounds, which takes two days to make. For a while she alternates feeding the young one and feeding herself, but as the puppy grows larger he is able to go longer between meals, so that by the time he is weaned he is being fed every five days. During this six-week period the daddy also has his hands full. In fact, he is so active looking after his growing household, taking care of his duties and keeping a sharp eye open lest his neighbor steal one of his wives, that he has absolutely ne time to eat or sleep, night or day. It takes a lot out of him, so that by the end of the season, instead of being the fat and well-rounded fellow he was, he is little more than a shadow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Born in a black, shining wrap, the youngsters get a winter coat of darkgray before they leave the islands-with their </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">mothers</span><span class="font10"> for a winter cruise to points south. It is believed they travel as far as the temperate, waters off the coast of southern California before- returning. The mature males, however, lean and gaunt, do not travel so far, but take it easy, sleeping and eating and growing fat for the next season’s ordeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Story of Slaughter and Slavery</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At first the pelts of the fur seal were considered worthless, until an ingenious Chinese furrier discovered a secret way of removing the long guard-hair that protects the soft fur beneath, a discovery which sounded the death knell for the fur seal. A new era opened up. Russia began </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">to build</span><span class="font10"> a great seal </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">empire in the </span><span class="font10">north. Ruthlessly the czar’s henchmen forced the native Aleutians into a form of torturdus slavery as fheir sealers, the blood-chilling details of which were long ago buried in the Arctic snow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The seal rush was on, and other nations sent their buccaneers to fleece the rookeries of the Southern </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Hemisphere. </span><span class="font10">So terrible the plunder and so ghastly the waste that it was not long before several species of the fur seal were extinct. By 1840 as many as 16,000,000 pelts had been sent to market, a figure that only serves as an in-dex to the unnumbered millions that were wantonly killed and and whose skins were never used. A single example of the waste was the cargo of 400,000 beautiful | pelts that rotted en route to Lon- </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">m </span><span class="font10">don from Australia, in 1821, and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">M </span><span class="font10">were sold, as a consequence, for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">/K </span><span class="font10">manure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">/ Bible</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When the United States acquired</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">quired Alaska from Russia, in 1867, for $7,200,000, the Pribilof </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">islands </span><span class="font10">islands were tossed in for good W A measure. At that time the fur- </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">fur-seal </span><span class="font10">seal population was estimated at </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:line-through;">I</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">4,500,000. By 1897 only 400,000 remained in the herd and the price of a pelt had risen from $2.50 to $30. Such depletion was due, to a large extent, to the practice of seal pirates and poachers who killed the females at sea in their feeding grounds. The horrors of this practice, known as pelagic killing, were made visible by the hundreds of thousands of dead puppies that had starved to death on the beaches because their mothers never returned to suckle them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Finally, after years of senseless slaughtering, controls were set up, and since 1910, when the fur-seal dynasty of the Pribilofs was down to a remnant of 130,000, a herd has been built up that now numbers about 2,000,000. Provisions allow for the killing of only fifty or sixty thousand a year, and then these are supposed </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">to be taken only from the surplus </span><span class="font10">three- and four-year-old “bachelors” that wear velvety silver-gray fleeces. Nor has this practice made the sealing business unprofitable, for in a period of eighteen years, from 1910 to 1928, the government took in more than $50,000,000 from seal furs, an amount seven times as great as the purchase price of all Alaska!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Many of the circus seals and those found in the zoos are of a certain species found along the coast of Santa Barbara, California. “Sealpunchers” lasso them as cowpunchers rope a calf, and deliver them anywhere in the coun-try with a money-back guarantee if they are not in good condition. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font10"> These particular seals are more intelligent than other species, but k &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they too have their sorrows, for</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">N</span><span class="font10">OT since Columbus discovered</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">America has the world seen such a mad rush by the nations to stake out claims of ownership on a new and little-known continent as is taking place today. A dozen countries—Britain, United States, France, Belgium, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Russia, Japan, Argentina,, Chile, New Zealand and Australia—have sent more than 170 missions to the bottom of the world; thousands of men have risked their lives (many lost their lives) wrestling with the uncompromising elements ; and millions of dollars from government treasuries have been poured into the battle with the polar giant of the Antarctic. For many years south pole expeditions were nothing more than a manifestation of man’s curiosity and his desire to explore the unknown, but since World War II the atomic age has kindled a flaming military interest in this frozen waste land. Hence in deadly earnest the conquest of earth’s last continent is now pushed as never before!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Here is a continent five or sixmillion square miles in area. This makes it a third larger than all of Europe or almost twice the size of the United States! But instead of being a land of fertile valleys and rich forest reserves it is' the world’s most extensive barren and lifeless land mass. There are no land animals and no flowering plants in the 'Antarctic, and aside from a few, a very few, birds, insects and lichens it is altogether uninhabited and devoid of any form of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The pride and glory of the Antarctic is its cold and snow, both of which it has in superabundance. Surrounding the continent is ice that is 500 feet thick in places. The land mass itself is very high, averaging 6,000 feet in altitude, which is twice the height of any other continent. On top of this is an eternal pile of snow, the greatest in the -world. Huge mountain ranges higher than the Alps, with 20,000-foot peaks, cut across the continent in several directions. Here and there are active volcanoes. The south pole itself is reached only if one ascends a great plateau 10,000 feet high, where storms are the worst in the world. Wind velocities, it is said, reach 200 miles an hour, and the winter cold touches a solid 90 degrees below zero on the Fahrenheit scale. There is a “summertime” down there during January and February, when the ice shelf thaws a little and mammoth icebergs the size of</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">New </span><span class="font10">York's Manhattan island break off, but by early April winter again takes hold and strengthens its cold death grip on this forbidding continent</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Why, you ask, would any nation be so desperately anxious to grab control of such “frozen assets” as these? To study weather conditions is one reason advanced, for it is supposed that long-range predictions on northern hemispheric weather can be made by studying meteorological data of the Antarctic. To search for oil is another reason given; to gain control of the whaling industry, and to prospect for coal and minerals, are still other excuses. The whaling industry is now a $15,000,000-a-year business, but, strictly speaking, it is a Ashing industry that is governed by international laws of the high seas. Low-grade coal, together with copper, manganese, tin and molybdenum, have been found, but because of their location these are of little value today and it will take a hundred years to develop them. Consequently there is another reason for the heated activity in that frigid country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It had only to be whispered around that there was </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">uranium</span><span class="font10"> buried in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span class="font10">Antarctic icecap and the appetite of the avaricious militarists was whetted to such an extent that they desired to swallow the whole continent at once, icebergs included. Ah, uranium, the basic metal that makes possible atomic fission, that enables demonic men to produce atomic bombs, that enables devils bent on world rule to wipe out in a moment whole cities that resist their enslaving rule! Little wonder, then, with the whole world trembling with fear of another war, that the rumor of possible traces of this rare metal in the Antarctic touched off an international uranium rush that paralleled the California and Alaska gold rushes. Interested governments sent many scientists with elaborate technical equipment.,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;Operation High Jump”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This was the name of the U. S. Navy's expedition that went to the Antarctic a year ago under the command of Admirals Byrd and Cruzen. It consisted of an armada of twelve vessels that carried thousands of tons of equipment and supplies (the taxpayers footed the bill), most of which was left there for the penguins as a total and extravagant loss. Also a personnel army of 4,000 hand-picked scientists and technicians went </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">along.</span><span class="font10"> Arriving at the Ross Shelf, the solid glacial ice that stretches over the Ross Sea some 400 miles long and 400 miles wide and which rises out of the water 50 to 200 feet and extends downward ten or eleven times as far into the water, the Byrd expedition landed and set up its “Little America” headquarters. From here the most extensive exploration of the continent ever made was launched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In two months’ time 1,700,000 square miles of territory was photographed and mapped, which achievement was greater than that accomplished by all previous expeditions put together. This was also a uranium mapping operation, for the planes used to do the aerial photographing were equipped with uranium detecting devices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For military reasons the people were not told what was learned from the uranium radiation counters, but instead the “most spectacular discovery” of the whole expedition was said to be the discovery of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">ice-free glacial lakes on the </span><span class="font10">ice-bound continent. With this announcement imagination ran wild with the idea that perhaps there was an “oasis” heated by subterranean volcanic energy. Months later, however, a short notice in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">newspaper told</span><span class="font10"> how the ice-free “lakes” were nothing more than a backwash of sea water lying in shallow basins of black lava rock that retained the sun’s heat during the several months of continual daylight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another “discovery” made was that the Antarctic is the world’s greatest icebox, where food crops during bumper years could be put in cold storage as a reserve for a time of war. Funny, isn’t it, how these fellows while talking peace always think in terms of war. And because they are so fearful of another war they feverishly prepare for it. Declared Byrd, “the security of the United States for the next hundred years lies in the polar regions”; and his associate commander, Cruzen, thinks that the Antarctic cannot be left out of any future military strategy. If Germany was able to establish a submarine base down in the Antarctic during the recent war, they reason, the next time they can do the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For these reasons the United States continues to push its surveying and mapping project. Another expedition under the command of Ronne remained through the last Antarctic winter in an area not covered by last year’s Byrd expedition. Minimizing the military significance, the public press played up the fact that this was the first expedition to the Antarctic to boast of having two women in its supplies, Ronne's wife and the wife of the chief pilot. Then, last November, with the approach of another southern summer, the United States sent 450 men and scientists back to Little America on another mission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Other nations are likewise eyeing the military importance of the Antarctic. Last year the Russians sent a flotilla of ten whaling vessels down there, presumably to do a little fishing of their own. In the middle of the recent war Britain saw that sooner or later the conquest of the Antarctic would be made, and so in 1943 she quietly set up so-called “weather stations” down there on an all-year “permanent resident” basis, and they are still there in operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Because the Antarctic is a natural and logical base from which to launch an attack on South America, South Africa,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Australia or New Zealand, these countries are concerned over which nations presume to fly their flags from the south pole. Australia claims she has conquered 2,500,000 square miles of the continent. France claims the section nearest Madagascar. Norway’s flag was the first to fly from the south pole, in 1911. Chile has made great claims for the section lying between 53° W. and 90° W. longitude. Argentina’s and Britain’s claims also overlap in this section, so Chile and Argentina have pooled their claims. Each country has its peculiar reasons why it is entitled to certain sections of this land of icebergs, but none seems more fantastic than those advanced by Chile. “Look,” she says, “the geological formation of the Antarctic mountains, together with their deposits of minerals, is the same as that of the Andes, hence they belong to Chile though separated by many hundreds of miles of ocean.” By such “reasoning” the Peruvian mountains immediately to the north also belong to Chile, and because the Rocky Mountains of North America are also of the same general chain, they too belong to the elongated but narrow(-mind-ed?) country of Chile!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">How apparent it is that even if the bickering nations of this old Satanic world fully conquer this vast continent at the bottom of the world they will continue to contest and squabble over it. God-fearing people of all nations, however, who lift themselves above this common din of sword-rattling see the Rightful Owner of the earth, Jehovah God, moving majestically on in His purpose to crush out the present rebellious nations .and establish in their place His glorious Theocratic Government that will maintain peace over the entire earth throughout all eternity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus Denies the “’Trinity”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">HE religious clergymen of Christendom, the trinitarian bloc thereof, teach that Jesus Christ was His own father. Oh, yes, they do! and there’s no denying it, no matter how impossible it may sound. The very unreasonable impossibility of what they teach shows they do not tell the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The true relationship between Almighty God and Jesus Christ is that of Father and Son, with all that this implies and with all that this debars. His son-ship to God Jesus Christ always acknowledged. He said: “For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth.” (John 5: 20) The term “father” implies the position of life-giver to the son; and life, existence, beginning, is -what God the Father gave to His Son our Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus’ own words prove this, thereby showing that He did not claim to be His own father and was not one in substance with His Father and eo-eternal with His Father, as the trinitarians claim. On this point Jesus said; “As the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; and hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because' he is the Son of man.” From these words of Jesus, at John 5:26,27, let the people determine whether or not Jesus here told the truth; and if so, then they must conclude that the clergy who teach the trinitarian doctrine are false witnesses and really antichrists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jesus repeatedly spoke of himself as the Son of God, and, because “son” means one that receives life from a parent, this shows He was not His own father nor ever claimed to be. He said: “Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.” Hence Jesus was not asking the once-blind man to believe on a “trinity” when Jesus asked him: “Dost thou believe on the Son of God?” (John 6:27; </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">9: </span><span class="font10">35) Again Jesus confessed to have received life as a son from a heavenly Father, when Lazarus His friend became sick and the news of that fact was borne to the attention of Jesus. Then He said: “This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.” Before witnesses He prayed to His own Lifegiver and said: “Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. And I knew that thou hearest me always; but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.” (John 11:4,41,42) </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">If the </span><span class="font10">trinitarian clergy are right in their theological teachings, then Jesus in here using the tender term “Father” was practicing a subterfuge. But as a denouncer of hypocrisy He was too honest and true to practice a subterfuge, and He was here praying to God as His Father or Life-giver’in deed and in fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When instructing His disciples concerning their privilege of praying to their Father as well as His, Jesus did not say'they ought to pray to Him as one equal and cosubstantial with the Father, but He directed their attention away from Him and taught them to say: “After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed he thy name.” (Matthew 6: 9) Distinguishing himself as a son separate and distinct from His Father, Jesus also said: “And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father maybe glorified in the Son.”-John 14:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jesus addressed His heavenly Father and spoke of His Father above in just the same way that we as children of God would speak of Him, namely, as Lifegiver, which a father is. Jehovah God is the great Life-giver to all that He created to enjoy intelligent life. He gave life to Jesus, His only begotten Son; and the term “begotten” means one whose existence has been begun by a parent. God sent this Son to the earth to lay the basis for the reconciling of faithful men to himself, that He might give life to one-dient men through this Son. Man partakes of material food for the sustaining of his body. Jesus likened himself to bread, in this, that faith in Him and in His shed blood and in His work that the Father sent Him to do leads the believers to where they can get food for life eternal. Therefore concerning the giving of life Jesus said: “As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father [thus denoting His own dependence upon God for life]: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.” (John 6:57) Jesus’ dependence upon God for life just as we are dependent upon Jesus for life proves that Jesus is not His own father and that He denied a “trinity”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In His last instruction period with His disciples Jesus taught them about the way that leads to life. In order for any one to have eternal life he must get into harmonious relationship with God, the great Father from whom all life issues to all creation. So Jesus said: “I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” (John 14:6) Because no one could get to the original Life-giver except through Jesus His Son, there Jesus said He himself was the way and the life. If He were at one and the same time “God the Father and God the Son”, the same in substance and inseparable, then Jesus would not have said that to get to the Father the believer has to go through Jesus. Thus Jesus denied the “trinity”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He taught His disciples He must go away and that He would come back and receive them to himself after setting up the Kingdom for which they prayed. His disciples asked when that would be and how they might know when this world would come to its final end to make way for Kingdom rule. Jesus answered: “Of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of.heaven, but my Father only.” (Matthew 24: 36) Does that mean that even Jesus did not know? Yes, for Mark 13:32 reports Jesus as saying: “But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.” If, when Jesus spoke those words, He was equal in power and one in substance with God the Father, as the religious clergy claim, then He would have known when the final universal war would break out. Again He denied the “trinity”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The foregoing quotations of Jesus’ utterances are simple means by which to test the genuineness of the unexplainable, confusing “trinity” doctrine, but they are nonetheless powerful charges to explode the heathenish doctrine of the “trinity”. Jesus’ simple words are to be taken for -what they mean, and they plainly show a distinctness between God the Father and Jesus the Son of God. They prove that Jesus did not at any time speak from the standpoint of a so-called “trinity”. His last utterance to one of His apostles on earth was: “These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God.” (Revelation 3:14) He was the first of God’s creatures and was the “only begotten Son”. Thereby He made a final denial of the “trinity” and glorified the Fatherhood of God the Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Christendom’s Three-headed God</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">T</span><span class="font10">RINITARIANS, whether they know it or not, are worshipers of Satan the Devil. What a rash statement this would be were it not for the overwhelming and irrefutable evidence to prove it! Evidence that is strong enough to convince the most skeptical persons, provided they are honest enough to admit the facts. In the December 22,1947, issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> the reader was given a glimpse 'into Christendom’s cellar and shown that her very foundations are of pagan origin. Likewise if the masking paint is scraped off Christendom’s superstructure of doctrines and teachings, one of the foremost of which is the doctrine of the “holy trinity”, they too appear as nothing more than a monstrous fabrication of heathen mythologies that have been built up by the Devil for the purpose of reproaching and blaspheming the true and living God, whose name alone is Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Nowhere in the Bible is the word “trinity” to be found. Yet Catholics and the majority of Protestants believe and teach such doctrine which was set forth in the Nicene Creed A.D. 325 after weeks of debate. The main dispute at that council, where apostate Christianity was fused with paganism, was over who should compose the “trinity”. One group, holding to the old pagan idea of fathermother-child, insisted that Mary be included; while another faction wanted to see the so-called “holy ghost” embraced in the triad. Finally Constantine, the compromising pagan politician, found a solution by having Mary placed at the right hand of Her son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Prior to its official adoption into the Catholic church, Dupin says, &quot;the word trinity, or trinity, was borrowed from the pagan schools of philosophy, and introduced into the theology of the Christians of the middle of the second century, by Theophilus, Bishop of Antioch.* </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Biblio-'theque Ecclesiastique)</span><span class="font10"> Many of the early “church fathers” were most reprehensible in that they had access to the truth contained in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Bible yet they </span><span class="font10">precisely taught the trinitarian philosophy of the Greek pagan named Plato. Among such was Origen, called “the father of Christian Platonism”, and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">bishop.</span><span class="font10"> Synesius, who followed the female philosopher Hypatia and fused in his hymns the heathenish “doctrine of the trinity with the Platonic idea of God, and the Savior with the divine Helios the sun god of the heathen]”. (Philip Schaff's </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">History of the Christian Church</span><span class="font10"> It was at this time that ambitious pagans joined up with the so-called Christians, and these, says McClintock &amp; Strong  </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Cyclopaedia^</span><span class="font10"> &quot;brought with them Iimr me Christian schools of theology their Platonic ideas and phraseology, and they especially borrowed from the philosophical writings of Philo.” The Valentinians and Marcionites, who were gnostics that taught a very rank form of demonism, were also responsible for grafting in the “trinity” idea to the early Christian church.—See Beausobre’s </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Historic du Manicheisme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Universal Doctrine Among Pagans</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Delving deeper into the black mystery of the “trinity” it is learned that Plato was not the first to believe and teach this inconsistent doctrine. Long centuries before Christ and Plato were on earth the devil-worshipers of Egypt and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon </span><span class="font10">believed in a three-headed god. It is therefore no coincidence that Christendom’s “trinity” doctrine, so similar to that of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Greeks, is also identical in</span><span class="font10"> design to that taught by the Egyptians and Babylonians, L a v a r d ’ s archaeological discoveries show that the Babylonians used an equilateral triangle to symbolize their “trinity”. Likewise the Egyptians used the triangle for the same purpose. (Maurice’s </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Indian Antiquities, vol.</span><span class="font10"> Iv, p. 445) Hence Christendom’s employment of three-sided and three-cornered objects to represent her “Christianized” three-headed “trinity” also finds its origin in the religions of the heathen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Concerning the sciences of arithmetic and astronomy, the historian Zonaras of the twelfth century says what all historians know to be true: “these came from the Chaldees to the Egyptians, and thence to the Greeks.” Therefore Alexander Hislop in his monumental work </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Two Babylons</span><span class="font10"> reasons: “If the Egyptians and Greeks derived their arithmetic and astronomy from Chaldea, seeing these in Chaldea were -sacred sciences, and monopolized by the priests, that is sufficient evidence that they must have derived their religion from the same quarter.” The research work of both Bunsen and Layard substantially proves the same thing. Samuel Birch, the eminent authority on Assyrian and Egyptian antiquities, speaking of the inscriptions on Babylonian cylinders, says: “The zodiacal signs . . . show unequivocally that the Greeks derived their notions and arrangements of the zodiac [and hence the religious mythology connected with it] from the Chaldees. The identity of Nimrod with the constellation Orion is not to be rejected.” All of this led to a universal practice of demon religion having a basic similarity by the time the Roman empire came to power, concerning which the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Americana</span><span class="font10"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Fundamentally the primitive religious ideas of all the Indo-European peoples were quite similar. Even the Roman religion, in the days when Rome was governed by kings and had already begun to evolve complicated rituals and complex myths, still retained a suggestive similarity to that of India. . . . Babylonian, Greek, Assyrian, Egyptian and Eastern religious ideas found welcome in Rome. The- Great Earth Mother of, Asia Minor [therefore of Babylon] and Isis, the mother goddess of Egypt, were not only introduced into Rome but their worship, which was accompanied with elaborate ritual and ceremonial, became almost universal throughout the Roman Empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And so it was, when Constantine set up a supposedly universal state religion called Catholicism, he was able to lure the pagans into it by adopting their heathen doctrine of the “trinity”. One only has to look at the I.H.S. on the wafers used in celebrating the mass to see a glaring example of Constantine’s technique. Today we are told that the letters stand for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">lesus Hominum Salvator,</span><span class="font10"> meaning “Jesus the Savior of men”. But actually they represent the names of the ancient Egyptian trinity, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Isis, Horus, Seb,</span><span class="font10"> that is, “the Mother, the Child, and the Father of the gods”. This was a skillfully planned scheme of double-sense meaning used to retain the pagan support, while at the same time appearing on the surface to be Christian. Just more of the papal double-talk so rampant now in the political muddle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Heathen Trinitarians of the East</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What could be stronger proof that the “trinity” idea had a common origin in paganism than the fact that heathens of India, Burma, China and Japan all worship a triune god? The Hindu has his trimurti or triad consisting of Brahma (the Creator), Vishnu (the Preserver), and Siva (the Destroyer). In one of India’s most ancient Hindu cave temples at Elephanta a representation of this pagan trinity was found having upon it the inscription, “One God, three forms.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Taoism is one of the many devil-religions of China, and it consists mainly of a modification of the ancient Chinese demon-worship of Nimrod, with borrowings from Buddhism, which is another type of demon-worship. Taoists take their name from the teachings of a southern Chinese philosopher, Lao-tse. They have their monks and priests who bewitch them with all manner of superstitions, and cause them to worship and believe in a “trinity” with Lao-tse holding the second place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Mahayana Buddhists have their trinity god also, a triple-bodied Buddha that they call </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Trikaya.</span><span class="font10"> In Japan the very same form of three-headed god found in the West is worshiped under the name of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">San Pao. Fuh.</span><span class="font10"> All of these forms of the “trinity” are not new creations brought forth since the birth of Catholicism, but, rather, are of a very ancient origin. Says Hjslop, who was a trinitarian himself: “The recognition of a trinity was universal in all the ancient nations of the world/’Heathendom did not get it from Christendom, but vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Tracing the abominable doctrine of the “trinity” back to its origin, and after uncovering the bare facts, it is seen that the ancient worshipers of the Devil who gave themselves over to obscene sex or phallic worship were the first to believe in a triune god. rnose lewd creatures set up their “trinity” around the producer, the producing and the produced, and the deities representing the father, the mother and the child. (See McClintock &amp;&nbsp;Strong, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Cyclopedia,</span><span class="font10"> vol. 10, p. 556.) The “trinity” symbols they used, and which have been found, and which resemble the symbols used today<sup>7</sup> by Christendom, were originally’intended to represent the reproductive organs of the male.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Only Satan the Devil could be the author of so repulsive and blasphemous a doctrine, his purpose being to deny Jehovah God’s supremacy by making two others equal to Him. Little wonder then, that, having so firmly<sup>7</sup> saddled this loathsome and hateful doctrine upon the majority of Christendom as well as on most of heathendom, the Devil does everything in his power to prevent the people from learning that the “trinity” teaching is a monstrous lie. So for you, the honest reader, there is published in this issue </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">on page twenty-four</span><span class="font10"> the Bible proof that Christendom’s three-headed god is a fake. Jesus denies the “trinity”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The abdication of King Michael of Rumania on December 30 might have been expected, though it did come as a surprise.

<p><span class="font7">&lt;§&gt; Along with interim aid for three European countries and China, Congress in its extra, session considered the threat of inflation at home.

No pardon^ were rec-ommendetf for those Who didJuet earn theft Jiving from their ministry. Also many full-time ministers of Jehovah’s witnesses, known as pioneers, were denied pardon. Since not all such full-time and part-time ministers were pardoned, it is obvious that many were discriminated against</span></p>

A discovery had been made that the substance which enables plants to synthesize edible products out of carbon dioxide and water is chlorophyll, the green coloring matter in plants. As yet only a clue of the process is known, but the discovery of the key substance may, it is believed, open up the way to production of synthetic foods. But mankind, will doubtless prefer nature's method to man’s efforts at copying It.</span></p>
