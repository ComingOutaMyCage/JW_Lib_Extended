</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">TIIE first ten amendments to the American Constitution are known as the Bill of Rights. They have been the center of much controversy, both in and out .of court, and through it all they have proved their worth as a guarantee, of certain individual liberties. This article endeavors to show this proof of worthiness, particularly in the case of the First Amendment to the Constitution, appearing in the Bill of Rights, It guarantees such broad and vital freedoms as speech and press and worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The American Constitution establishes legislative, executive and judicial branches of government, and outlines the powers of each, A balance of power is set up, a sphere of activity for each is marked- out, and the court is thft arbiter of the boundary lines between the three branches. In addition, a certain' area of activity is reserved to the individual citizen, and, again, it is the courts that determine the line between the rights of the individual and the authority of the legislature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Herein the American system differs from the English principle of a sovereign legislature unrestrained by any human power. The traditional British view is that the legislature should be free and unfettered to act. But how can persons injured by ill-considered legislation gain legal relief? The British system declares </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">NOVEMBER 8, 1948</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">that the appeal must be to those wh ' elected the legislators, that is, the people. Such a remedy would be through a long and drawn-out political process of electioneering, and even then success would be problematical. What chance would a suffering minority have at the polls, where, the majority rules?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">How different it is where a written Bill of Rights guarantees individual liberties! In the United States the federal and state legislatures may enact laws, but if those laws trespass on civil liberties of the individual citizen he can appeal to the courts and cause such unconstitutional laws to be declared invalid. This extraordinary power of the American ‘judiciary has made the federal Constitution, and especially the Bill of Rights, a dynamic instrument in the hands of the people. By invoking through the courts _the guarantees of the Constitution an American citizen is in the unusual position of being able to fight for his personal liberties against the legislative and executive branches of government themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Opponents of a written Bill of Rights contend that it leaves the American government in a legal strait jacket., Can it truthfully be said that the social and economic and political growth and prog-, ress of the United States has been retarded by the Bill of Rights ? Has the right of the people to enter courts and fight for their freedoms, even against the government, impaired'the efficiency of the state? To the contrary! The United States, though far from perfect, provides a measure of personal liberty unsurpassed by any other nation. Remarkable strides made by the nation industrially and scientifically bespeak a healthy national life. Dictatorial rulers may deride as impotent a government that cannot (as they often do) deprive the people of their liberties. Totalitarians consider freedoms to be impractical luxuries, but the philosophy of fairness and equality before the law that is inherent in the Constitution of the United States has contributed to the nation’s growth to high stature among the world powers. The government is confined in no harmful legal strait jacket by the Bill of Rights, and that written bill prevents the government from slapping any strait jackets on its citizens.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Constitutional Guarantees in Theory</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">Since this article is specializing on the broad, basic freedoms of speech and press and worship and assembly, it quotes only those portions of the Constitution guaranteeing them. Outstanding is the First Amendment, which is Article I of the Bill of Eights, and reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a* redress of grievances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This amendment limited the powers of Congress only. But a further amendment, adopted following the Civil War, made applicable to the states the same limitations placed upon the federal government, particularly those relating to civil ’liberties. This additional amendment was the Fourteenth, and says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It was the purpose of the Constitution to provide a restraint against extreme measures at any time. Even during the troubled times of the Civil War the Supreme Court held to this principle. Mr. Justice Davis, speaking for the court, refused to countenance the specious argument that constitutional guarantees could be shelved in time of emergency. He said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all circumstances. No doctrine, involving more pernicious consequences, was ever invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Thomas Jefferson held that it was time enough for government to interfere when principles broke out into overt acts against peace and order, and that truth left to itself will prevail, that it is a sufficient antagonist of error. Mr. Justice Brandeis expressed belief in the practical value of free speech, declaring its exercise was more important to the nation than to the individual and that “in frank expression of conflicting opinion lies the greatest promise pf wisdom in governmental action; and in suppression lies ordinarily the greatest peril”. Such liberal thinkers envisioned liberty of expression in the fullest possible extent. If the ideas expressed are wrong, their impact on the public mind may be corrected by reply from those of contrary views. Discussion and controversy stir up thought and bring more minds, more ideas, more viewpoints to bear on the issue. None may be entirely correct, but by the balancing influence of all shades of opinion, wisdom is most apt to be reached. It is from suppression, not expression, that violence flows.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>&quot;Clear and Present Danger*</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">Following World War I thdre was a period when members of the Supreme Court entertained divergent opinions as to what speech was permissible and what was not. One school of thought followed the common-law rule that words were punishable if they were considered to have a “reasonable tendency”, no matter how remote, to cause evils forbidden by law. What was forbidden was couched in such vague and indefinite language that the law was in reality a dragnet which could enmesh any ideas that were at the moment in popular disfavor. The opposing line of thought as to what speech was permissible was first adopted by Justices Holmes and Brandeis. Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for the court, laid down the test in a decision rendered in 1919, saying: <sup>H</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">clear and present danger</span><span class="font10"> that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On this view of the law, speech is permissible unless there is a clear (that is, apparent, obvious, real) danger that the speech or writing will cause unlawful action and that the action will be taken immediately or in a short time. This test is more definite and enables the jury or court to reach a conclusion on the evidence and not on pure speculation. If laws are passed that prohibit the spread of certain ideas, the Supreme Court can examine the statute in the light of the “clear and present danger” test If there is no immediate or real danger that the words will interfere with the operation of some valid law, then the attempted legislative restriction on speech is void. Or, if the law itself is constitutional,, the court can still consider the behavior or speech specifically questioned under it. If the words are unlikely to cause any early outbreak of lawlessness, the conviction will be set aside even though the law itself is valid. Thus the court looks not only at the law, but at what is called in question by the law, so that individual liberties cannot be denied on the pretext that there is nothing wrong with the statute </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">per se.</span><span class="font12"> This sound approach was further expounded in 1927, in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Whitney </span><span class="font12">v. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">California,</span><span class="font12"> Mr. Justice Brandeis said, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The fact that speech is likely to result in some violence or in destruction of property is not enough to justify its suppression. There must be the probability of serious injury to the State. Among free men, the deterrents ordinarily to be applied to prevent crime are education and punishment for violations of the law, not abridgment of the rights of free speech and assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In 1931 the Supreme Court invalidated a state statute that allowed courts to issue injunction to restrain as a public nuisance “malicious, scandalous, and defamatory^ newspapers, magazines and other periodicals. The majority opinion, written by Chief Justice Hughes, struck down this form of press censorship and pointed out the right course for victims of libelous journalism:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Public officers, whose character and conduct remain open to debate and free discussion in the press, find their remedies for false accusations in actions under libel laws providing for redress and punishment, and not in proceedings to restrain the publication of newspapers and periodicals.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Freedom to Disseminate Opinion</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">The foregoing has considered chiefly </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">what</span><span class="font12"> may be said. But for free speech and press to be of practical effect the words, whether spoken dr written, must reach an audience. Hence any law that discriminates against or interferes with dissemination of information is invalid. Freedom of press carries with it the right to distribute what has been printed. This position has been bulwarked by many Supreme Court decisions, the ma^ jority of them having been fought by Jehovah's witnesses. Since 1938 they have had before that court over rorty cases (37 won, 7 lost, including draft cases) involving free speech and press and worship. The first was </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">'Lovell</span><span class="font12"> v. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">City of Griffin,</span><span class="font12"> The city forbade the distribution of literature without a permit from the city manager. The court ruled that such an ordinance would restore “censorship in its baldest form”, and added: &quot;Liberty of circulating is as essential to that freedom as liberty of publishing; indeed, without the circulation, the publication would be of little value.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Nor can dissemination of opinion be choked off on the grounds that the message may be objectionable and cause a breach of peace. In </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Cantwell</span><span class="font12"> v. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Connecticut</span><span class="font12"> Mr. Justice Roberts said for the court:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font10">the realm of religious faith, and in that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">political belief, sharp differences arise. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font10">both fields the tenets of one man may seem the rankest error to his neighbor. To persuade others to his own point of view, the pleader, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">as we </span><span class="font10">know, at times, resorts to exaggeration, to vilification of men who have been, or are, prominent in church or state, and even to false statement. But the people of this nation have ordained in the light of history, that, in spite of the probability of excesses and abuses, these liberties are, in the long view, essential to enlightened opinion and right conduct on the part of the citizens of a democracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It was stated by Chief Justice Marshall early in American history that “the power to tax is the power to destroy”. Yet towns in Alabama, Arizona and Arkansas had laws requiring payment of a license tax by vendors. That in itself was all right, but when the law was applied to the distribution of literature containing opinion it infringed on freedom of speech and press. Because contributions were accepted for Bible literature, the towns classed the activity commercial. In 1942 the Supreme Court upheld the towns, but in 1943, on rehearing, the court reversed itself and declared the' convictions invalid. As applied to the work of Jehovah’s witnesses, the ordinances ininngea on oasic rreeaoms. The court’s position v^as clearly stated in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Murdock</span><span class="font12"> v. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Pennsylvania</span><span class="font12"> case, involving the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. The court’s opinion, delivered by Justice Douglas, stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The hand distribution of religious tracts is an age-old form of missionary evangelism—as old as-the history of printing presses. It has been a potent force in various religious movements down through the years. This form of evangelism is utilized today on a large scale by various religious sects whose colporteurs carry the gospel to thousands upon thousands of homes and seek through personal visitations to win adherents to their faith. It is more than preaching; it is more than distribution of religious literature. It is a combination of both. Its purpose is as evangelical as the revival meeting. This form of religious activity occupies the same high estate under the First Amendment as do worship in the churches and preaching from the pulpits. It has the same claim to protection as the more orthodox and conventional exercises of religion. It also has the same claim as the others to the guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of the press. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The mere fact that the religious literature is &quot;sold” by itinerant preachers rather than &quot;donated” does not transform evangelism into a commercial, efiterprise. If it did, then the passing of a collection plate in church would make the church service a commercial project. . . . Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion are available to all, not merely to those who can pay their own way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Freedom to spread opinion overcomes such barriers as company-owned towns, through the provisions of the written Bill of Rights. For instance, a company-owned town in Alabama decided to prohibit Jehovah’s witnesses liberty to circulate their message there. The same controversy arose in the case of a housing project in Texas that was owned by the federal government. Such was tantamount to saying these towns were no part of the democratic nation, but separate communities where constitutional guarantees of freedom were inoperative. But in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Marsh</span><span class="font12"> v. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Alabama</span><span class="font12"> (1946) the Supreme Court, speaking through Justice Black, disagreed with this restrictive view and ruled concerning the inhabitants of such towns that “their information must be uncensored”, that “there is no more reason for depriving these people of the liberties guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments than there is for curtailing these freedoms with respect to any other citizen”. Thus the Bill of Rights, interpreted and enforced through the courts, proves its dynamic vitality by penetrating every corner of the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Most recent in the array of cases involving Jehovah’s witnesses to reach the Supreme Court was one raising the right to be heard by use of sound equipment. On June 7, 1948, in a 5-4 decision, the high court ruled in favor of the Witnesses and upheld their right to preach in public parks and use amplifiers in order to be heard. It said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Noise can be regulated by regulating decibels. The hours and place of public discussion can be controlled. But to allow the. police to bar the use of loudspeakers because their use can be abused is like barring radio receivers because they too make a noise. . . . When a city allows an official to ban them in his uncontrolled discretion, it sanctions a device for suppression of free communication of ideas. . . .

<p><span class="font12">The most vital, the most cherished freedom is the liberty to worship according to the dictates of one’s own conscience, and not according to the conscience or dictates of someone else. Ofttimes freedom to worship has revolved around freedom to refrain from performing certain acts, rather than liberty to do specific things. So it has often been relative to ceremonies. Outstanding in the United States in recent years have been Supreme Court decisions concerning attempts to force school children to salute the flag. The flag is a symbol or imdge, containing stars on a field of blue and stripes of red and white. Oftentimes the image of an eagle perches atop the staff. Stars, colors, eagle, all are symbolical. But inasmuch as Exodus 20:3-5 forbids reverential attitudes toward images, Jehovah’s witnesses do not salute the flag of any nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">And to those who brush aside such objection on the ground that the flag-salute ceremony involves no worshipful attitudes we offer, the reminder that the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Americana,</span><span class="font12"> page 316, speaks of it as reverence and says: “The flag, like the cross, is sacred.” Jehovah’s witnesses reserve their reverence for God and refuse to attribute salvation to the flag by saluting it. Others may do so with clear conscience, but this Christian group, feels differently. This ddes not make them disloyal, since there is no valid law requiring it, and since they are law-abiding and respect the principles for which the flag stands. Moreover, the Bill of Rights guarantees freedom of worship according to one’s conscience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Hence when school boards throughout the country required students to salute the flag and youthful Jehovah’s witnesses refused and were expelled, the issue came before the Supreme Court. In 1940, by a majority of 8 to 1, the court upheld forced salutes. This decision precipitated wholesale expulsion of children from school and gave excuse for mob action throughout the nation. But on June 14, 1943, Flag Day, the Supreme Court reversed itself by a 6-to-3 vote. Oh this matter Justice Jackson, speaking for the court, said in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Barnette</span><span class="font12"> v. Ivesf </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Virginia Board of Education</span><span class="font12"> case-:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The refusal of these persons to participate in the ceremony does not interfere with or deny rights of others to do so. Nor is there any question in this case that their behavior is peaceable and orderly. ... To sustain the compulsory flag salute we are required to say that a Bill of Bights which guards the individual's right to speak his own mind, left it open to public authorities to compel him to utter what is not in his mind. , . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Struggles to coerce uniformity of sentiment in support of some end thought essential to their .time and country have been waged by many good as well as by evil men. . . , Ultimate futility of such attempts to compel coherence is the lesson of every such effort from the Roman drive to stamp out Christianity as a disturber of its pagan unity<sub>}</sub> the Inquisition, as a means to religious and dynastic unity, the Siberian exiles as a means to Russian unity, down to the fast failing efforts of our present totalitarian enemies. Those who begin coercive elimination of dissent soon find themselves exterminating dissenters. Compulsory unification of opinion achieves only the unanimity of tiie graveyard- . . -</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall he orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein. If there are any circumstances which permit an exception, they do not now occur to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We think the action of the local authorities in compelling the flag salute and pledge transcends constitutional limitations on their power and invades the sphere of intellect and spirit which it is the purpose of the First Amendment to our Constitution to reserve from all official control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Also noteworthy in the field of freedom of worship were decisions rendered by the Supreme Court in three sedition cases brought against Jehovah’s witnesses. The three cases are cited as </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Taylor</span><span class="font12"> v* </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Mississippi,</span><span class="font12"> and decisions came on the same day as the favorable flag-salute decision. The basis of the conviction of the Witnesses in the lower courts was that the message they distributed about God's kingdom as being the only hope of the world would likely result in dissatisfaction against the war effort and the peace and dignity of the state. But the Supreme Court disagreed, holding that announcing (rod's kingdom as the hope of the world was not sedition, and the prison sentences of ten years imposed against the defendants were set aside and the prosecutions ordered dismissed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Eternal Vigilance Still Price of Liberty</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Mr. Justice Murphy, consistently the outstanding champion of civil liberties on the high federal bench, warned the American people in his powerful dissent in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Prince</span><span class="font12"> v. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Massachusetts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">No chapter</span><span class="font10"> in human history has been so largely written in terms of persecution and intolerance as the one dealing with religious freedom. From ancient times to the present day, the ingenuity of man has known no limits in its ability to forge weapons of oppression for use against those who dare to express or practice unorthodox religious beliefs. And the Jehovah’s witnesses are living proof of the fact that even in this nation, conceived as it was in the ideals of freedom, the right to practice religion in unconventional ways is still far from secure. Theirs is a militant and unpopular faith, pursued with a fanatical zeal. They have suffered brutal beatings; their property has been destroyed; they have been harassed at every turn by the resurrection </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">and enforcement of little used</span><span class="font10"> ordinances and statutes. See Mulder and Comisky, *Jehovah’s witnesses Mold Constitutional Law/ 2 Bill of Rights Review, No, 4, p. 262. To them, along with other present -day religious minoiities, befalls the burden of testing our devotion to the ideals and constitutional guarantees of religious freedom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">UNITED STATES BLUNDERS IN BERLIN</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">An Inside Story</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">R</span><span class="font12">AUCOUS blasts of propaganda have clubbed Americans to sleep on the facts of the explosive Berlin Crisis. Now a sober word picture has been painted that should have a wakening effect. Its calm presentation of facts argues for its truthfulness, just as the frantic emotionalism and sweeping condemnations of the general news dispatches make them suspect of unscrupulous and reckless distortion. The uncolored picture in black and white was sketched by Thomas F. Hawkins, regional editor in Germany for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">U.S, News World Report,</span><span class="font12"> when he recently returned to the United States for a vacation. By permission we reprint the bulk of his report, as it appeared in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">U.S. News & World Report, </span><span class="font12">September 10, an independent weekly magazine on national and international affairs, published in Washington, copyright 1948 United States News Publishing Corporation. The report follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Perhaps we shall know how to occupy Germany after another war. We certainly have made a mess of it this time ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">That remark was made by a friend in U.S. Military Government, economic side, with whom I spent a half hour shortly before leaving Frankfurt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I fully .agree with him. I went to Germany in April, 1946—after watching the country during the war from the side lines in Switzerland—with considerable optimism. I expected to see the reconstruction of a defeated nation, and, in the process, development of mutual understanding and co-operation with Russia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But we have not yet got Germany on a sound road to reconstruction. We have not yet conclusively won Germans to our side. Our relations with Russia are worse than ever. We must accept a good share of the blame, for failure to follow through with a firm, clear and practicable policy. Talks in Moscow may gain us time to develop such a policy, but I fear not more than a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We came into Berlin with Russian permission, having failed to use the opportunity to capture it first. As in the similar easest of Prague and Vienna, this east us considerable standing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Worse, we came with an attitude of self-importance, and, with the debatable exception of Gen. Lucius D. Clay, with inadequate negotiators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Why &quot;We Feed Berliners</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The story is told that, upon arrival, we staked out signs marking the U. S. sector in Berlin. The Russians took them down and said: &quot;Yes, they can go back up when it's decided who's going to feed Germans in the sector.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We thus were maneuvered into a responsibility not foreseen. It is this obligation that required the “air lift” and that has been the barrier to graceful renunciation of responsibility for the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There also is the story of a dispute with a Russian detachment billeted in our sector shortly after we entered Berlin. The Russians wouldn't leave. An impetuous American colonel had a tank rolled up to the building to chase them out. He had to be called off by a superior officer, and Russian withdrawal then was arranged by negotiation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I can't vouch for these two yarns, since I wasn't present. But' I'm quite convinced they are true. The latter story, at least, is illustrative of methods we have used. They can, at best, be called straightforward but not diplomatic,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Maj. Gen. Ray W_ Barker was one Berlin Governor who appeared to be getting somewhere with the Russians—until a spinal injury from a jeep accident forced him home at the end of April, 1946. He felt there was a great danger from Russian Communism that must be fought. But he—almost alone among the military—also was convinced that firm, frank dealing could bring a working arrangement satisfactory to both East and West. He had, I think, the respect of the Russians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">General Barker did not rush into fiery public statements when a dispute with the Russians arose. Instead, he solved many serious problems .by getting in his car and going directly to the Russians. He was not misled by arrests or fights .involving Russian and American soldiers; he knew fault could be on both sidesi Far too many cases of Americans arrested have been blown up as important incidents when they involved merely a drunken soldier, a soldier going to see a girl in the Russian sector, or an American on a black-market foray. Americans often have gone to the Russian sector, too, because they found it easier to buy liquor in German cafes, away from American MP’s,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Beating of a uniformed Polish correspondent and a woman companion by GPs in the American sector is among events I know of that have not boon generally publicized. And nobody writes about American drunks who knock on the door at 2 a.m. to ask if a German girl lives there. This isn’t very frequent, but it has occurred at my Berlin home*</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The point is that an incident was news only if the Russians were involved, and the presumption almost always was—often erroneously—that the Russians were to blame. And, too often, these incidents should have been merely matters of record on the police blotter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One of the bigger blunders occurred over seating of a city-government official. The Russians wanted to seat a certain fellow and we didn't. The American representative, little versed in politics, erroneously cast his vote with the Russians. State Department assistants had told him what to do before the meeting; he simply got his directions mixed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Disagreements With Russians</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We knew pretty well last January that the Russians might walk out of the Berlin Control Council, after breakdown of the four-power conference in London. Currency reform and the unity of Germany were the real issues. We had failed at London to present a concrete program for the unification of Germany, and I have the feeling we went to that meeting convinced that it wouldn't work. We didn't want unity then, and seemed determined to push ahead with a West </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Germany. </span><span class="font10">We thus were vulnerable. Somehow we had gained the idea that we could tell off the Russians. They surely were aware of this, and I think we greatly underestimated thenx</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We could have presented at London a carefully drawn plan for unification of Germany, taking the chance we ultimately must take anyway, that Germany may si verve to the Communist side. We could have been ready to argue that plan, to compromise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We could have accepted a single currency reform, taking the gamble that the Russians might print too much money for stability. It is still debatable whether we can make the Western currency reform work in the long run, anyway. Going along with a unified reform, despite risks, would have eased the crisis, given a bit of time. These things we did not do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then, when the Russians proposed at the Berlin Control Council that general questions of the London conference be discussed, General Clay and his Western colleagues said those questions were outside their province. The Russian chairman thereupon promptly adjourned the council.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">General Clay, with the British and French, might have offset this by saying that, while the matters were not within their jurisdiction, they would be happy to discuss, and pass on results to the proper authority. There then would have been no excuse for the Russians to walk out of that meeting, at </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">least.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As chairman of the Control Council for the subsequent month, General Clay issued no meeting call. Had he done so and the Russians then refused to attend, ire </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">would</span><span class="font10"> hare had a far clearer case for proving that it was the Russians, and not ourselves, who broke down four-power rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Stoppage of trains into Berlin also leaves</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">us in a somewhat doubtful position. The Rus</span><span class="font10">sians were irritated, first, when commercial air lines began to carry German passengers </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">over whom </span><span class="font10">the Russians had no control. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font10">did insist, however, that these Germans have interzonal passes, required under a four-power agreement. The Russians had honored these passes by train and car. In violation of the agreement, however, at lepst the British were using their train to send Germans to the Western zones without the interzonal pass. I don’t think it ever was published, but the British have acknowledged it. Some of the cases involved merely the convenient sending of a secretary to the zone for a holiday—with British military orders, but no interzonal pass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Troubles Of Air Supply</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The pass requirement may sound unreasonable and silly, since a German should be able to travel at will within Germany. But the failure to issue passes did violate four-power understanding, and gave the Russians an excuse, first to stop and search trains, then to halt them altogether. We could have—and probably without loss of prestige—quickly agreed </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">the Russian offer to reinstate the trains if a Russian inspection were permitted. That inspection was permitted from the very beginning for auto transport. We could have used the train request to suggest a four-power MP setup—with a Russian, an Ameri-can, a British and a French MP as a team. This would be similar to the four-power military-guard system, still in force at the Control Council headquarters in Berlin. If further trouble then arose, we again would have had a better case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Instead, General Clay said he would fly in everything that was required and wodld use fighter cover if necessary. It was fortunate that fighter cover was not then necessary. We had only about 200 fighters available quickly, each roughly equivalent to the Russian Yak in ability. But, in the corridor alone, I would judge the Russians keep at least 400 Yaks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Army Secretary Kenneth C. Royall’s statement from Washington was no help, either. His suggestion that General Clay had the authority to shoot if he thought it necessary was dangerous bravado. We were afraid jn Berlin, at one time, that the verbal blasts in Washington would be followed by a real blast that could set off a war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All during this period our lack of statesmanship in Berlin became sharply apparent. At one four-power meeting, the Russian representative delivered a two-hour tirade, charging us with violating four-power agreements and not meeting food requirements. The British replied formally. The U. S. representative felt it necessary to tell the Russian officer he “had never heard such a pack of lies since the days of Ananias.” This may well have been true, but the statement was given gleefully to the press, made the front pages, irritated the Russians, and did no one any good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There was also the case of the Russian </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">who </span><span class="font10">accused Americans of “biting” an elderly German woman. The U, S. reply was that American soldiers didn’t bite but Russians frequently did when fighting. That, too, hit front pages. Truth was that the U. S, translator erred. The Russians, discussing assault, hadn’t said “bite<sup>71</sup> at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We have been operating an expensive </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">air </span><span class="font10">lift to supply Berlin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Argument is that it gave us time to wait, <sub>(</sub> to negotiate in Moscow. One can argue also that the Russians are letting the air lift run itself out. They could stop it in a minute, at the risk of war. But they probably are convinced they need only wait—that supplying sufficient food and coal to West Berliners by air throughout the winter will be a hazardous and, in the long run, a probably unsuccessful venture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">^Penny-Wise’ Education</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We have failed in Germany to establish anything approaching democracy. There are constitutions along democratic lines, but no feeling for democracy. It was not to have been expected from a still-nationalistic people. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Our </span><span class="font10">educational budget for the U. S, zone is something less than 1 per cent of the total outlay. We have refused to put up the money for good textbooks because the Germans “have </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font10">money to pay.” Instead we have been using, in the basically vital task of rehabilitation, books that in many cases are of Nazi origin— with paper pasted over unacceptable passages. Only the French have gone at this sensibly, with good, new books and a carefully planned educational program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We virtually are forcing the .Germans into a Western government. The Germans themselves don’t want it, partly out of fear of Russia, partly because Germans think they can wangle a unified nation more easily if there is no Western government now, and partly because they don’t like us much more .than they like the Russians. As General Clay has said, they perhaps “hate us least" of the occupants. Even so, there is a strong feeling among Germans that a German deal with Russia must, can. and will be made. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The sort of thing that hampers our effort to instill democracy by military occupation was sharply demonstrated in Munich in April, 1946, during an interview by visiting U. S. editors with German members of the Bavarian government. Seated at a long conference table, the American guests had cake and coffee, after which the Germans were shown in. We talked until noon. Then the Germans marched out, to lunch in an Army mess hall. The Americans went on to a swank club for cocktails and an excellent lunch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Yet those Germans were our collaborators in seeking a democracy. Several had been in concentration camps under Hitler. At least one had dangerously co-operated with American intelligence during the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Russians never made such an error. Those they paraded for company they also entertained with the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Except for the top men, our denazification program simmers down to statistics on people who filed questionnaires, were punished, released or cleared. We accomplished only chaos, and a hard Nazi core still exists. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One long-standing trouble in our dealings with the Russians in Germany is a mental attitude that we are going to have to fight them. That feeling shows up in the military, at alb levels. It may be a true forecast, but the attitude of preparing to fight is a big handicap in working out the problems of peace. . . ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The military setup in Germany has cost us a lot of seasoned State Department help. Ambassador Robert D. Murphy, as General Clay’s assistant, has kept affably in the background of the Army operation. But his staff has been bitter at being forced to sit on the side lines, unable to step in on many occasions when it thought it should.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">General Clay gets credit for stopping the switch from Army to State Department administration, although the tension with Russia made it easy to argue necessity for keeping the military control. Military brass also is considered responsible for sidetracking the constabulary—originally set up as a policing force, a small emergency band to permit withdrawal of the Army. It would have been the protective unit in the interim between full occupation and no occupation. But its job now is mostly that of supplying traffic cops, its future uncertain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Motives of Germans</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All in all, we have flopped in most postwar diplomatic tussles with Russia over Germany We have failed to win Germany, can’t count upon Germans as potential democrats or Western allies. They will serve with what they consider their best interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Germans support us now because: (1) they think we will win; (2) they adhere to the anti-Russian Goebbels theme; (3) they personally are getting more benefits from us, and (4) a few are sincerely supporters of the Western democratic world. Most want to stay on the side lines, work with whoevef is at hand for profit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We have never given proper sympathy and understanding to the French,'a really democratic hation. We have alienated the British on occasion. We are looked upon skeptically by the Scandinavians, the Swiss and the people of the Low Countries—much as they like </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">US.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Unless the Moscow conference is the beginning of a change, we are headed in the direction of war with Russia which could mean ten years of fighting, followed by a ruined European world and chaos at home. That is the feeling in Germany.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Foreknowing man’s shallow tendency to set up superficial standards Jehovah announced His rule in the selection of King David.

<p><span class="font12">“Behold the beauty of Jehovah !” Banish with these words the myth that beauty, brilliance and righteousness are never found in combination. (Psalm 27:4) Not that good looks or the lack thereof decides our destiny. It is simply a gift that the eye of man is attuned to enjoy, just as he delights in a burnished sunset, the billowing spray of a white waterfall splashing down a green valley, or the heavenly splendor of our earthly glimpse of the universe. Handsome men and beautiful women should be grateful for this special blessing’and not fall into the error of unbecoming conduct. “As </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">ring of gold in the snout of a swine, is a woman of beauty who hath abandoned discretion.” (Proverbs 11:22, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.;</span><span class="font12"> or “a pretty woman without sense”, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt)</span><span class="font12"> It goes without saying that physical beauty has, anciently as well as recently, been used to ensnare, Lucifer being the first to turn his beauty into vice. Leafing through the pages of the Bible we find that Saul, Absalom and Solomon failed to live up to their noble appearance. All of these examples prove that the heart, not the face, even as Jehovah emphasized, is the determining factor.</span></p>

Concerning this practice the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Americana</span><span class="font12"> reveals:.“Chiromancy or palmistry deals with the ‘seven mounts’ of the hand,<sup>-</sup> their lines, and the interlacings of the latter.

Rosenstein’s findings condensed in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Science Digest</span><span class="font12"> dismiss as foolish the claims of hand-reading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Among other claims of the chirognomists are that the difference in length between the little finger and second finger is related to ambition; that the longer the fingers in proportion to the length of the palm the more impulsive the person is; that long, tapering fingers are a sign of artistic ability; that a flat spatulate thumb indicates uncontrollable and even murderous tendencies. These have all been studied and found to have no validity. . . . There is no relationship between the distance a person can bend his fingers backward and “keenness of mind”. [Science </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Digest,</span><span class="font10"> February, 1945, “Fallacies in Judging Character”]</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">He further concludes that a study of handwriting proves nothing more than that different people write differently. In view of these sweeping conclusions the amount of serious space devoted by leading periodicals to graphology and palmistry is amazing. Periodicals well know how anxious their readers are to pigeonhole their fellow men, so dare not overlook any bets,' even spurious ones. Generally commenting upon some of these misconceptions Rosenstein adds:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A high brow does not always indicate intelligence. A fishy eye does not indicate dishonesty; nor do long, tapering fingers indicate artistic temperament. Red-headed people are not all hot-tempered, nor is a colorless personality indicated by pale skin, sandy hair, and a flabby handshake. Not all fat people are good-natured and easy going, and,thin people are not necessarily critical and analytical. . . . Graphology is another interesting fake with no validity beyond proving that different people write differently.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Phrenology Foolishness</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">Phrenology has long been given serious consideration by laymen and scientists alike. A short, sloping forehead indicated barbaric, primitive motivation. Bumps, protuberances, depressions of the cranium, each were assigned their specific characteristic, and the whole head was mapped into areas controlling the emotions of love, hate, parental affection, combativeness, destructiveness, self-esteem, hope, wonder, ideality, as well as faculties relating to size, time, tune, form and weight. (TFebster&gt;) Many sensible people have thus suffered the misapprehension for a lifetime that their head conformation was responsible for what they are. If they were not loving, if they hated excessively, the lack of a certain bump or the enlargement thereof was to blame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The relation of head proportions to what we are is zero. Authors Cleeton and Knight, writing on the. “Validity of Character Judgments”, conclude: “Statistically the correlation between variations in physical traits and character traits is 0.000 (within the reliability of our data).” Further as for a certain portion of the cranium as being the seat of a certain emotion or motive it has been shown that as far as is known the brain does not work that way, and just how this exquisite thinking mechanism does operate is practically unknown. Brain operations for cutting out hates, fears, worries, are recommended only for statesmen who are trying to stir up war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Another pet theory that goes down the drain upon investigation is that the temperament and qualities of an individual depend upon his nationality or national origin. In his publication </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Human Nature and Management,</span><span class="font12"> Ordway Tead says on this point:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As to the different personal and working traits which different racial groups will bring to a job, there is little of a truly scientific nature that can be stated here. There is a great deal of popular attribution of thoroughness to Germans, stolidity to Poles, excitability to Italians, and similar generalities; but the interviewer [for selecting employees] who was governed by these notions would certainly go wrong. The fact is that we do not know in any accurate way how much the racial factors count in creating personal differences. [P. 201]</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">About all the value of photographs is for partial identification and estimating facial good looks. The researches of Psychologist McCabe that </span><span class="font10">hundreds of informal experiments conducted in classes of elementary’ psychology, involving many thousands of college students, have shown that the students could not, just from examining photographs of heads and faces, recognize the criminal, the salesman, the clergyman, the executive, the brilliant, the feeble-minded, the mechanic, or the teacher,, and distinguish one from another. As a matter of fact, equally good judgment might have resulted from tossing a coin or making selections while blindfolded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Sheldon, another authority, concludes, after extensive experiment, “No relation could be found between intelligence and head and face measurements.” If, however, you are still skeptical, go to the prisons and mental institutions. There you will find every type of face and head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Perhaps it is dangerous, before concluding the argument, to venture upon the subject of vital male interest and controversy, namely, the merits and demerits of blondes, brunettes and redheads, female of the species. Please be' assured that from the following comments no dispute should be inferred concerning your personal taste or ’preferences. The only question considered is whether the color of the lady's hair in-_ variably indicates specific traits and qualities that may guide your selection. Unfortunately for man’s quest for information on the enigmatical sex, the color of her hair will offer no reliable clue. Despite the claims by Katherine Blackford, who achieved some fame by asserting that certain definite behavior could be ascribed to blonde or to brunette, the results of experiments prove that any combination of desirable or undesirable qualities can be found lurking behind any color of hair or style of hairdo for that matter. In other words, brother, the color of her hair tells you nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The United States. Army, after searching diligently for a suitable means for testing the qualifications of men before duty assignments, at last fell back on the ancient Scriptural test of men,</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>The Situation Test</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">What befell Israel in their arduous travels through the wilds and the desert was purposed by Jehovah to “prove them” or “test them”. (Exodus 16:4; Deuteronomy, 8: 2,16) Besides subjecting the nation of Israel to trials of their devotion and faith, Jehovah tested out individuals for specific assignments or honors. Before Abraham became the “father of all them that believe” he was subjected to a situation test that would have staggered even worthy men of less faith. (Romans 4:11) Abraham was commanded to slay his only son. God put this great test upon Abraham, and after he steadfastly endured this crucial test, He gave him a bountiful promise. —Genesis 22:16,17, Am. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Stan, Ver,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Polls, tests and questionnaires are currently popular. Even the “question test&quot; which is now employed to rate or gauge the individual’s attitude toward marriage, politics, sportsmanship, etc., and to measure his qualifications, intelligence, and numerous other attributes, is not new. Nearly a thousand years before Christ a famous queen resorted to similar methods. The record states; “Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon through* the name of the Lord, she came to test him with hard questions.”—1 Kings 10:1, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">An American Translation,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">An article in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Fortune</span><span class="font12"> magazine, March, 1946, describes the army combination question and situation tests for picking personnel. “Their scales: three and a half days of skilled observation of a human being as he worked, played, talked, and went through thirty-five lifelike situation tests.” In a footnote the article states: “There is nothing new about situation tests. See Genesis 22; 1-13; Judges 7:2-7; 1 Kings 3:16-28.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The summary of these observations is that the Bible judgment of men based upon their conduct under test is really the only reliable one. It is impossible to judge accurately by exteriors. To avoid errors of prejudice </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">it is best to stveep </span><span class="font12">the mind of all bias to the effect that race, face, head, hand or hair indicate special qualities. Doing so, the witness of Jehovah/ particularly, will reserve judgment awaiting the attitude of the individual toward the Kingdom, which is the essential test upon all peoples today.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">V/ skin coat !” Betty's voice was frill of excitement* For days Jean had been helping her find </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">a winter</span><span class="font12"> coat, and now, tucked away on the corner rack, was what she was looking for. Quickly the two read the label, just to make sure: “Bonded and Guaranteed, Genuine Hudson Bay </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Seal/'</span><span class="font12"> As Betty tried it on all her tiredness from shopping vanished and over her crept the warm flush of exhilaration and satisfaction* Stroking its smooth and glossy surface her hands fairly tingled wdth joy. Jean too commented on its sweeping lines and the sleek black ripples running down its back* “Outstanding, exquisite!” And how much? The original price had been slashed during this midsummer sale ; it was now only $300. That was still a lot of money for Betty, but, after all, here was a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Seal,</span><span class="font12"> something she had for a long time dreamed of owning. “It will last a lifetime/’ Jean assured her. No, Betty could not resist a bargain like this, and so she took it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Several years went by and fashions changed. Meantime, through a very dear friend, Betty became acquainted with a furrier who was more than willing to re-and without charge. Only then did she learn, and to her great sorrow, that her “Bonded and Guaranteed” coat was nothing more than a good imitation made of dyed rabbit skin! Yes, she should have known that there are no fur-bearing seals in Hudson Bay, and that “Hudson Bay Seal” is only a trade name in the fur industry. But it was too late* All Betty could do was console herself with the knowledge that she was not the only one that has been deceived by phony labels and fake “guarantees” on furs. Over and over again d thousand times this example of fraud has been duplicated by one of the most lucrative rackets found in the unscrupulous world of commerce.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Some may laugh at Betty’s calamity as her just desert. They may accuse her of violating the “everlasting covenant” concerning the sanctity of blood, of being indirectly responsible for the death of hundreds of animals, and of being a shallow-minded creature who bought the fur coat only to satisfy her vanity. Grave and serious charges, these, and, if true, thousands of other women are under the same condemnation. Who is responsible? Who started the fashion of fur coats for women? and who is to blame for the abominations found in the furrier business today?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Any inquiry into these questions of necessity takes one a long way back in history, for the use of furs and animal skins for clothing is almost as old as man himself. In fact, one reads in the third chapter of man's oldest history book, the Bible, that none other than Jehovah God “made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed them”. The historian Paul, apostle of Christ, tells how the ancient witnesses of God “wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins”. God’s faithful prophet namfed Elijah, the Tishbite, was “girt with a girdle of leather about his loins”. Moreover, Ezekiel, another prophet of the Lord who lived in the seventh century before Christ, says that badger or sealskin was included in a wardrobe fit for a queen.—Genesis 3:21, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver,; </span><span class="font12">Hebrews 11:37; 2 Kings 1:8; Ezekiel 16: 10, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Secular history tells a dramatic story of travel and exploration in the quest for furs. One of the most famous and colorful explorers, Marco Polo, in the year 1298, spoke of costly fur skins like ermines and<sup>1</sup> sables. The real pioneers of North America were not the tillers of the soil, the miners, the lumbermen or the scientists, but, rather, they were the fur trappers and traders. Pushing over the wilds of uncharted plains and crossing .unknown mountain ranges, always in advance of civilization, these hunters of fur laid out the sites for what are now many of America’s cities. The fur companies, the first being the Dutch West India Company, then the Hudson’s Bay Company, which monopolized the field for two hundred years, and still later the Northwest Company of French-Canadian merchants, each contributed to the history of this period, a history written in the mingled blood of both men and animals. At one time 40 dead men could be counted out of every 100 persons engaged in the fur-trading business. How many millions of animals were slaughtered for their fur in this ruthless and reckless period, when conservation of the young and protection of the food and shelter reserves were overlooked, will never be known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Only when men saw the fur-bearing </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">18</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">animals on the verge of extinction did they awake to their senses and take measures to protect wild life. But it was too late. The natural resources were no longer able to meet the demand, and so fur-farming was undertaken. In 1866 the first mink farm was set up in the state of New York, and in 1894 silver fox, a particular color phase of red fox, was first raised on Prince Edward island, in Canada. By 1938 Canada alone had over 8,000 mink and 2,200 fox farms. Attempts have been made at raising other animals, but with not too much success. Some have tried farming coyotes, skunks, badgers, raccoons, beavers, fishers and martens. With the swamps of Louisiana still yielding more than 6,000,000 muskrats a year, the raising of these has not proved profitable. A few years ago eleven chinchillas, natives of the South American Andes, were brought to California, and since then these little animals that look like rabbits with squirrel tails have multiplied until today some 2,000 U. S. breeders are raising over 30,000 chinchillas.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>From Raw Pelts to Finished Furs</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">.All together, the farms furnish about 40 percent of the total value of furs that now reach the market, the remainder of the nearly 100 different types of pelts come through the channels of international trade from every corner of the world. In a general way, furs are grouped according to family: rodent, dog, bear, weasel, cat, pouched, hoofed and miscellaneous groups, including monkey and seal. The families are subdivided, as, for example, there are </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">water rodents</span><span class="font12"> (brown, black and Southern muskrats, beavers and nutrias) and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">land rodents</span><span class="font12"> (squirrels, rats and rabbits). Each of these, then, the squirrels, rats and rabbits, etc., is divided into species. Furthermore, the value of a fur depends on the geographic location from where it comes, the time of year when It was taken, as well as the physical conditions of both the skin and fur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">All of these factors dictate to a large degree what treatment the furrier gives the furs in converting them into wearing apparel. First the skins are softened up and cleaned of any fleshy particles, after which they are “buttered” and treated with oils to make them soft and pliable. Excess grease is removed from the fur by tumbling the skins in a drum of sawdust Nowadays machines have replaced the old hand methods of treatment</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">While some furs are used in their natural color, many are subjected to dyeing, blending, pointing and “letting out” processes that are carried out according to many trade secrets* It is here that the “tricks of the trade” work their greatest counterfeiting magic. By dyeing cheap, unattractive rabbit furs they can be transformed to look like rare and elegant sable, mink or ermine. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Blending, </span><span class="font12">also called tipping, feathering and shading, is for the purpose of altering the natural color pattern of the fut to make it match that of other skins. Instead of dyeing the whole skin, the dyestuff is brushed on the fur only. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Pointing</span><span class="font12"> consists of inserting by hand white hairs in the fur to make it match more desirable and more expensive furs. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Letting out</span><span class="font12"> refers to the lengthening of a skin with a sacrifice of its width* By cutting mink furs into narrow diagonal strips 1/4 to 1/16 inch wide, then sewing them together again, coats appear to be made of 40-inch skins instead of 14-inch ones. Trickery in the fur business is considered an art.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The fashioning of a coat out of 100 or more separate skips is far more difficult than merely sewing together pieces of a crazy quilt* The individual skins are first matched with each other and trimmed to fit together. Then they are pinned on a stiff pattern and sewn so that there is no buckling. After taping the coat to retain its shape, progressively it is then interlined, lined, finished, glazed, ironed, combed, beaten, and nnally as a finished coat it is examined for any defects.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Facts You Should Know About Furs</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">The Federal Trade Commission and Better Business Bureau has done much in recent years to prevent the fur industry from openly misrepresenting furs, but still there are many hidden ways in which the customer can be cheated. While only an expert can correctly evaluate a dyed, blended and pointed fur, yet the layman can detect some of the grosser flaws in furs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A good-quality fur should be evenbodied, sleek and glossy, with soft, downy underfur. It should be uniformly colored, and the leather must be soft and pliable* Poor furs, on the other hand, show bare spots that are visible when the fur is blown apart. Matted areas, faded, discolored or dull patches, stiff or shabby hair, are markings of poor skins. If the leather is brittle or shows yellowish or reddish discolorations it has not been treated properly* Examine the skins along the bottom of the coat and on the underside of the sleeves, where the inferior fur is usually placed. Remember that dyed skins are not as high-quality as the natural ones; the distinction can be observed by parting the fur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Workmanship, construction and the materials used for the lining, armshields, etc., are also items that make the difference between two coats of the same price. It is a fundamental truism that the price tag is no indication of either durability or beauty)<sup>7</sup>. “Quite to the contrary,” says Gottlieb in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Fur Truths,</span><span class="font12"> “it may be generally assumed that the finer and costlier the fur the less durable; ^Taking the otter as the standard and giving it a rating of 100, some authorities list the other natural furs as follows: beaver, 90; seal, 75; mink, 70; raccoon, 65; sable, 60; muskrat, 45; fpx, 40; squirrel, 25. Chinchilla, the most expensive fur, is rated at only 15; and rabbit, hare and coney furs, from 5 to 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Rabbit or coney fur, though not too durable, is considered by furriers to be one of the most versatile; for when dyed it is sold as an imitation, of expensive furs under more thah 65 different trade names; Hudson Bay, Arctic and Polar Seal, New Zealand and Roman Seal, Baltic Leopard, Tiger, Fox and Seal, Twin Beaver, Chinchillette, Ermiline and French Sable are only a few. Rabbit fur holds all records, with a. yearly total of more than 200,000,000 skins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There is probably no other name in furs that thrills and captivates the imagination of women more than the mystifying monosyllabic word </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">mink.</span><span class="font12"> From childhood girls are taught that the height of success is to be wrapped in a mink coat. Truly, they think, it is an infallible half-mark of high-level society. .What sells minks is not so much their practical warmth, beauty and. softness as it is their exclusive' and uncanny ability to glamorize and glorify the wearer in the eyes of others. Genuine wild Labrador mink coats priced from $7,000 and up, mutation mink coats for $25,000, and ranch-raised minks beginning at $2,500, are available for those who can afford them, but for the other mink-crazed females there are “genuine imitation minks” available for a few hundred dollars. What’s the difference, one said, “to misses minus means, it’s mink!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In any event, whether one buys one type of fur coat or another, they should insist on getting a written guarantee specifying not only the trade name of the fur, or also the zoological name or the animal from which the skin was taken, and whether the fur is natural, tipped, pointed, blended or dyed. Such a written guarantee should state how long repairs are to be made without charge, whether free annual summer storage is included, and whether such is cold storage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Those fortunate enough to own a fur coat in these days of inflation should give it the best care, in order that it might retain its color, gloss and serviceableness over the longest period of time. Friction, dirt and moths destroy the fur; sunlight and excess heat make the leather brittle. Once a year, therefore, it shpuld be cleaned, and then stored for the summer in a refrigerator unit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At. first, furs served man as articles of utility, to furnish warmth and protection from the elements. Later, when the furriers artfully embellished them with the quality of beauty, it did not necessarily take away from their usefulness, for a good fur coat possesses much greater warmth per ounce of weight than cloth fabrics. Economically, one of good durability will outlast several cheaper cloth coats. Because society’s fashionable few idiotically drape themselves with a fur wrap in midsummer does not mean that practical people like Betty, who wear furs-in the; winter to keep themselves warm, are full of vanity. Nor is it right to say they violate the “everlasting covenant” in using the skins of animals as garments of clothing.</span></p>

The United States presidential elections were ranked fourth. The South African elections were held on May 26, and resulted in the defeat of the govern-nent led by Field-Marshal J. C. Smuts and a narrow victory for the South African Nationalist Party.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There were instant repercussions throughout the world. In South Africa itself the final returns were greeted with unbelieving surprise, to be followed by hysterical rejoicing on the one hand and stunned consternation on the other. In the city of London, financial center of the British Empire, near panic developed, and gold shares dropped £15,000,000 in value overnight. In America, too, South Africa became headline news. India eyed the new government grimly, spoke of fascism and prophesied trouble. Everywhere the world took note of the change and almost everywhere the world shook its head. One exception was Roman Catholic, anti-British Quebec, where news of the defeat of the Smuts government was received with undisguised pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Many reasons have been advanced to account for the defeat of the Smuts government: the desire of the people for change; irritation at controls; administrative blunders in domestic policy; Field Marshal Smuts' recognition of the State of Israel. But the issue on which the election was fought was clear-cut. It was, What policy should white South Africans pursue toward their non-white fellows? The inescapable fact is that the Nationalists were able to command enough support for their color policy to put them into power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">An observer of other days reported that he found in Canada “two nations warring in the bosom of a single state<sup>1</sup>; One wonders what he would have said of South Africa today. For within South Africa are crystallized almost all the racial disunities that afflict the earth. The broad division is between the white and the non-white. The whites are again subdivided into Afrikaans-speaking (mostly of Dutch descent) and English-speaking (mostly of British origin). The nonwhites are subdivided into Native Africans, Coloreds (mixed-blooded), and Asiatics (mostly Indians). And the Natives are again subdivided into different ethnological and racial groups, speaking different languages and with different customs and traditions. And among all these divisions and subdivisions there exist, in varying degree, racial enmities and racial prejudice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The broadest gulf stretches between white and non-white. The color bar operates to keep these two broad divisions separated socially, economically and politically. The issue on which the election was fought was whether this division should be continued and extended, or whether concession should be made to the development which the non-whites have achieved in recent years and the color bar relaxed economically and politically while retaining its social prohibitions as they exist. On this issue, which is of mOre than national importance, white South Africans were fundamentally divided. The urban areas voted solidly for economic and political relaxation of the color bar. The rural areas voted even more solidly for the retention and extension of the color bar in every aspect of South African life. The urban areas are largely English-speaking; the rural areas, largely Afrikaans-speaking; and’ this line-up on the question of color has hardly changed in a hundred and fifty years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Background of the Problem</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When the.British, in 1806, took possession of the Cape of Good Hope for the second and final time, the problem of race and color in this southwest corner of southern Africa was already a matter of bitter concern. The white man was then, as he is now, a minority ruling race. Under him were the remnants of the land’s original inhabitants, the Hottentots and Bushmen. To them had been added a large imported labor force of slaves, consisting mostly of Malays and East and West African Negroes. The Colored (mixed-blooded) population was already large and growing. And on the eastern border of the Cape a hew flood of color threatened the white man’s supremacy. For while the white man had been invading southern Africa from the southwest the African Bantu had been moving into it from the northeast, driving the Hottentots and Bushmen before them. Now Bantu and white men had met, and the Bantu were a race of warriors, savage and ruthless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The white South Africans who had now come under British rule had their own methods of dealing with the color problem in all its complexities. The struggle for existence in a wild, inhospitable land had molded them into a hardy, independent, individualistic people. Generally known as “the Boers” (Dutch</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“farmers”), their language was already showing strong divergences from the mother Dutch. Their color policy had one main principle: the white man was superior in all things to the non-white and must remain so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Conflict between British rulers and Boer inhabitants was not long in coming. For the British, under strong missionary influence, enjoined a policy of liberalism which though admirable in theory -was largely out of touch with reality. The missionary<sup>7</sup> view presented the non-whites as noble savages who but needed gentle handling to develop into Christian gentlemen. The Boers were described bitterly and unjustly as “halfwild Europeans, suffering from a complete corruption of their moral sense . . . almost sunk to the level of savages.” </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">{The Great Trek,</span><span class="font12"> p. 89)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To the Boers, suffering under repeated raids from the “noble savages” across the border, and irritated and thwarted daily by the lethargic, incompetent labor •with whose help they had to wrest a living from the not over-fertile soil, this “unjustifiable odium” was infuriating. And when the inference of British policy began plainly to appear as a denial of the doctrine of inherent white superiority and a recognition of all men as potentially equal the Boers had had enough. With almost religious fervor they packed their ox-wagons, left their homes and broad fields behind them and in their thousands crossed the borders of Cape Colony into the wild, unsettled country to the north and east, where after many hardships and vicissitudes they founded the Boer republics of the Transvaal and Orange Free State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Division Today</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Boer republics of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State are now voluntary members of the Union of South Africa, and Boer and Briton to all outward appearances form one united nation. But division of opinion on the</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">question of color was not bridged by the Act of Union, and the election of 1948 was fought on the 150-year-old issue: Which color policy, that qf British liberalism or of Boer Conservatism. And the Boers won.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But the political situation in South Africa today is far from being a clear-cut division between Briton and Boer. There have been conversions and defections on both sides. The British liberal tradition is represented in South Africa by the United Party, led by Field-Marshal Smuts, a Boer by birth and upbringing, one-time enemy of Britain and one of the most successful Boer generals in the Anglo-Boer War of still bitter memory. Now recognized as one of the world’s senior statesmen and, with Mr, Winston Churchill, as one of the two greatest men the British Empire has produced, he has for many years been the focal point of English hopes in South Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Boer conservatism is represented mainly by the Nationalist party, led by Dr. D. F. Malan, D.D. Pledged to preserve the Afrikaans language, tradition and way of life, this party has the support of most Afrikaans-speaking South Africans. Its republicanism and antiEmpire sentiment have, iflitil recently, denied to it any substantial English-speaking support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But in the recent election Dr. Malan pleaded for a common meeting ground for white South Africa. He agreed to shelve indefinitely his republican program and to fight the election on one issue only, the color problem. The solution which his party offered was frankly the color policy of 150 years ago. And when Dr. Malan raised it as his battle cry South Africa was amazed to see those who had been Dr. Malan’s bitterest'opponents, the extreme ultra-Btitish imperialists, rallying to his standard and proclaiming him as the savior<sup>1</sup> of white civilization. They formed but a small proportion of the English vote but their support was sufficient to give the Nationalists their majority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Nationalists emphasize a hard, and, for the Europeans, a foreboding fact: the whites are outnumbered by the non-whites by more than four to one and the higher over-all increase rate of the latter promises that their numerical preponderance will grow greater with the passing of time. Obviously white South Africa is in danger of being swamped by a flood of color. Opponents of the Nationalists are very conscious of the threat, too, but Smuts, the internationalist, sees something else; the eyes of the world are on South Africa in her dealings with her non-white races, and legislation which may be construed as repressive will almost certainly have international repercussions inimical to South Africa’s interests, and to the unity of the British Empire. For the empire now includes two great non-white dominions, India and Pakistan, and already South Africa’s color policy has caused these two new dominions to complain bitterly.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>“Apartheid” and the Empire</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">The cornerstone on which the Native policy of the republics was built was strict segregation. And segregation, known in South Africa by its Afrikaans equivalent, “apartheid,” is the policy on which the Nationalists have won.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is difficult for the lay mind to follow all the intricacies of the apartheid theory, but the broad idea is that the various racial groups should be contained in areas reserved for their exclusive use and should there work out their own destinies according to their own desires and abilities. The Natives (of course) and perhaps the Coloreds and Indians, too, would be allowed to cross over into the white man’s zones to labor for the white man’s needs, but they would not be allowed to make their homes there, or to bring their families with them, and would have to go back to their own areas on the expiry of their terms of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But South Africa’s color problem is complicated by the fact that her nonwhite races are in various stages of development. This is particularly true of the Bantu, those one-time rival invaders of the white man, who now number nearly eight million of a total population of hardly more than eleven million. Most of them are no more than semicivilized; some of them are hardly less primitive than they 'were a hundred and fifty years ago; but many of them have made rapid progress along European lines, and some have become in every respect the intellectual equals of the white man. It is the great weakness of South African Native policy that the law in effect places all Natives on the same plane, that of the semicivilized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The white man’s problem has not been made any easier by the insistent cry in some quarters for equal political rights for all. Many consider that equal political rights for all in South Africa is at present just not practical, for millions of its adult population have the mental development of children. Responsible non-European leaders appreciate this, among such ones being Mr. Manilal Gandhi, son of the Mahatma. But it is difficult to justify denial of full political rights to Mr. Gandhi and other educated and cultured men among the Indian, Colored and Native communities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Overseas observers have dubbed the Nationalists “Nazi zealots” and fascists. It is true that during the second world war the Nationalists openly hoped for and expected a German victory. It is true, too, that their leaders flirted with certain extreme Afrikander organizations, Such as the Ossewa Brandwag, which loudly proclaimed the virtues of the Nazi State. And it is true that almost the first official act of the new government was to liberate certain ones who had been sentenced to long terms of imprisonment for wartime sabotage and treasonable acts on behalf of Nazi Germany. But it is still doubtful whether the new government can rightly be called totalitarian in outlook. It is a fact that the desire which many Afrikanders had for a German victory was inspired not so much by a love of Germany but by a hatred of Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Nevertheless, there is little likelihood of South Africa’s seceding from the Empire. Germany, whom the Nationalists in company -with many others throughout the world once regarded as the main bulwark against Bolshevism, is gone. The Nationalists, hating Communism even more than they once hated Britain, now look to the West, to the British Empire and America for protection from the Red peril, and the new government has openly recognized the political, ctoriomie and strategic value to South Africa of her place in the Empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But the apartheid theory does contain a threat to the peace and unity of the Empire. For while there may be doubts as to the economic soundness and ethical rightness of apartheid it cannot be doubted that any attempt to put it into practice will occasion grave national and international reaction. Within South Africa itself apartheid would bring to open flame racial bitternesses and antagonisms already smoldering ominously, while in the wider councils of the world South Africa’&quot;would have to face universal criticism and disapproval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">For white and non-white South Africans alike one sentence in the.Nationalist party’s pre-election manifesto reads ominously. In a statement outlining the apartheid policy, published on March 30, Dr. Malan had this to say: “Churches and societies which undermine the policy of apartheid and which </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">propagate doctrines foreign to the nation</span><span class="font12"> will be checked.” As the unofficial state religion of South Africa is now Dutch Reformed Calvinism, it is logical to assume that any doctrine that conflicts with the teachings of Calvin may be construed as being “foreign to the nation” and a fit subject for checking.—</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> correspondent in South Africa.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Not Responsible for World’s Morals</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">T</span><span class="font12">HE clergy of Christendom’s hundreds of religious denominations disavow Jehovah’s witnesses and stoutly aver that these were not ordained by them. Good! say the witnesses,.for our ordination is Scriptural; genuine ministers are not made by men or religious clergy, but are made by God through Christ. That was what the apostle Paul claimed as true about himself. Theological training at the feet of Rabbi Gamaliel did not induct Paul into the Christian ministry. The gospel of which Paul was a minister was not according to man, and he did not get it of man, but was taught it by the revelation of Jesus Christ. (Gab 1:11-17) We can thus see that Paul was not a servant of the Jewish organization that rejected Jesus Christ. He was not a minister of Judaism or “Jews’ religion” with its traditions of the religious fathers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Today, like Paul, Jehovah’s witnesses act separate from all the religions organizations of Jewry and Christendom. They are not ministers of the hundreds of confusing religions of Christendom, but are “ministers l&gt;f the gospel”. With this gospel they exclusively -work. This gospel, and not the wisdom and religious ideas of men, they teach privately and preach publicly. With this gospel they are trained, instructed and built up in Christian faith with it. Acquaintance with this true gospel, then a dedication of themselves to make it known to others, is what makes them gospel ministers. They reject the religious traditions of Christendom as “old wives’ fables” and profane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If those of us who are ministers specialize on the gospel, how can we at all dabble in the morality campaigns and the politics of this world, or try to dictate what the movie industry shall produce or the cinemas show on the screen, or act as referees in capital-labor disputes? We simply cannot. Those things of this world are not our concern. We cannot line up with the governor of Minnesota, who, at a Reformation Day celebration in November of 1947, said publicly: “We are personally responsible for the political conduct of our democracy. If Christians in the United States do not reverse their indifference to government, the&lt; time may quickly come when a decision will be forced upon them as a result of our apathy. . . . they must come forward to accept the obligation of leadership and service in political and civil life as never before in the history of our nation.”—New York </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font12"> November 3, 1947.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Would Christ Jesus, would the apostle Paul, heed that urgent warning or invitation to entangle themselves with the political affairs of this country, if they were personally present here now? Not if they stuck to the line of action that they followed when on earth nineteen centuries ago. Christ Jesus owned up to no responsibility for the political conduct of any nation, but quietly said to politician Pilate: &quot;My realm does not belong to this world.” (John 18:36, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt)</span><span class="font12"> And Paul wrote to Timothy: “Endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth en-tangleth himself with the affairs of this lifethat he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.” (2 Timothy 2:3, 4) Both Jesus and Paul his faithful imitator kept hands off this world’s running of its affairs and stuck to the ministry of the gospel. When Jesus Christ was offered the charge of all the political states of this world it was not Jehovah God, hut it was Satan the Devil, “the god of this world,” that made the offer to Christ Jesus on the terms that Jesus fall down and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">worship the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Because Jesus Christ was a minister of God and devoted to the ministry of the gospel, He refused to enter politics in league with Satan the Devil. For holding to this neutral course He was foully put to death by a political conspiracy. But no blame can be cast upon His ministry, as being fraudulent </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">If the pope of </span><span class="font12">Vatican City, who claims to he Christ’s vicar, had instructed the Roman Catholic clergy to follow Jesus’ example and $tick to the gospel, Monsignor Josef Tiso would not have entered the political office of president of Slovakia as a protectorate of Adolf Hitler and have taken part in slaughtering thousands of helpless Slovakian Jews, and all this time being on good terms with the Vatican, and finally appealing to Hitler for military aid when the allies were closing in upon the Nazi forces. Condemned after trial in court, Tiso was hanged as a criminal and Nazi collaborator April 18, 1947. Just his being a Roman Catholic priest did not earn for him a pardon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">By no means can God’s true ministers of His gospel undertake to act as the custodians of the morals of the state or of the public community that upholds such a political state, and try to put Jehovah God in the state. We cannot by making laws give people an injection of righteousness and morality. Not even the law of Moses could legislate righteousness into God’s chosen people of Israel. That Theocratic law could only condemn them as natural-born sinners in Jehovah’insight and needing redemption, redemption through no political legislation, but through Jesus’ blood. The Roman Catholic priests that try to influence legislation to inject their Roman Catholic righteousness into the people merely serve to legislate themselves into power for controlling the community, Catholic, Protestant and Jewish. The apostle Paul knew better than to try to act as custodian for the morals of the people of Rome and other lands that </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">he visited. lie said to the church at </span><span class="font12">Corinth which had a disgusting case of fornication on its hands: “What have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within? But them that are without God judg-eth.”—1 Cor. 5:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The apostle foretold that at the end of this world, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">where we are now,</span><span class="font12"> the nations would have dropped to their lowest ebb, creating most perilous times, and that there would never be any improvement. (2 Timothy 3:1-13) The failure of Christendom’s clergy to improve the morality of the people of the various political states proves theirs is a losing fight, because it is no business of a true minister of God. Why, the true ministers of His Word cannot even force the gospel of salvation upon anyone; and it is only through that gospel that any person attains to real righteousness and morality in God’s sight. How, then, can Christendom’s ministers of religion hope to regulate the morality of the political state and to legislate uprightness into the people that do not accept and obey the gospel of God in Christ Jesus? They cannot. Jehovah’s witnesses are well instructed in that gospel. They do not let themselves be fooled into joining the religious clergy in that futile effort which does not have God's approval or </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">backing. Only God’s kingdom established </span><span class="font12">in the hands of Christ Jesus will bring in a world completely moral and upright, a new world, and not this old world made over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">American Bill of Rights </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued front page 8) </span><span class="font10">to the other groups of the community, often becomes himself suspect. . . . Yes, it takes courage to stand between an unpopular minority and the community, insisting'that our Bill of Rights was designed for the protection of all people, whatever their race, ereed or political faith. The lawyer, may feel uneasy when it seems that important clients may slip away because of his attitude. The editor may be tempted to stand mute by reason of the views of important advertisers. Even the clergyman may be under pressure to hold his tongue because of the influence of some of his parishioners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But those who are devoted to the democratic ideal expressed in our Bill of Rights will take, the direct and daring course. Once they are sure of their facts and know they arc doing right they will, like Altgcld, espouse the cause of the victims of ignorance, prejudice or passion. They, too, may be pilloried or cursed. But institutions become great by the greatness of the men who champion them, by the greatness of the advocacy that defends them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A people indifferent to their civil liberties do not deserve to keep them and in this revolutionary age may not be expected to keep them long. A people who proclaim their civil liberties but extend them only to preferred groups start down the path to totalitarianism. They emulate either the dictatorship of the Right or the dictatorship of the Left, In doing this they erase a basic distinction between our system of government and totalitarianism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To allow that to happen is to lose by default. Far better to lose pleading the cause of decency and of justice. Then we win greatness even in defeat, and leave behind a rich heritage for those who later rebuild on the ashes of our lost hopes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But there will be no failure if we adhere steadfastly to our faith. For the goal of people of alb races is toward a system which respects their dignity, frees their minds and allows them to worship their God in their own </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">way. </span><span class="font10">None has yet designed an article of political faith more suited to those ends than our own Bill of Rights,</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Vigilant Ones</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">The foregoing establishes the worth of the American Bill of Rights, particularly the first of those ten amendments. The wisdom of having these freedom guarantees in writing, and having them interpreted by the courts, is also manifest. Legislatures and executives are frequently subjected to political pressures, are sensitive to arguments of expediency, are responsive to psuedo-pa-triotic pleas. All this makes it difficult for the individual, especially of an unpopular minority, to protect himself. By the very nature of their appointment members of the legislatures, as well as some executives, are representatives of the majority. It may be politically dangerous for them to champion the rights of minorities. But with the courts interpreting the rights guaranteed to all persons there is more hope for justice. As Mr, Justice Chapman of the Florida Court of Appeals said, in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Wilson</span><span class="font12"> v. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Russell</span><span class="font12"> (1941): “A court in the discharge of duty under our system is required to be oblivious to public clamor, partisan demands, notoriety, or personal popularity and to interpret the law fearlessly and impartially so as to promote justice, inspire confidence and serve the public welfare?’ Hence a tribunal can dispense justice better than a body that is obliged to keep one eye on the public press and the other on the ballot box.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But before the courts, can safeguard liberties, vigilant ones must challenge those who would encroach thereon. None have been more vigilant in this regard than Jehovah’s witnesses. Their fight for freedom has piled high favorable court decisions bulwarking civil liberties for all. They have helped establish not only what may be said in the exercise of free speech and press, but also how it may be disseminated to an audience. They have kept these freedoms tax-free and license-free. Truth may not be choked oft because it offends some others or is controversial. It penetrates to all corners of the nation, by virtue of decisions won against company-owned towns. Moreover, the Witnesses have advanced the cause of free worship by their victory in the flag-salute case. Forced salutes could lead to oppressive regimentation, and the eventual forced 7m/ing of a variety of Hitlers. Also, if vigilant fighting had not turned back the attempt to brand Jehovah’s witnesses seditious because they advocate God’s kingdom, then other religious groups supporting that kingdom could be similarly convicted. It is as Judge Edward F. Waite said in an article in the Minnesota </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Law Review </span><span class="font12">(1944) entitled “The Debt of Constitutional Law to Jehovah’s witnesses”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is plain that present constitutional guarantees of personal liberty, as authoritatively interpreted by the United States Supreme Court, are far broader than they were before the spring of 1938; and that most of this enlargement is to be found in the thirty-one Jehovah’s witnesses cases (sixteen deciding opinions) of which </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Lovell</span><span class="font10"> v. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">City of Griffin </span><span class="font10">was the first. If ‘the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church’, what is the debt of Constitutional Law to the militant persistency —or perhaps I should say devotion—of this strange group?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the United States freedom-lovers have a good fighting chance to preserve their liberties through their written Bill of Rights. The United States affords the individual more protection of his personal freedoms against governmental encroachment, state or federal, than that available in any other of the United Nations/ By appealing to the Bill of Rights, invoked through judicial review<sup>7</sup>, any exercise of power by the executive or legislature can be scrutinized by the courts and &quot;weighed on the scales of freedom. The American Bill of Rights has thus proved its worth. Why should not the citizens of any one of the other Unit-<sub>t</sub> ed Nations have their personal rights made as legally secure?</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">War of Words in U» N-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&lt;$&gt; The United Nations, belying its name, is at its assemblies a battleground for a war of words. T*hls perennial conflict bro Ke out afresh as the third General Assembly convened at Paris on September 21. Present were (500 secretariat members from Lake Success together with 000 others hired In Europe’ AWit 1500 correspondents, from some 43 countries, were there to cover the meetings. The 58 national delegations on hand represented three-fifths of the earth’s surface, and four-fifths of its people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Early in the sessions the assembly U. S. Secretary of State Marshall made a speech and said that American patience should not be mistaken for weakness, and that no basic principles would be set aside to reach an agreement with Russia* Russia’s delegate Vishinsky mdted two days later saying that Russia sought co-operation with all nations but that the U. S. followed a “policy of expansion and realization of plans for world domination”. He accused the U- $* of planning the use of atomic bombs for the destruction of Moscow, Leningrad and other great Russian cities. Apart from hearing speeches the Assembly decided upon its agenda. Russia opposed the inclusion of reports of' the Balkan and Korean Coin mi s-sions, the proposals of the, &quot;Little Assembly”, and a motion condemning Russia’s refusal to al* low Russian women who have married foreign husbands to leave the country. Prominent on the program were consideration of the Palestine question, the Berlin impasse, the Greek problem, the Indonesian trouble, and the Trieste governorship.</span></p>

They decided by the following day to send an urgent message to the Kremlin, which was done on Wednesday, identical notes going to the Soviet ambassadors in Washington, London and Paris. The Soviet replied with unusual promptness and by the end of .that week preparations were under way Ln Paris tor a meeting of the Big Three's ministers to discuss Russia’s reply, which called for Russian control of air transport into Berlin. On September 26 the ministers drafted a speedy reply. Briefly, they said, Nothing doing. “Identic notifications” were accordingly sent to the U. N. charging that the Russian blockade of Berlin and attendant difficulties were a “threat to the peace” of the world. And one wonders what peace.</span></p>

Widespread labor </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">pro</span><span class="font9">tests followed. Seven persons held for attacking the police had their sentences postponed, the judge saying, “All Frenchmen have the right to demonstrate, but they must do so In an orderly fashion.”</span></p>
