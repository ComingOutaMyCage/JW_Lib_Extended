<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Volume XXIX &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brooklyn, N.Y., September 22, 1948 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;">In the Wake of Gandhi’s Death</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">THERE are particular mo-ments in the history of nations </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">iqESffai</span><span class="font16"> when the people, stimulated B by some violent passion, or some illicit advantage, or misled by the artful misrepresentations of interested men, resort to measures which ultimately entangle them in a circle of evil-doing and misery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Freedom had come to India in the wake of religious frenzy. Hindus and Moslems had brutally butchered each other. Millions of men, women and children had been driven out of their ancestral homes, broken in body and spirit, and forced to make a dusty, deadly trek in search of a new home. The dislocation caused by the mass migration of people between India and Pakistan had created problems of immense magnitude. Hindu communalism had grown to such an extent that it demanded the establishment of a Hindu kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Appalled by the evils of the movement and believing that he had a &quot;mission of peace” to fulfill, Mahatma Gandhi, India’s &quot;political father”, had since India’s Independence Day made efforts to dissuade the Moslem minority from leaving India for Pakistan. But early in 1948 the situation was at its worst in the capital city of India, New Delhi, and Gandhi had resorted to a fast for the purpose of restoring peace there and for restoration of full freedom to the movement of Moslems living in Delhi and the Indian Union. But by now fanaticism had so gripped the Hindu communalists that they feared not even to put Gandhi out of their way. Within a few days of his fast, a bomb was thrown in an attempt to kill him. And within ten days of this bomb-throw, on January 30,1948, he was shot dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The hopes that Gandhi had raised in the minds and hearts of the vast masses of the people were shattered. The sudden, violent end of the man who for many long years dominated the Indian scene plunged India into an abyss of gloom. Under the shadow of this calamity, Sarojini Naidu, governor of the United Provinces, lamented: &quot;Alas for the Hindu community, that the greatest Hindu of them all . . . should have been slain by the hand of a Hindu! That indeed is almost the epitaph of the Hindu faith.” Gandhi’s assassination came as a thunderbolt to the people of the country. It enveloped the land with a darkness even more complete than the tragedies of the preceding months. Deputy Prime Minister Patel called it &quot;a day of sorrow, shame and agony for India”.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>The Aftermath</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">How, then, is India facing the future and the perils that encompass it? The convulsions and heartbreaks of the past months have affected both the spirit and the outlook of the people. The majority do not quite know where they stand today, and doubts and disillusionment grip the populace. The Congress leaders confess that while the present is full of uncertainty, the future is even more shrouded and difficult to pierce. Nevertheless, people whose minds are in a fluid state, not knowing which way to look and what to do, can be wooed with promises and ideals of human conception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Propaganda and counter-propaganda worked up into a delirious crescendo by rival groups glaringly reveals the precarious position of India today. Communal rancor, provincial antipathies, sectional intrigues and various other elements have made fissures in the body politic and at key points deepen in intensity. Already a forceful movement for reorientation of the provinces on a linguistic basis is under way. The conflict may ultimately turn India into a second China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Following Gandhi’s death and when the prescribed period of thirteen davs of mourning enjoined by the Hindu religion had elapsed, Prime Minister Nehru sought to console the nation and to allay the fears in the public mind as to the future policy of the government. Said he:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">We must remember that India is a common home to all those who live here, io whatever religion they may belong. They are equal sharers in our great inheritance and they have equal rights and obligations. Ours is a composite nation, as all great nations must necessarily be. Any narrowness in outlook, any attempt to confine the bounds of this great nation, will be a betrayal of [Gandhi’s] final lesson and will surely lead to disaster and to the loss of that freedom for which [Gandhi] labored and which he gained for us in large measure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It was felt that the disruption of the country into two states, the grooving ferocity of communal violence, the increasing importance attached in many quarters to provincial interests, and the complexity of international problems made it necessary for India to be a compact, powerful and largely centralized state. Moderate leaders expressed the view that “separation (from the British Commonwealth of Nations) may satisfy our present feelings of resentment or national elation, but will not lead to the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">greater security of</span><span class="font16"> our newly created status or to its rapid growth”. That feeling is reflected in an amendment of far-reaching implications made in the Draft Constitution for India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“Sovereign Independent </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Republic&quot;</span><span class="font16"> was the original description sought to be given to India in Nehru’s “Objectives” resolution unanimously accepted by' the Constituent Assembly. Now the words “Sovereign Independent </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">State&quot;</span><span class="font16"> are sought to be substituted for the original description. The object of the amendment, as explained by Dr. Ambedkar, chairman of the drafting committee, was “to see that nothing in the constitution brings about the automatic and instantaneous severance between India and the British commonwealth of nations”. It is with the British Crown that the Indian Union is at present linked. India’s leaders will have to think until November, 1948, when the Constituent Assembly will finally decide on the subject, whether India should remain within this British commonwealth </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">or get out the way </span><span class="font16">Burma did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The general consensus of political opinion in this country had been for many years, in favor of complete independence. Partition, which was supposed to have facilitated or quickened the pace of transfer of power, has given rise to </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">problems</span><span class="font16"> of a complex and formidable character. Tied up closely with this is the growing sentiment that India should give up neutrality as the guiding principle of its foreign policy and more or less side with the Anglo-American bloc with a view to improving its international position.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Indian States in the Indian Union</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In order to have a correct idea of the situation, it is necessary to know the background. The term “Indian state” means any territory in India which was</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">not part of British India, and which was recognized as a state. Some 562 units were so recognized. They comprised a third of the area of undivided India and contained about one quarter of the whole population. The total area was 600,000 square miles, and the total population 93 million. They differed from each other enormously in size, resources and population. On one end is Hyderabad, with an area of 82,700 square miles, a revenue of one hundred million rupees per annum and 17 million subjects, and on the other end are petty chiefs whose territory consists of a few acres each. The internal government of the different states varies considerably. A few have legislatures and high courts. The majority are autocracies and feudal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Prior to partition the relations between them and the British Crown were regulated by treaty, grant, usage and sufferance. The British Crown, as the paramount power, offered advice to the rulers through Residents and political agents. The states were intimately tied to India by a variety of economic and administrative agreements. But by the Indian Independence Act the British parliament declared that the dominion of His Majesty over the Indian states lapsed and with it all treaties and engagements in force between His Majesty and the rulers of the Indian states.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Except a few states like Bahawalpur. and Kalat, which are contiguous to Pakistan, all the other states adjoin or are surrounded by the territories of the dominion of India. Their future appeared to be a thorny problem at one time and the activities of the States Department of the government of India were directed to the task of fitting the states into the Indian constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In co-operation with the rulers of the states, the transformation of &quot;Princely India” has been a fairly quick process. Within the space of six months many of the smaller states had ceded their administrative functions to neighboring provinces or to the central government; others had grouped themselves into larger units styled &quot;States Unions” and some had acceded as units of the Indian Union. In the result this motley crowd of feudal territories have been integrated into 30 units. It is conceded that, generally, the rulers have taken time by the forelock and made the best of a bad situation. Had they remained truculent they would have lost their domains and their wealth. As it is, they have saved their wealth, salvaged their privy purses and likely established a claim to political power and influence with the government of the Indian Union.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Of the two biggest states, namely, Kashmir and Hyderabad, the former has become an international concern although it has “acceded” to India. In the latter, situated “in the belly of India”, Indian Congress agitators for accession of the state to the Indian Union allege that the ruler’s court clique is taking advantage of a “standstill” agreement with India to convert itself into a “Southern Pakistan”.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Kashmir and Hyderabad Tangles</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In November, 1947, India, confident that it had an unassailable case against Pakistan, rushed to the United Nations Security Council with rosy hopes for a solution of its dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir. The deliberations in the Security Council dragged on for months; debate and private talks led nowhere; consideration of the dispute was adjourned, postponed and elbowed out of the way by other business which was assumed to be more, urgent. India was discomfited and disillusioned. A final decision is to await the report of a commission which the Security Council is sending to Kashmir to investigate conditions on the spot and to supervise the holding of a plebiscite to decide whether the state shall be incorporated into India or Pakistan. But its resolution on Kashmir is recommendatory rather than mandatory. As a consequence the execution of the resolution rests on the sweet will of the two disputants. The Kashmir problem is not easy to </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">solve. Bordered by </span><span class="font16">Russia, China, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, it is a political issue of immense consequences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Hyderabad with its 82,700 square miles and its 17 million people could not have the same relation with India as a petty state comprising a few villages and a handful of people. On the lapse of paramountcy the nizam of Hyderabad, who is a Moslem, claimed that he was entitled to “resume status of independent sovereign” but the question of the nature and extent of association between Hyderabad and the units in British India “remains for decision at a later stage when their constitution and powers have been determined&quot;. At the end of November, 1947, India and Hyderabad signed a “standstill agreement” for one year. Hyderabad has since then continued to be a tough problem both for the Indian Union and for the nizam. Nobody knows how it will be settled and when. Will His Exalted Highness introduce responsible government in the state? Will Hyderabad accede to the Indian Union or maintain an independent status? These are the main questions about Hyderabad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In January, 1948, India’s agent-general in Hyderabad stated: “Hyderabad cannot stand still despite the standstill agreement. Hyderabad is India and India is Hyderabad, bone of its bone and flesh of its flesh, and nothing can part it from India, for the people of India are one and indivisible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The Moslems of Hyderabad expressed fears that the Hindu majority of 85 percent within the state, with the help of the Hindu majority without, may oust them from their age-old position of prize and power. Opinion in Hyderabad thereafter hardened and Hyderabad made it clear that while it would never accede to India, it is equally unwilling to let the majority prevail at the present stage in the Hyderabad government. Protracted talks have ensued for so many months that people have almost lost count of the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">times India and Hyderabad have </span><span class="font16">negotiated.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>India, “Pillar of Hope”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Asaf Ali, Moslem supporter of the Congress party and hitherto Indian ambassador to Washington, is reported as stating on his return to India: “All the south Asian and north African- states and peoples are eagerly looking up to India as the pillar of hope for the future. We must resolutely solve our own problems as quickly as we can and keep ourselves ready to play the role which history has assigned to us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But such ‘counsels of perfection’ and appeals for “co-operation and a joining together of all the forces which want to make India a great and progressive nation and to realize in this generation the dreams of Gandhi” failed to find a response from the younger elements within the National Qongress. Led by Jay-prakash Narain, the Socialist wing of the Congress, it is alleged, tried to make political capital out of the critical situation. Soon after Gandhi’s death Narain drew pointed attention to the weaknesses of the central administration. He demanded the removal of the communal elements from the government in order to meet the crisis which confronted the country. He urged that the administration be </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">purged of communal saboteurs </span><span class="font16">and replaced by democratic-minded nationalists, He called upon the legislatures to enact laws for depriving people of obstinate communal views of the right of franchise, because those who did not believe in democracy had no rights to democratic privileges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The spark of action given by the refusal of the Socialists to be bound by cords of fidelity to the Congress perhaps made other supporters of the government to realize how, under the fagade of constitutional legality, a single party using familiar methods of intimidation can establish -a dictatorship. It was no surprise, therefore, that further weakening of the government front became apparent. Dr. Ambedkar, law member of the government and leader of the so-called “Depressed Classes”, the outcastes of Hindu society, seized the opportunity to take full advantage of the quarrel between the Congress and the Socialist party by advocating a “third force”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Addressing a conference of the Scheduled (Depressed) Castes Federation on April 25, Dr. Ambedkar justified his acceptance of the Congress offer to him to enter the government on the'-grounds that he saw he could serve the interests of the Scheduled Castes better from within the government than from without and, since he was the law member, the Scheduled Castes had no fear of bad laws’ being made to their prejudice 1 What they had to fear about was bad administration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">’ In regard to the future he said there was no use joining the Congress. There must be opposition to criticize the government. The government may otherwise easily become dictatorship. It is a house that is burning, he added. The Congress itself is getting divided. The Socialists have gone out; how big they will grow one cannot say now. So he advised his hearers to form a third party in order that the Scheduled Castes may be able to hold the balance, thereby obtaining bargaining power ! “If you organize you can even capture the government,” he exhorted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Charging deputy prime minister Patel with dictatorial ambition, the Socialists by April 15 definitely broke with the Congress. In a 1,000-word resolution on the political situation, the Socialist party convention declared that “with the achievement of freedom, the role of the Congress as the joint front of the Indian people had come to an end. The Congress talked of socialist slogans and a cooperative commonwealth, but after the attainment of freedom, instead of the Congress’ running the administration, the administration was running the Congress”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The Socialists, they said, were leaving the Congress because the Congress was no longer the liberating instrument but was a limiting force, it being overwhelmed by anti-secular, anti-democratic forces of the Right. According to a Socialist leader, the Congress governments both at the center and in the provinces are sitting tight over their steam-roller majorities and becoming Fascists; deputy prime minister Patel was forming states unions, which was admirable, but why should- he pay millions of rupees to the former princes except to get their support in the formation of a conservative party; the Congress ministries were formed in the provinces on the basis of caste; it was against the democratic principle of casteless society; in the name of emergency, government was arming itself with powers which the British government did not possess; the new Security Act and Special Powers Ordinance enabled the government to muzzle the press.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">The word “ordinance” is hated by all politically-conscious Indians: it bespeaks the harder aspects of the former British raj. In one aspect matters are worse than under the British, for then freedom always loomed ahead. Now there is nothing more to look forward to. Therefore the use of the same methods by a government that claims to have won freedom has shocked the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The government’s defense was that </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font16">section of the people were conspiring to overthrow it by violent means; that unrest among labor grew considerably and there were strikes in factories; that a large number of arms were being collected and the security services were faced with a grave danger of being sabotaged. It therefore had to take steps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The “national” government thereupon swobped down upon the Communist party,. totally banned it in one province and harried it in more. A future all-India ban is by no means improbable. This repressive measure should be seen in the perspective of world events. Men and women have been summarily arrested and detained without trial. Arrests, widespread though they are, do not remove the sources of Communist strength. The best of the leaders have gone underground. Their power to cause trouble is not materially weakened by the arrests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The Communist threat cannot end by repression. The virtual illegalization of the Communist party gave rise to certain fundamental issues of civil and democratic liberties which a large section of progressive thought cannot ignore. It asks: Is government to be permitted to suppress all civic freedom through undemocratic methods? The government had worked itself up to a position wherein all strikes are virtually illegal and suppressed by force. The right to strike is regarded in all democratic countries as a fundamental right. To take away </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">.this right, it is argued, is</span><span class="font16"> to be steadily moving toward a police state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The suppression of the Communist party, presumably prompted by motives of self-preservation, non-Congress circles aver, was precipitate and unstatesman-like. It suggested that the Congress is trying to silence all opposition and to </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">create a really monolithic state.</span><span class="font16"> “Opposition is too readily equated with sabotage,” they comment. But the Congress governments both at the center and in the provinces, it is contended, have given a poor account of themselves insofar as reconstruction of India is concerned. Many problems that vitally affect the common man have been left unsolved. Such a failure, it is pointed out, is not due so much to incapacity as to intransigence and influence of Big Business.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">In India today there are huge differences between certain groups, classes and individuals. There is a wide gulf between those who are at the top and those who are at the bottom. The vast majority of India’s toiling masses suffer from hunger and poverty. Their sole cry is for more food and cloth, for the barest necessities of life, for the recognition of their claims to the minimum of human standards. Moreover, that India lives mainly in villages is a fact that often tends to be forgotten when people talk about plans for industrial development and social welfare schemes. Only 2 million out of India’s 300 million are in industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Apart from the fact that nearly 85 out of every 100 are illiterate, the latest available economic data show that less than one in a million persons even begins to approach the standards by which riches are measured in a country like America. But, of course, the disparity is not just confined to the wealthy minority. In America 1 man in 4 owns a car, -whereas in India only 1 man in 5,000 possesses one. Every other American has a radio set, but in India only one in 1,500. The average American’s span of life is 60 years; the Indian’s, 26. America’s average per capita income is 30 times that of India, while per capita consumption of electricity in the U. S. A. is 160 times as high as this country. An average American working life is nearly 41 times that of an Indian. Indian production potentiality at present is not more than 15 percent of the American, the Englishman, the Japanese or the Russian, These are the effects, rather than the causes, of India’s poverty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Viewed in the light of these facts alone, the colossal task before India under human rule must prove baffling to the ablest administrator the nation can produce.—</span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">-Awake! </span><span class="font16">correspondent in India.</span></p>

But the promised new world will last forever. Note the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Jehovah is the Creator of that new world, and He is “from everlasting to everlasting”. Its King, Christ Jesus, “hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach urito.” His joint-heirs redeemed from among men who reign with him “must put on immortality”. And the kingdom government that will reign over paradise earth is an enduring one: “Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion en-dureth throughout all generations.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">Then maybe the earthly home of men will come to a fiery end, as the fundamentalist religions teach?

<p><span class="font16">No doctors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Well, maybe the inhabitants will die at a ripe old age. “The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.” “There shall be no more death.”—1 Corinthians 15:26; Revelation 21:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">No funerals. No somber undertakers. Why, even the inroads death has made into the human family during past centuries will be turned back, as the graves of ancient time give up the dead prisoned in them: “Marvel not at this; for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth.”—John 5:28, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Certainly these prophecies give us a vision of something that is “out of this world”. Jesus said, “My kingdom is not of thist world.” He told men of good-will toward God to flee from this world to gain life in Jehovah’s paradise earth. So be an escapist from this present evil world by fleeing to the new one whose builder and maker is God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">And do not let the present woes trouble you overmuch. They were foretold to come -in large doses during these “last days”. (2 Timothy 3:1-5,13) Because such woes are sure signs that the incoming Kingdom is at hand, they are dark clouds that have the most silvery of linings! That is why Jesus encouragingly said concerning them: “When these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.....know ye</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">light. But they produce the same effect upon a photographic emulsion as ordinary white light. Hence these rays can penetrate the flesh of the human body and record pictures of the more dense structures, for example, the bones. This ability of the rays to see through you and tell what they see on a photographic plate makes them an immense asset to the medical profession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">A</span><span class="font16"> SEALED glass tube containing a high vacuum and having two electrodes for admitting an electric current —that is what led to the discovery of one of the marvels of the twentieth century, namely X^ray.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In 1895 a German physicist, Roentgen, while experimenting on the passage of an electric current through rarefied gas in a sealed glass tube, noticed that when the pressure inside was reduced changes and phenomena occurred. One was that the electrons or negative particles of electricity liberated from the gas traveled at right angles toward the<sup>T</sup> positive terminal, and on striking the walls of the tube gave up 99 percent of their energy as heat and the remainder became X-rays. “X-rays” he called them because their nature was not understood at that time. Roentgen further discovered that when the electrons strike the tube or any substance of high atomic weight the point of impact becomes a source of new radiation, producing more X-rays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Further experimentation disclosed other peculiarities of the rays. Though traveling at the same speed as light (186,000 miles per second), the X-rays have a much shorter wave length (high-</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Developing X-Ray Tubes</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">After the discovery of X-rays and their possibilities, the hunt was on for efficient ways of producing the rays. X-ray tubes were the results. The earliest one was a glass bulb with two projecting arms, nearly evacuated of air, or sometimes filled with hydrogen or other gases. On each arm a terminal is attached, and which is connected with a soufee of electricity. When the current is sent through the gas becomes ionized and electrons are liberated* The electrons were driven toward the positive terminal or anode of the tube, where they gave up their energy and the rays were produced. However, these tubes soon passed out of use as the inconstancy of the vacuum made it difficult to always produce the required amount of rays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">To offset this a hot cathode tube was designed, by W. D. Coolidge. He based his tube upon the fact that metals when heated liberated electrons. Coolidge fixed a spiral of tungsten wire at the cathode</span></p><img src="g_E_19480922_files/g_E_19480922-3.png" alt="" style="width:254pt;height:81pt;">
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Radiator type Coolidge tube</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">end which could he heated by a supply of current independent of the current necessary to drive the electrons. A current of about 12 volts heats the tungsten and liberates the electrons, then a potential of between 25,000 and 100,000 volts, flowing always in one direction, drives the released electrons across the gap separating the cathode and anode. The anode consists of a metallic block of tungsten, which arrests the electrons and converts part of their energy into X-rays. This tube is much better than the gas type of tube, in that by- varying the current heating the spiral of tungsten wire the amount of electrons liberated can be varied, and the speed of the rays can be varied by varying the voltage that drives the electrons from cathode to anode.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">As time passed improvements were made by different manufacturers. For example, the shape and size of the anode or “target” have been improved so that it can take a great amount of energy (heat) without cutting down on the quality of the rays. If the anode is too large many rays are produced, of different wave </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">lengths, and</span><span class="font16"> instead of having a pencil of rays of great penetrability there would exist several weak rays of poor penetration power and they would give a blurring effect upon the photographic film.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">To overcome this is the line focus tube, whose anode is a block of copper with a small disk of tungsten (the focal spot) fused in the face of the copper. This is the type now in use in modern X-ray laboratories. Early types of tubes combated the heat released by having radiators attached to the back of the anode or baths of oil, but modern tubes are cooled by radiation.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Medical Use of X-Ray</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">When a part of the human body is placed in the path of the rays they will meet resistance according to the various tissues of the body. Those coming in contact with flesh meet with little resistance, hence will more or less pass through. Lesser amounts will pass through the bones, and more rays will penetrate certain parts of the bones, as they vary in density. Since the rays affect film as does ordinary light, if a photographic plate is placed under the bodily part on which the rays are falling, a picture will be made of the bones and joints. The image will vary in shade according to the density of the various parts of the bodily area being photographed. Where nothing blocks the rays the film will be black, where there is only flesh in their path the film will be a little less dark, but where there is bone the film will show gray or white. Incidentally, most of the rays are absorbed; comparatively few pass through to produce the desired picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The film placed in the path of the rays is usually a piece of paper or celluloid on which is -suspended in gelatin emulsion fine crystals of silver bromide. If the X-rays alone were depended upon to produce the picture or radiograph very long exposure Would be required, which would mean blurring on the film and damage to the tube. Hence the film is placed between intensifying screens. These consist o'f cardboard coated with calcium tungstate. When the rays strike this substance it becomes fluorescent, which intensifies the effect of the rays. The fluorescence acting upon the film instead of the rays themselves produces a greater effect. And this discloses another quality of X-rays: they cause certain substances to become fluorescent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The film goes to the darkroom for developing. A solution of metol, hydro-quinonne, sodium sulphite, sodium carbonate, potassium bromide and water is used. The bromide molecules of the silver bromide combine with the solution and metallic silver is deposited on the film, thus giving a picture, of the part X-rayed. Following developing, the normal fixing, washing and drying as in ordinary photography is carried out. Thereafter the film is reported on by the radiologist for progress or diagnosis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In examining boneless organs opaque liquids must be used. For example, the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">stomach is made of</span><span class="font16"> membrane transparent to X-rays and the patient must have his stomach filled with an opaque liquid, usually barium sulphate suspended in water. Then the X-ray will show up the outline of the stomach and intestines. In the ease of the kidneys the opaque liquid is injected to show up the urinary tract and bladder. Similar treatment is required to photograph the gall bladder.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>X-Ray and Fluoroscopy</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Another branch of X-ray work is fluoroscopy, vhere advantage is taken of the fluorescent effect of the rays. They are allowed to pass through a screen of calcium tungstate, which becomes fluorescent and converts the rays into rays of a wave length visible to the human eye. This enables the radiologist in a dark room to observe the working of any organ, especially the stomach. Such method of examination would be preferable to X-ray photographs if the image were bright enough, but fluoroscopic images are dim. </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span class="font16"> eye misses </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">much that the </span><span class="font16">camera would not. Hence the photographs are indispensable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But why not step up the intensity of the images by increasing the intensity of the rays? There are machines that can do this, but a limit is imposed by the amount of radiation that the human body can absorb safely. However, in May of 1948, research physicist John Coltman announced that he and his colleagues had succeeded in brightening fluorescent screen images 500 times. After the X-rays pass through the human body they enter a small pilot tube, strike a fluorescent screen, release light rays that in turn strike a photosensitive surface and knock off electrons. As the electrons are released they are accelerated across the tube by a tremendous voltage “kick” and hit a second fluorescent screen at a speed of 5,000 miles per second. This speed is what releases a flood of light rays from the second screen and gives the far brighter image then viewed by the physician. In the first practical tube the high-speed stream of electrons will be “compressed” to form a final image only one inch across (one-fifth as large as the original X-ray image). This compression will brighten the image even more. As a final step, the intensified image will be restored to its original size by an optical magnifying system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">X-rays also have biological effects and are used in the treatment of skin diseases. Suitable doses of the rays have a destructive effect on unwanted cells. This also would indicate that overdoses of the rays might bring serious and undesirable consequences; and so they do. Damage to the superficial tissues, changes in the blood and damage from shocks are some of the dangers involved. Modern laborafories have suitable shielding </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">facilities to absorb scattered</span><span class="font16"> rays and thereby reduce to a minimum the first two dangers mentioned, and danger of shock is almost entirely eliminated by improved methods of wiring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The benefits derived from X-ray far outweigh the dangers. Diagnosis of disease and determination of position of fractures, and location of foreign bodies, etc., are much more easily accomplished. This branch of medical science continues to expand and improve as the years roll on, to the benefit pf millions the world over.—</span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font16"> correspondent in Jamaica, British West Indies.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>LIE ON THE COUCH</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">66TS </span><span class="font16">THERE a couch in the house?” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">J. </span><span class="font16">This may soon become the stylish cry to replace the old-fashioned call for a doctor when someone collapses. The couch, of course, must come equipped with a psychoanalyst to lurk in the shadows and eavesdrop on the subconscious as the person reclines and aimlessly babbles. From his concealed listening-post the civilized head-hunter stalks the wary subconscious till it is enticed into the open via the carelessly wagging tongue, whereupon it is pounced upon and its secrets pried from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">You may not know it, but any progressive modern can tell you that your subconscious is an arch-villain, long since replacing the dastardly knave of the blacksnake whip and twirling mustache who tied fair maidens to railroad tracks when not sawing them asunder. Instead of the breath-taking hero of brawn and beauty to the rescue, now comes the brainy psychiatrist to grapple with the stubborn subconscious, to needle and bait it with sly questions and promptings till he has wrung it dry of all the wickednesses it has repressed since infancy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Of course, the trail is a long one and the battle tough. He may have to fish in the murky pool of the subconscious and hunt through the mazes of its wilderness for an hour a day, every day of the year, for one or two years before he flushes into the open all its secret inhabitants. The chase is an expensive one, costing' anywhere from ten to fifty dollars an hour, but the results in the end are worth it. The patient can climb off the couch</span></p><img src="g_E_19480922_files/g_E_19480922-4.png" alt="" style="width:256pt;height:114pt;">
<p><span class="font16">as sane as the brilliant psychiatrist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Psychiatry has been boomed till it has caught the public fancy and become a fad. It is stylish to be psychoanalyzed. Everyone needs it, we are told. Psychiatrist Bond, Of Philadelphia, recently claimed that only about one million Americans are normal mentally. In fact, the claim is that psychiatrists should put under their care all classes of persons, from world leaders to ditch-diggers. Would it be impertinent to ask if this means a board of psychiatrists would oversee the mental health of other psychiatrists?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Alas, there are not enough psychiatrists to unload all the neuroses and psychoses that are burdening down the masses. Estimates are that there are 5,000 in the United States, some 400 of whom are psychoanalysts. But into their green pastures flood some 25,000 psychoquacks, and the qualified psychiatrists wail that these fakers are “swindling out of the public an amount of money beyond belief”.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>Sigmund Freud the Founder</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The cornerstone of modern psychiatry is Sigmund Freud. His theory is that memories unacceptable to the conscious mind are submerged in the subconscious mind, forced there because too painful for the ego to tolerate; But this repressing of unpleasant memories produces mental and physical illness, Freud reasoned, and if the patient were forced to recall the original painful emotion or episode he would be freed of his sense of guilt or fear or inferiority and get well. So Freud devised a trap for the subconscious. He had his patients lie on a couch, let their mind wander and their tongue wag. Freud sat out of sight and listened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">After months and sometimes years , he claimed to locate the psychic wound at the root of the patient's trouble. This process Freud called psychoanalysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">After examining many patients Freud became convinced that neuroses invariably had their origin in some sexual episode of adolescence; no, not just adolescence, the wounds often rooted themselves as far back as infancy. Back there the sexual instinct was driven from consciousness by the taboos of society and took refuge in the subconscious. In later life it forces itself back to consciousness as some neurotic symptom. Sex is the foundation of Freudian psychology, and the entire theory is pretty much of a nasty reflection on human nature. While many psychiatrists swallow this pill of pansexuality like good little disciples, many others gag at it and call it filthy, vile and obscene. Not do all psychiatrists support the practice of psychoanalysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Perhaps the thought of someone wiser and more powerful than man was painful to Freud's human ego. At any rate, he eliminates the existence of God the Creator with this vague mental ramble:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Psychoanalysis concludes that the God-Creator really is the father, clothed in the grandeur in which he once appeared to the small child. Even the grown man feels that fundamentally he is just as helpless and unprotected as he was in childhood. He therefore looks back to the memory image of the overrated father of his childhood, exalts it into a Deity and brings it into the present and into reality. The emotional strength of this memory image and the lasting nature of his need for protection are the two supports of his belief in God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Psychiatry -would supplant God and</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Christ as the savior of the world. The </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Humanist,</span><span class="font16"> March, 1948, opined: “Without the extensive help of psychologists and psychiatrists it is quite probable that mankind will not long survive the fearful changes which are taking place.&quot; Psychiatrists, conquerors of the wily subconscious, were recently urged (by a psychiatrist, of course) &quot;■—<sup>to r</sup>°U <sup>U</sup>P ^heir sleeves, — &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>s</sup>^<sup>orin</sup> the fastnesses of</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">—----=—— But let us get to know</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">our would-be saviors a little more intimately, a little more humanly, considering their insights into everyday living. And if some of their conceptions make you wonder whether the jokes about psychiatrists' being crazier than their patients are really jokes, be patient. They also have egos to protect and feed, and the more unusual, the more startling their theories, the more attention they draw.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">First question: Do you know why an embarrassed girl blushes? Your answer will be wrong anyway, so save time and listen to Dr. Ernest Dichter, reported in </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Pageant,</span><span class="font16"> June, 1947: “The blushing of an embarrassed girl is believed to be a remnant of animal behavior. Many animals in the course/of evolution changed color in order to fit less conspicuously into their environment. Some, like the chameleon, still do.&quot; Blushing girls, for your comfort, the chameleon is a lizard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Hasty ones might think that they see a flaw in this reasoning, since animals change color and become inconspicuous, whereas the girl’s blushes make her more conspicuous. But they should not try to outwit the psychiatrist, for he is ’way ahead of them and explains: “The fact that a blush draws attention rather than averting it exemplifies the ineptness of the unconscious as an arbiter of action for civilized man. ... As with the blush, actions which made sense in one stage of evolution do not necessarily make sense in a civilized state.” This hardly seems to make sense in any state, but may we conclude that when uncivilized man wore skins and lived in caves and dragged his woman about by the hair the shy maiden’s blush at such tender treatment would render her inconspicuous?</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">Psychiatrist-author Eric Berne says: “Many people are in love, or angry or afraid for ten, twenty or thirty years without being aware of it until they come to a psychoanalyst.” Never propose or count to ten or run till a psychiatrist tells you whether you are in love, angry or scared. On the subject of anger, Dr. Wolff, of Cornell Medical College, said “a mad nose caught with its resistance down is easy prey to colds and other infections”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">According to the Baltimore Sun, psychiatrists “have come up with a typically psychiatric reason for headaches”. Psychiatrists say that repressed hostility causes migraine or nervous headaches. The cure? Simple: blast away without restraint at your pet peeve and get soothing relief. Tell your boss what you think of him—and lose your headache and your job. Tell your friends their faults—and watch them and your headache fade from your life together. </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Give </span><span class="font16">your mother-in-law that piece of your mind you have wished to for so long— then defend yourself from receiving fresh and worse headaches. Also, in loosing anger to rout headaches you may give your mad nose a cold, according to Dr. Wolff. So count the cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Know why we seek more goods, more money, better cars to keep up with the Joneses? and indulge in competitive sports and pursuits and even war? On March 1 Dr. Kubie, professor of psychiatry, revealed that in </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font16"> this we were merely carrying over the repressed and forgotten nursery rivalries. He glibly contended that “to the end of our days we remain children </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">emotionally, fighting </span><span class="font16">out our nursery battles”. According to Dr. Kubie, the remedy is to grant the child “the right to feel and express his feelings as a fifth freedom. This may ultimately prove to be the most important freedom of all&quot;. So if your child kicks your shins and turns your house into a shambles, do not bottle up in him those conflicts. Grant him his fifth freedom, though it spoil him and your purse.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Crime and Mystery Stories</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">More instruction on children from psychiatrists, this time from Dr. Abra-hamsen, of Columbia University, clears up the causes of juvenile crimes. Where there is bickering at home the children tighten up with resentment, which finds its outlet in criminal activity, and not only criminal activity but also illness. The. article in the New York </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Times, </span><span class="font16">April 4, that reports Abrahamsen’s views concludes: “So we have stomach and other troubles which are self-made for the purpose of arousing sympathy. For the same reason many offenders are prone to have accidents.” In similar vein the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Chirolite,</span><span class="font16"> August, 1947, discusses the 133,000,000 </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">neurotic persons in the United</span><span class="font16"> States and says: “Many individuals and families in this group are poor insurance risks because they seem to have an affinity for accidents.” Some </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">say the </span><span class="font16">frequent accident victim or ailing person seeks sympathy ; others, that he has an unconscious urge to commit suicide. At least they are agreed that it is the victim’s fault.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Psychiatry has interesting theories on why people like mystery stories. One is, it is an outlet for the killing instinct A second is, the reader is a passive person who identifies himself with the victim in a desire to be overwhelmed. Commenting on the latter reason, nationally-known psychiatrist Edward Strecker, a mystery-story fan himself, said: “While I probably do not know just why I enjoy reading murder mysteries, I feel very sure that .the gentleman doesn’t know either,” referring to the psychoanalyst who advanced the theory. Undoubtedly the motive for. reading them is a very evil one, as claimed good motives are only ruses to fool the ego and entirely out of harmony with psychiatric principle. Perhaps Strecker’s subconscious is repressing his evil motive from his consciousness to save his ego the humiliation of knowing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">While on the subject of mystery and crime, we note a report in the Milwaukee </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Sentinel,</span><span class="font16"> August 9, 1947, about a convict that was pardoned, and the statement: “Unsound advice from a psychiatrist was blamed for his mistake.” Again, there is the case of Stuart Allen, teenager in Missouri that cold-bloodedly beat to death a 58-year-old man with a hammer, and then bored holes in his body with an electric drill. He calmly asserted: “My theory is that I have been reading and thinking too much about the psychological.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Getting away from the gruesome, Dr. Margaret Mead tells why some suffer from insomnia. When children they were sent to bed early as punishment. Now, as adults, they re-fuse to yield to fatigue and go to bed, but stay up late and read, and become insomniacs. Do you know why some women are frigid and man-haters? </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">PM,</span><span class="font16"> June 21, reports that psychiatrist Isaac Frost attributes marital frigidity to “whippings received by the wife during her childhood” and that spanking little girls “could bring about lifelong hatred of men”. A week earlier </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">PM</span><span class="font16"> reported London psychologist Dr. Hadfield as claiming that “anesthetics given mothers during childbirth may kill their love for the children they painlessly bear”. And here is one that will make you persons that have always quailed before the rasping dentist’s drill feel foolish. </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font16"> magazine, May 12, 1947, reports psychiatrists from Illinois University claiming: “Most of the pain people feel during dental drilling is no doubt only psychic.” Dentists have been seriously urged to study psychiatry and doctor, their customer’s minds before filling their cavities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">One of psychiatry’s triumphs is learning why people get fat. Do you know? Overeating, you say? Superficial reasoning I Listen to Dr. Hilde Bruch, psychiatrist at Columbia University, as reported in the New York </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font16"> October 8, 1947:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">If ene learns to understand fat people more intimately it gradually appears that their tremendous size, which they so loudly bemoan, </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font16">not without a positive emotional meaning for them. It seems that in the insecure and unstable relations to the surroundings physical size and bulkiness seem to convey a feeling </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font16">strength, safety and power to the timid fat child. The heavy layers of fat seem to act as protective walls against an outer world which the fat person often experiences as unfriendly and threatening. Many fat young girls, though outwardly very concerned about not getting married, nevertheless persist in remaining fat because it is a protection against men and sex and the responsibilities of adult womanhood which they dread even more than the disgrace of being fat. . . . The obese adult, like- the fat child, is emotionally immature, passively dependent and helpless in meeting the exigencies of life. He seeks comfort in overeating in the face of failure and of frustrating </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">ex</span><span class="font16">perience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You Can't Win!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">After this array of wisdom the most stubborn holdout against modern psychiatry must give in, subdued, crushed. By now you must know that the psychiatrist sees all, knows all, tells all. Never obvious, always deep, he burrows beneath the shallow surface thinking of ordinary humanity and dips into the subconscious to bring to light the answers. Consider his shrewd wisdom:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">If you make friendly advances, you are not being sociable, but are conceited and forward. If you are shy and quiet, you are not being modest, but are a coward. If you strive to love your neighbor as yourself, you are not moved by a desire to do good, but are only tickling your own ego and making it think you a fine fellow. If you wear informal clothes, you are not seeking comfort, but are showing a spirit of rebellion. The remedy? Wear formal clothing? Shallow thinker! The formal dresser also has an ulterior motive. He suffers from a feeling of insecurity and assumes formal garb as a hard outer shell to hide a soft, defenseless kernel. (Of course, he could get fat and take refuge behind its folds.) Those who overdress or underdress, wear slinky dresses or dramatic hats, flash sporty ties or plaid jackets or bright suspenders, all such dressers are in hiding. They are afraid to accept themselves as they really are and they try to deceive others along with themselves as to their real nature. They are fugitives from reality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">So, whether you are forward or backward, do good or evil, are fat or slim, overdress or underdress, dress formally or informally, blush or do not blush, get sick or well, stay calm or get angry, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">ad infinitum, ad nauseam,</span><span class="font16"> you have a nasty motive for it. Regardless of what you think you arc or what your friends think you are, the psychiatrists know you to be a rat. It just goes to show that you cannot fool around with the psychologists. The American Equity Association of Washington, D.C., was so overwhelmed by the infinite wisdom of these mind-probers that it made this offer in writing: “$1,000 will be paid to any psychiatrist who can prove he or she is not insane.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">This sacrilegious thrust at the Freud sect and its offshoots is sometimes duplicat</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">ed by those who are mentally unbalanced. Take the case of Laura, for instance, as related in </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Saturday Evening East, </span><span class="font16">October 18, 1947. For fifteen years Laura was considered a hopeless case of schizophrenia. She ate only when forced. She had not uttered a word for three years. She always sought to curl into a ball. She was so resting when well-known Dr. Strecker, of Pennsylvania Hospital, made ward rounds with some students. He stopped at Laura’s bed, and unburdened himself of his professional wisdom: “Laura has split herself off from the world of reality. We do not know what caused her to do so, but, according to Freud’s theory of schizophrenia, she has made a complete regression to an infantile state and is seeking to resume the fetal position.” Laura had heard a lot in the past fifteen years, but this did it She raised her head. She looked at Strecker. She looked at the students. Then she spoke her mind: “Did you ever hear such d----nonsense in all your life?” Laura</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">got well and got out. While Strecker got credit for the cure, many sane people doubtless prefer Laura’s opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Before opening our arms to the psychiatrists as our saviors, let us consider the case of Annie the Ant The New York </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Star,</span><span class="font16"> July 14, 1948, reports the United Press dispatch from Scotland:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Annie the Ant twitched her legs and antennae today in what was believed to be the first nervous breakdown ever suffered by one of the ant family. She was given a maze test— in which ants find their way to food through twisting passageways. A smart ant learns to negotiate the maze after a few tries, and Annie is a smart ant. But Annie took a wrong turn the other day. She worried so much about still being in the maze, instead of on the food pile, that she developed a neurotic complex. That, at least, is what scientists of the Institute of Animal Genetics contend. They are trying to cure her.</span></p>

<p><span class="font25">T</span><span class="font16">HE president of the Catholic War</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Veterans, Anthony H. Forbes, in announcing on July 16, 1948, that a school would be opened in Washington, D.C., for the training of “officer” units to light communism, proposed that “every Catholic boy entering the service be given a rosary”* A few days before, at the annual Independence Day rally of the Knights of Columbus, “the Rev. Patrick Peyton called for a return to the practice of reciting the rosary in family groups.” (New York </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font16"> July 5, 1948) On May 1, of this year, Walter Palumbo arrived in Rome with a “box full of prayer beads” from Philadelphia residents for the pope to bless* Back in October, 1945, “Rev.” William J. Taylor said: “The present nation-wide movement to promote the family rosary promises to become a great crusade for the revival of religion in the home.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Such news items make thoughtful persons ask why intelligent men and women in this twentieth century should be burdened down with a string of beads. Is there a Scriptural command to this effect or is there Biblical precedent for it? If not, who originated the practice and how long has it been in existence?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Instead of accepting the hearsay of so many people that say the rosary was given to “Saint” Dominic in the year 1208, we should go to a recognized authority, such as the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia.</span><span class="font16"> Here (Vol.. 13, pp. 186, 187) the Dominic story is called “current tradition” and is refuted by the following statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">We possess hundreds, even thousands, of manuscripts containing devotional treatises, sermons, chronicles, Saints' lives, etc*, written by the Friars Preachers between 1220 and 1450; but no single verifiable passage has yet been produced which speaks of the Rosary as instituted by St. Dominic or which even makes much of the devotion as one specially dear to his children* * * , Neither do we find any suggestion of a connexion between St. Dominic and the Rosary in the paintings and sculptures of these two and a half centuries. Even the tomb of St. Dominic at Bologna and the numberless frescoes by Fra Angelico representing the brethren of his order ignore the Rosary completely.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Rosary Used by Ancient Pagans</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Long before the Dominican order came into existence or became fanatically interested in the rosary it was in general usage the world around. In discussing the “controverted question of its history” and origin the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia </span><span class="font16">(Vol.. 13, pp. 184, 185) says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In almost all countries, then, we meet with something in the nature of prayer-counters or rosary-beads. Even in ancient Nineveh a sculpture has been found thus described by Layard in his “Monuments” (I, plate 7): “Two winged females standing before the sacred tree in the attitude of prayer; they lift the extended right hand and hold in the left a garland or rosary.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Archaeological discoveries in Ur, not far distant from Nineveh, show that as early as 3500 B.C. bead culture was more advanced than in any other country at the time. “Many of the stones had def-iiiite amuletic properties,” says the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span><span class="font16"> (Vol. 3, p. 252). Invariably the beads of that period of time show they served as talismans and were used in their worship of the Devil. The Saxon word </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">bede</span><span class="font16"> from which comes our word <sup>&lt;f</sup>bead” means a &quot;prayer” and originally the word &quot;bead&quot; was associated with the rosary. In Egypt the name for bead, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Sha-sha</span><span class="font16"> comes from a root word meaning “luck”. As for the name &quot;rosary” itself, it is of Chaldean origin, and is a combination of the words </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Ro, </span><span class="font16">meaning &quot;thought”, and </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Shareh,</span><span class="font16"> meaning “director”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Turning again to the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia</span><span class="font16"> it is learned that many other heathen had their thought directed by the rosary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It is certain that among the Mohammedans the Tasbih or bead-string, consisting of 33, 66, or 99 beads, and used Jor counting devo-tionally the names of Allah, has been in use for many centuries, Marco Polo, visiting the King of Malabar [on the southwest coast of India] in the thirteenth century, found to his surprise that that monarch employed a rosary of 104 (? 108) precious stones to count his prayers. St. Francis Xavier and his companions were equally astonished to see that rosaries were universally familiar to the Buddhists of Japan. [Vol. 13, p* 185]</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">To this can be added the fact that the rosary was used in the pagan rites of the anbient Mexicans, according to Humboldt's </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Mexican</span><span class="font16"> Researches. It is also employed by the Brahmans of Hindustan and in their sacred books reference is made to it time and again. In Tibet and among the millions adhering to the Buddhist faith of the East the rosary , has been used from time immemorial. Van Dyke, in his book </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Popery,</span><span class="font16"> says that one can &quot;see the worshipers of Buddha, ?ach with a rosary in his hand, prostrate themselves before an image and repeat their prayers”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Sir John F, Davis, in his book </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">China, </span><span class="font16">gives this description of the pagan rosaries :</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">From the Tartar religion of the Damas, the rosary of 108 beads has become a part of the ceremonial dress attached to the nine grades of official rank. It consists of a necklace of stones and coral, nearly as large as a pigeon's egg, descending to the waist, and distinguished by various beads, according to the quality of the wearer. There is a small rosary of eighteen beads, of inferior size, with which the bonzes count their prayers and ejaculations exactly as in the Romish ritual. The laity in China sometimes wear this at the wrist, perfumed with musk, and give it the name of Heang-choo, or fragrant beads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Also on the subject the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Dictionary of Religious Knowledge,</span><span class="font16"> edited by Lyman Abbott, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Chaplets [rosaries] are also in use in China among the worshipers of Fo, or Buddha, and were probably used by them long before they were known in Christendom. They consist of one hundred smaller beads, and eight considerably larger; and in place of the crucifix of the Romanist, they suspend a large bead fashioned like a gourd. There are also chaplets of various sorts in use among the Japanese,</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It is not a coincidence that in the Roman Catholic religion the rosary is closely associated with a symbol of a heart, and a worship of the &quot;Sacred Heart”. This too came down from the ancient Babylonian system, as pointed out by Alexander Hislop in </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Two Babylons, </span><span class="font16">page 188:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In the Church of Rome a new kind of devotion has of late been largely introduced, in which the beads play an important part, and which shows what new and additional strides in the direction of the old Babylonian Paganism the Papacy every day is steadily making. I refer to the “Rosary of the Sacred Heart”. It is not very long since the worship of the “Sacred Heart” was first introduced; and now, everywhere it is the favourite worship. It was so in ancient Babylon, as is evident from the Babylonian system as it appeared in Egypt</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The sacred symbol of pagan Egypt's Osiris was the heart. The sacred symbol of pagan Greece's Cupid was the heart The sacred symbol of the pagan &quot;Mother and Son&quot; worship of the ancient nations of Asia was the heart The sacred-heart symbol even extended down into demon-worshiping India.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>From Rosaries to prayer-wheels</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">After fashioning their rosary after the Buddha models the Roman Catholics may in time adopt the pray er-wheels of the inventive Buddhist priests. In fact, the idea is already being considered by papists. For example, over the imprimatur of C. Chauznont, VG., titular bishop of Arena, auxiliary bishop of Montreal, a &quot;Prayer and Agreement with the Sacred Heart of Jesus&quot; is printed in very fine type with the instructions; “It is sufficient to put this prayer on one’s heart in a scapular; by placing the hand on it, everything is said, Our Saviour is satisfied with our intention. May it please God to give all Christians knowledge of this pious practice?<sup>7</sup> The </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Gospel Witness and Protestant Advocate</span><span class="font16"> points out the similarity of this and how the prayer-wheel idea started, and then says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Long ago we read a story of some Buddhist priests who conceived the idea of writing their prayers on paper and waving it in the air in </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">belief that God would regard this as the equivalent of saying the words. Then in the course of time one of the brethren in this Eastern monastery conceived the idea of fastening the paper prayers to a water wheel and harnessing the flow of -a nearby stream to perform the labour involved in this kind of prayer. And finally when British engineers came along many centuries later to survey the site for a great hydroelectric development project, with a true English sense of property rights they formally recognized priority of </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">the monastery </span><span class="font16">s claim </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">on the water </span><span class="font16">power and </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">granted </span><span class="font16">it a certain share of the electricity which their modern generators produced on the ancient sjx;L And now, the </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">atory </span><span class="font16">says, </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font16">brethren in the Buddhist monaatery pray </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font16">machines turned by electrical power, with a </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">speed </span><span class="font16">and efficiency which would have amazed the primitive originators of the ingenious scheme of saying prayers by waving a paper in the air,</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">If G(m?s mercy and forgiveness is dependent on the number of times a certain prayer is repeated, and the repetition of a fixed prayer thousands upon thousands of times brings propitiation, appeasement, atonement expiation and reconciliation, then the prayer wheels of the Orient are far more efficient than the antique rosaries of Catholicism, However, it is this very repetition that brands both the prayer-wheels and the rosaries as pagan devil-worshiping practices of the heathen, and this is on the authority of none other than Christ Jesus himself. Said He: &quot;When ye pray, use not </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">vain repetitions, as the heathen do:</span><span class="font16"> for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking/<sup>7</sup> (Matthew 6:5-7) Itwas not the faithful Christian Paul that had a rosary when in Ephesus in Asia Minor, but it was the goddess Diana worshiped by the pagans of that city that was pictured as wearing a rosary. (See Kitto’s </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Illustrated Commentaries,</span><span class="font16"> 1340, Vol.. 5, p. 205J</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Truthfully the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia </span><span class="font16">says: &quot;To sum up, we have positive evidence that both the invention of the beads as a counting apparatus and also the practice of repeating a hundred and fifty Aves cannot be due to St. Dominic, because they are both notably older than his time/<sup>7</sup> Yes, indeed. They are as old as the devil-worship of ancient Babylon*</span></p>

<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">Prayer to God</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">O</span><span class="font16">NLY those who seek to become the children of God by forsaking sin and laying hold upon Jesus Christ the Son of God as their Savior are accorded the privilege of approaching God’s throne in prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The attempt to approach God thus implies faith in Him, and a realization that we depend upon Him, and that we believe the way of reconciliation of sinners with Him has been opened up through Christ our Savior, and that God’s purpose is to bring all the willing and obedient and faithful ones of humankind into the circle of sonship. When one praying says “Our Father”, it implies that such one recognizes there are other sons of God who, like himself, have fled from sin and seek adoption into God’s family through Christ; hence such one praying says “Our”, not “My”, “Father.” Whoever addresses God in prayer must have concern for the interests of all the family of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">When Jesus instructed His followers thus to pray He advised against making vain repetitions in prayer as the heathen do, and He made no reference to praying with a rosary with which a religionist counts the repetitions that-he makes of the same prayer to his deity at one season. The more clearly we recognize that the privilege of prayer is an exclusive one for sons or prospective sons of God, the more we shall be inclined to nse it in a most reverent way as instructed in the Bible, and not in a religious prayerbook. The kings of the earth make regulations about times, seasons, dress, etc., to be observed by those who wish to enter their </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">presence;</span><span class="font16"> and all who have a proper appreciation that the vindication of Jehovah’s name and sovereignty is the foremost issue before the universe will approach him in a worshipful, reverent attitude implied in the expression, “Hallowed be thy name,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">God’s kingdom by Christ Jesus is His effective means for vindicating Jehovah’s name and sovereignty, and therefore Jesus taught His followers next to pray: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” (Matthew 6:9, 10) The present condition of world distress, sin and death will not be everlasting. God has provided for His glorious kingdom under His Son, by which all evil will be conquered in heaven and in earth and be completely ousted by universal righteousness. Those in proper heart relationship with God long for the installation of that thousand-year reign of His Son, the anointed King, even though they know that this will be preceded by the overthrow of the present </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Satanic world in the coming </span><span class="font16">catastrophe of the battle of Armageddon. (Revelation 16:14-16) They do not pray for the political systems and governments of this world, because the Kingdom, for which they pray, will dash to pieces all the political organizations of this world, even all the nations, and thereafter God’s kingdom over this earth shall stand forever. (Daniel 2:44; Revelation 2: 26, 27) This kingdom will then proceed to bless all the families of the earth.—Genesis 12: 3, and 22:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In His model prayer Jesus included a petition for our needful bread, saying: “Give us this day our daily bread.” There is no attempt here to supplicate God for delicacies, but it is merely an expression of trust in Him and of confidence that He will provide, in harmony with His. promise that our bread and water shall be sure. Indeed, when we remember Jesus’ words in the same sermon on the mount, that the heathen have in mind what they shall eat, drink and wear, but that the heavenly Father knows what things we need (Matthew 6:31-33), we see that to the sons of God Jesus’ words respecting daily bread refer more particularly to spiritual food than to earthly food. Provision for all our necessities, both temporal and spiritual, according to God’s wisdom, is briefly requested in the above petition for “daily bread”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.” The debts here acknowledged in prayer are sins. Those here meant are those we commit after we have come into relationship with God by consecrating ourselves to </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">Him </span><span class="font16">through Christ. We ask for such forgiveness in the name and merit of Christ Jesus, for we read: “Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures.” (1 Corinthians 15:3) “He is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours Only, but also for the sins of the whole world.” (1 John 2: 2) For such reason we must ask for forgiveness through Christ. His merit not only covered the sins that are past and due to Adam’s original sin in Eden, but makes provision for our weaknesses and blemishes en route to the new world of righteousness that God’s kingdom will bring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The final words of Jesus’ model prayer are: “And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.” (Matthew 6:13) Or, modernly rendered: “And bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.” </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">(Am. Stan. Ver.) </span><span class="font16">The thought is that there is an evil one, namely, Satan the Devil, ever ready to attack Jehovah’s children, to the extent that Jehovah God grants the opportunity, just as He did in the case of Job to test and prove the integrity of that faithful man of patient endurance. Trials, testings and temptations are now necessary to prove our integrity and faithfulness to our heavenly Father; and since these things are necessary for that purpose and hence are permitted by God, it would not be proper for us to pray that God would treat us differently from His Son Jesus Christ on earth and would spare us from all trials and temptations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The thought of this prayer is, therefore, that God will not lead or bring us into temptation that would be too severe for us according to our measure of strength and Christian development. This thought is in full accord with the entire testimony of God’s Word. The promise is: “There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.” (1 Corinthians 10:13) The “evil one”, the Devil, would like to destroy God’s consecrated sons utterly, but he will not be permitted to do so. So far he may go, but no farther.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Because it was not the due time when Jesus gave the sermon on the mount, including this model prayer, Jesus did not then instruct His followers to pray this prayer in His name. But in His farewell discussion with His apostles on the night before He died on the tree He did instruct them to pray thus. He said: “If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.” “Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.” (John 14:14 and 16:23,24) Consequently, everyone that would-offer acceptable prayer to Jehovah God today must do so in the .name of Jesus Christ. If we obey the divine instructions as to this vital matter, our prayer to God will be acceptable to Him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;">Gilead’s Eleventh Class Graduates</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">T</span><span class="font16">HE rising sun arced higher into the heavens. Hours ago this created “light to rule the day” had rendered invisible the stars that had crowded the night sky, and by now had chased the chill from the earth with its warming rays. By nine o’clock on this glorious morning of August 1 it had drunk the last of the morning dew from the grassy lawns that sloped lazily down from Shiloah to halt at the edge of the shaded pool cupped in the earth’s bosom.. Thence the millions of grassy blades encircle the pond and climb the hill beyond to carpet in green other beauty spots of Gilead’s rolling campus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But our interest on this morning of August 1 does not wander from the sunny greens that stretch from Shiloah to theshaded pool. Thousands of men, women and children have assembled on the lawn, some seated in orderly rows of folding chairs, others comfortably situated on the grass. All expectantly face Shiloah, the rusticly modern library of Gilead, for there Mr. N. H. Knorr, president of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead, has taken up position in front of the microphone that will carry to the thousands of hearing ears the proceedings of the graduation exercises of the eleventh class of this school for advanced ministers of the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The three-hour program that follows is as delightful as its beautiful setting. Thankful prayer to God sets events in motion, and the proceedings gain momentum as the president touches on the uniqueness of this eleventh class of 108 graduates. They hailed from 16 different nations, making it Gilead’s second international class. The total of their full-time service records as ministers prior to attending Gilead mounts to more than 1,000 years. An average of nearly 10 years each. In fulfillment of Christ’s prediction that His followers would suffer persecution and imprisonment, the combined group’s time spent in jail for gospel-preaching totaled 30 years. Also different for this class was the teaching of Japanese to 22 students; the others studied French. All of those studying Japanese will go to Japan as missionaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Next in order come friendly words of counsel to the graduates from the Kingdom Farm servant and the four school instructors, to be followed by the reading of telegrams from countries on the continents of North America, South America, Africa, Asia, Europe and Australia, and from the isles of the seas. The secretary-treasurer of the Watchtower Society spoke to the class, and brought the program to the scheduled discourse of the school’s president. He chose to speak to these specially trained ministers that will be sent .to far corners of the earth on the subject of “Ministers at the World’s End”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The theme emphasized and re-empha-sized was that the light must shine at this world’s end. &quot;What light? That emanating from Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, which must be caught by ministers and reflected throughout the earth. From its past service record the eleventh class has already done much shining, but it will take on greater brilliance as a result of its Gilead training and shed Bible light in hitherto dark parts of the globe. Their pay for letting the gospel light shine </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font16"> The privileges of serving as God’s ministers and sharing in Jehovah’s vindication, Such godliness with contentment will bring them great gain. Quite different from the high salaries drawn by Christendom’s orthodox clergy. The persecution and imprisonment&quot; these graduates experience is in sharp contrast with the honor and position of the world’s priests and preachers. But .so also is the reward that awaits Jehovah’s faithful witnesses in the New World. Hence, with strength from above they stick to their ministerial work, contending for the faith, using their training to advance and expand </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">their</span><span class="font16"> ministry and keep it blameless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">As Mr. Knorr called out the names of the graduates-they came forward to receive envelopes containing gifts from the Society and diplomas. Encouraging applause from the observing audience greeted each one as he received this </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">envelope that climaxed</span><span class="font16"> and ended the five-month period of intensive training. On the heels of this distribution a member of the student body read a letter addressed to the president, which contained a resolution by the class expressing their determination to use the instruction in order to show their appreciation for having freely received it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">During this three-hour program that</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">- was now closing with some announcements many wondered and speculated as to the number in attendance, but when President Knorr announced that there were 3,559 persons present the &quot;oh’s” and “ah’s” of the audience and the quick applause that followed showed just how happily surprised they were. At the outset of the proceedings the school chorus had sung Jehovah’s witnesses marching song, composed by one spending many years in a Nazi concentration camp because of his faithfulness and steadfastness. Now the chorus once more filled the garden park with the vibrant feeling of the unquenchable faith and zeal of Jehovah’s ministers,.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Prayer by Mr. Knorr closed the exercises, and </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font16"> closes this report with its best wishes for godly success to the eleventh class. May its members always let their gospel </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">light</span><span class="font16"> shine.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Kremlin Talks</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the effort to make a new approach to the East-West conflict the Western powers on August 1 had their representatives separately call on Russia’s foreign minister Molotov in Moscow to make arrangements for a meeting with Premier Stalin* Arrangements were accordingly made and the following Monday evening Bedell Smith lor the ILS., Yves Chataigneau for France, and Frank Roberts for Britain went to the Kremlin, conferring with Stalin for more than two hours. They emerged smiling* The subjects brought up at this meeting were not disclosed, but there was a marked easing of tension in the East-West situation and further talks were in prospect. August 6 the Western envoys had a meeting with Molotov, which continued for three hours, and yielded the following statement from Ambassador Smith, <sup>1</sup>'Three hours, Molotov, no Stalin, no comment”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Further meetings with Molotov followed August 9 and 12* The negotiations had not dispelled the perplexity of the powers, and Ambassador Smith said, “We are still without any conclusions/* The Issues involved centered around the Berlin blockade and the intention of the Western powers to set up a German state in their zones Independent of the course taken in the Soviet zone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Beautiful 'Bed’ Danube</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&lt;$&gt; The conference on the Danube in progress at Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in early August, was seeking to draft a plan for control of shipping on the important eastern European waterway. Before the war the river was administered by an international commission composed of Britain, France and the nations situated along the course of the river. The Big Four had agreed a year and a half ago to continue the principle of “free and equal navigation” and “international control&quot; of the Danube- At the conference Russia and the U. S. submitted their respective plans for carrying out the stated objectives. Ac^ cording to the Russian plan Austria would not be included in the “control commission&quot; until after the signing of a peace treaty. The other nations.on the Danube would constitute the commission. No provision was made for Germany, also a riparian country, now or in the future. Britain, France and the U. S. were excluded. The American plan proposed guarantees for navigation companies of all nations. The beautiful blue Danube is to be exclusively “Red&quot;.</span></p>

The teachers and some other Russians were to return to Russia. One of the teachers, Mrs* Oksana Stepanova Kosenkina appears to have been reluctant about going back to her native land. She was in touch with White Russians, who do not like the “Reds&quot; </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">even </span><span class="font1">a little bit. Arrangements </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font1">made for the teacher to stay with her new-found friends* “Reds&quot; said she was drugged to go along with them to the Tolstoy Foundation’s Reed farm. The Russian Consulate went there and brought Mrs. Kosenkina back to the Consulate in New York, where they felt she belonged* Countess Tolstoy, in charge of the Reed farm, said that when Mrs* Kosenkina saw the Red Russians coming, she turned white. Rockland County police were told </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font1">teacher had been abducted to get her back to the Consulate* </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">There </span><span class="font1">she didn’t know just what to </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">do, </span><span class="font1">and decided after a few days to jump out of the third-story window, which appears to Indicate she was not free to leave by a door, or a window on a lower floor, which would have been more convenient, Molotov, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">who </span><span class="font1">was not there, Issued an official statement that Mrs, Kosenkina fell out of the window* Meanwhile, the Consulate being in the U.

Russian official^ - issued many protests, but to no avail* Another teacher, Samarin<sub>t </sub>with his family, also refused to return to Russia, and obtained IL 8- sanctuary. In Russia it was reported that Mrs* Kosenkina and Mr* Samarin and family had been “kidnaped” by the U. S* But It was not explained that they were glad to be “kidnaped&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Congressional Investigations</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&lt;$&gt; Testimony concerning alleged Communist espionage in the IL 8* continued to occupy the attention </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">of the Congressional investigation committees in early August.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A dramatic</span><span class="font1"> note entered the proceedings when Miss Elizabeth T* Bentley, who said she had acted as a Communist agent during the late war, appeared before the House committee* She accused </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">high </span><span class="font1">government officials of passing out information that was relayed to Russia, Including information about the atomic bomb, Louis F. Budenz, former Communist party leader, declared that,there were many Russian spy rings in this country, and </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font1">there were perhaps thou</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">sands </span><span class="font1">of Communists in government jobs. Another witness, Whittaker Chambers, who was a Communist from 1924 to 1937, said that Alger Hiss, former director of special political affairs in the State department, was a leader in the Communist setup in the U. 8. He is president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, in New York. A brother of Hiss, and other men of note, were likewise accused of being Com* munlat backers. </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font1">Hiss brothers emphatically denied the charges being made against them. </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font1">Communist party at its convention referred to the investigations as a &quot;circus”. Author Louis Adamic, also accused of Communist activity, said, &quot;It cannot be doubted that the whole fantastic spy scare is mainly motivated to smear Wallace by smearing his supporters*”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">‘‘Voice of America*’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The “Voice of America” in early August started to operate in England five additional high-powered transmitters that double the number of Voice signals relayed into Russia and satellite countries. Accurate news is the foundation of the programs, which alm to avoid distortion, name-calling and fabrication in </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">reaching a </span><span class="font1">potential audience of </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">many </span><span class="font1">millions behind the &quot;iron curtain*’* </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font1">Voice is being beamed to every important part </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font1">the'world, and its programs total 26½ hours a day* Reports from abroad show it is widely heard* The programs are broadcast in 22 languages and include also musical features.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Communist Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Wm* Z. Foster, national chairman of the Communist party in the U. S. and one of the twelve Communists under Indictment for conspiracy to overthrow the government, announced August 2 that the Communist party endorsed and would work for the election of Henry A, Wallace as president* The announcement was made at the opening of the national convention of the party* An application by Earl Browder, many years the spokesman of American Communism, for readmission to the party was rejected with the statement that “the request for re-admission was in Itself a disguised form of anti-party activity”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Congress Labors</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&lt;$&gt; Called to a special session by the president, the U. S. Congress In early August labored at appearing to be busy* The program presented by the president for its attention included measures for rationing, price control, allocations, credit and rent controls, an excess profits, tax, housing, education, minimum wages, social security, displaced persons legislation, the United Nations loan, and civil rights. It was quite a program for a special session* The Republican Congress, however, suspect of the president's motives, had no intention of exhausting Itself to carry out the program of the Democratic president. Looking around for something to take up the time, they decided to start with the poll-tax measure. Southern Democrats proceeded at once to filibuster* On August 2 the Republicans decided they should appear to be doing something to stop the filibustering, which they really did not mind much* The sham battle was lost, and the poll-tax measure was put aside. The Congress then acted on the $65,000,-000 U, N. loan, and passed it in the House 164-27, the Senate having approved It last April* </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font1">president signed the bill on August 11 Then action was taken on credit controls *as an antb inflation measure and on housing to provide loans for the building of low-cost private homes and apartments. Provisions for slum clearance and public housing were dropped* President Truman signed the housing bill and denounced it at the same time. ‘The Congressional mountain had labored, brought forth a mouse/ and quickly adjourned*</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Impeachment Threat</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Homer Ferguson, of Michigan, on August </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">7</span><span class="font1"> declared fn a speech in the U. S. Senate that &quot;Congress is rapidly being pushed into the Intolerable position of having either to legislate through a blind spot or compel the president to answer for his conduct in an impeachment proceeding”. He denounced Truman for refusing to turn over to the Congressional investigators of alleged Red espionage the loyalty files on certain Federal employees. Senator Hoey, of North Carolina, the next day referred to Ferguson’s speech </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">as</span><span class="font1"> a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">political tirade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Indians Have Bight to Vote</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A special three-judge Federal court at Santa Fe, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">N. Mex., ruled, </span><span class="font1">on August 3, that a New Mexico constitutional provision denying Indians the right to vote was contrary to the </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">U, S, </span><span class="font1">Constitution* The decision in effect gives the New Mexico Indians the privilege of voting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Clergymen Mourn</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A group of over a hundred clergymen through the National Council Against Conscription, issued an appeal (August 8) that the Sunday before the beginning of the peacetime draft be observed as a &quot;day of mourning and repentance<sup>1</sup>* in protest over the new draft law. The clergymen said that the youth should be told of their obligation not to give &quot;unquestioning obedience to secular authority” but to reason for Itself, and that the provisions tor conscientious objectors under the law be put before them together with assurance of church backing from those who followed the dictates of their conscience. The clergy can always strike a nice pacifist pose—when </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">there is</span><span class="font1"> no war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Surplus Grain</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">«$&gt; According to a Department of Agriculture report (August 1), the U. S. will have a carry-over of more than a billion bushels of the major grain crops this year. Meanwhile the unfavorable weather of Europe in recent months has blighted crops there, and there is still an over-all shortage, and, since world population has never increased at anything like the present rate, the question of feeding humanity remains a problem. The earth’s present population Is set at 2,250,-000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Palestine Trace</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Palestine truce observers have been described as being like newspaper reporters sitting around waiting for a good four-alarm fire. Whenever there was a flare-up in Palestine (and there were many), the observers hurried to the scene to see what they could of the fighting and try to determine who were at fault, Jews or Arabs. In the first half of August the truce seemed to be forking out fairly well, but there were many small skirmishes, both in Jerusalem and elsewhere. Shots rang out all too frequently. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Toward</span><span class="font1"> mid-August the Palestine Jewish government declared that unless the U. N. compelled the withdrawal of the Arab armies, th£ Jews -would have to do it by war, and so bring the truce to an end.</span></p>
