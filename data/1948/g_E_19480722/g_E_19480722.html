<p><span class="font12">SPIRITUAL FAMINE IN CHRISTENDOM</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Behold, the days come, sal th the Lord Jehovah, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst* for water, but of hearing the words of Jehovah/'—Amos 8:11, Am, Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19480722_files/g_E_19480722-3.png" alt="" style="width:55pt;height:54pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">“MAN shall not live by bread alone,” said Christ Jesus. In these trying days of food shortages and famine some of hasty spirit may retort, “But millions are dying without it.” Sober reflections bring understanding of Jesus’ words. Bread alone keeps no man alive. Time inexorably draws all into the grave. Those filled with bread still march toward death unless they heed the followup words of Jesus: “But by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” (Matthew 4:4) Bread may push death farther into the future, but itjs only a matter of short time till faltering steps stumble their way into the grave. Victory over death comes only to those whose steps are guided by “every &quot;word, that proceedeth out of the mouth of God”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hence the vital need is for an unfailing supply of spiritual food. Where is it to be found? In Christendom? By the name she assumes, one would think so. By the plenty of Bibles circulating there, one would be reassured. By the hundreds of sects and cults that thrive within her boundaries, one would anticipate full freedom from want of spiritual food. But are the spiritually hungry filled to satisfaction by the religious fodder dished up by Christendom ? Do her hun-</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">JULY 22, 1948</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">dreds of churches provide wheat m chaff, corn or husks? Is there spiritua famine in Christendom? The international leader of the Salvation Army recently said: “The spiritual hunger foi hope and faith in Europe is greater that hunger for food.” But no need to limi! the verdict to Europe. No more than s glance into Christendom’s cupboard is needed to show that her cupboard is bar« of spiritual food.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>“To Be Seen of Men”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">But in that cupboard she has abundant stores of folly, For instance, the Greek Orthodox Church has a Feast of the Epiphany, a part of which is diving for a cross thrown into icy water. On January 25, 1948, the crucifix was thrown into the ice-choked waters of the Hudson, at New York city, by Archbishop Sgltas. Four Greek swimmers tried in vain to retrieve it. The folly appears, not in the fact that the feast is held at the wrong time of the year to celebrate Jesus’ baptism by John, nor because the crucifix is stuck in a muddy river bottom, nor because men jeopardize health and life trying to retrieve it, but by the archbishop’s statement after failure to recover the cross. He said the ceremony had “no particular meaning”, had “no</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">special significance’<sup>1</sup>. Then why do it? ' Folly is found in the ritual of Roman Catholic churches, such as,recent newspaper photographs of priests blessing horses to “render the animals immune to disease and<sup>-</sup>prevent their causing injury to human beings”. Not only animals, but inanimate machines are blessed; notable among which were the war </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">weapons of Hitler</span><span class="font7"> and Mussolini that were blessed by Cathode priests. Also, the mass production and blessing of medals feed only credulity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Protestantism displays just as much folly, seeking to be spectacular, “to be seen of men,” “to catch the notice of men.” (Matthew 23:5; </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt}</span><span class="font7"> For instance, the “Reverend” William Hains-worth, of Michigan, a Congregational minister, advertised himself when, in a spirit of showmanship, he toured several states literally preaching from housetops. He made a mockery of Jesus’ words counseling that wide and open publicity be given the gospel message.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19480722_files/g_E_19480722-4.png" alt="" style="width:54pt;height:54pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">In a similar category was the Texas revival campaign of the “famous cow girl evangelist” Bessie Brufifett. It was advertised as a “heavenly round-up”, and the advance fanfare urged attendance, not because of any Scriptural qualifications, but because she was af beauty contest winner and had been groomed for a movie career. The large picture shows her exhibiting her horsemanship on a Tearing white steed, and she is gaudily attired in the togs of a rodeo cow girl. She was “converted” to this life by mother’s prayers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the expense of respect for the Bible and the Christian ministry, a sevenyear-old “child wonder preacher” from America brought the “hot gospel” to England. She is Renee Martz. Her father, a graduate from the Baptist seminary, toots the trombone while her mother blows the sax, and a fourth member of the troupe tickles the ivories. They arrived in England on an around-' me-world tour and claimed to have “jived” the Scriptures to thousands. Renee’s sermon is the typical' chaff of emotional revivalism., and runs somewhat as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What we need is a revival. If we don’t have a revival people are going to perish for their sins. Every one must pray for a revival. Then the Iford will give you everything you want The churches of America .are so dead I hate to peek into them. I would rather have a revival in my mind and a hallelujah in my heart than sit in a church looking like that. And when people have a great revival, they don’t smoke any more, they don’t gamble any more, they don’t go to theaters any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Renee’s father, like his daughter, wears cowboy outfits. With revivalists indulging in so much theatrics there could be no need for their followers’ go^ ing to theaters any more. “Reverend” Martz, senior, boasted of the converts his daughter makes; but apparently they are not his chief interest, as he said the ‘‘hot gospel” team would leaye London to return to the northern part of England because they were more of a financial success up there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Colliers,</span><span class="font7"> February 7, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">informs that </span><span class="font7">“simple tricks of magic are now used by some 200 American ministers to emphasize points in talks to their Sunday school and Bible classes. One trick, for example, is the passing of a handkerchief through a tube marked &quot;Church’ which changes its color from black to white and illustrates symbolically how a blackened soul *may be cleansed of its sins. The clergymen are organized in a 'society, the Magi-Ministers, and exchange ideas in a column of their own in a magic magazine”. The caption under the picture of a Massachusetts minister, garbed and painted as a clown, states: “It’s fun to be fooled when the Rev. Thomas Call of Swampscott, magician and clergyman, is providing the deception.” Many clergymen in Christendom provide deception, even' concerning the Scriptures, find some day persons will awake to realize it is hot fun to be tooled by such religious folly. They will discover that they are spiritually famished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Seeking attention at any cost is the “Reverend” Charles Bullock, Methodist minister in South Dakota. He was adjudged champion liar upon winning an annual sportsman’s liar contest, and his certificate award declared that he is “a full-fledged liar entitled to every courtesy from liars everywhere and an honorary member of our club for life”. The story he told to win the contest was only a figment of the imagination, but the same can be said for Methodist teachings concerning “trinity”, “eternal torment in hell-fire,” and “inherent immortality of the human soul”. This is not the first time clergymen have been adjudged champion liars, for Jesus said to the religious leaders of His day: “Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. . . . When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.” —John 8:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mention of the lie concerning eternal torment reminds of the title advertised for a sermon to be delivered to the Baptist congregation in Kirksville, Mo., which read: “Why Three-Fourths of the Kirksville Baptists Ought to Go to Hell.” The folly displayed in sermon titles is well known, ranging from absurdities to political meddling. For instance, when the senseless song entitled “Open the Door, Richard” was the rage the “Reverend” Richard Billingsley, of Middletown, N. Y., feared the song was getting more attention than he was; so he sought to cut in on at least some reflected “glory” by titling one of his sermons “Open the Door, Richard”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Los Angeles religious folly partakes of commercialism and high-pres-surism. Several churches sponsor spot announcements over the radio, every hour on the hour. Some revivalists&quot;own their stations and pour out their preachments all day long. For example, there are Mster Bessie and Bister Alice, who take turns in emotional outbursts imploring God for special favors for their parishioners. Then Brother Alfred interrupts occasionally to offer praise to God on his trombone. Next, Sister Mary chimes in with her respects to the Almighty by warbling some bird calls. The unending flood of greedy and selfish re-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">7quests to God to do this and do that finally provoked I lolly-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A <sup>wo</sup>°d columnist Jim Marshall to pen a letter, which said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font6">was a-sittin’ by my raddio Sunday listenin’ to the preachers a-beflerin’ and a-whinin’ to God A’mighty to give ’em this, that and t’other thing, and hurry up! Some was demandin’ more dough, some wanted a-showerin’ </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">down </span><span class="font6">of more holy spirit &quot;and all of them was after everything from fewer buttons in the collection plate to eternal life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A few preachers was demandin’ God heal gall bladder trouble and asthma, and one minister was a-eallin’ on God to stop some kid’s diarrhea right away so his mother could get a minute’s peace. Another minister was demandin’ God Jay off everything and disappear a tumor that had been aggravatin’ a parishioner for nigh onto 12 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Marshall’s conclusion was that a Give-God-a-Break Movement should be organized, that He should have some peace from the preachers that make “God’s life miserable by a-whoopin’ and a-hol-lerin’ for help every 10 minutes”.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>“Den of Thieves”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Such religious folly does twofold harm. It belittles and makes ridiculous in appearance God’s Word and His ministry, sin&lt;;e these preachers claim to be representing God in their foolish antics. Also, it harms in that it poses as spiritual food yet fails to relieve the spiritual famine in Christendom. Nor do religion’s famishing ways end with such folly. When Jesus was on earth He'drove money-changers from the temple and condemned them for making God’s house a “den of thieves”. (Matthew 21:13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Christendom's churches could also be labeled a &quot;den of thieves”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Typical of the bingoitis and gambling mania infecting the churches, particularly the Boman Catholic ch-qrches, were recent activities in Milwaukee, Wis. In its August 18, 1947, issue the Milwaukee </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font7"> revealed how the Little Flower Roman Catholic church netted $1,500 at a picnic. In the big tent across the street from the church </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">forty</span><span class="font7"> chuck-a-luck games operated. Chuck-a-luck is a dice game that lifts your money with the ease of a professional pickpocket. Also in the tent were gaming wheels, crap tables, dart games, card games and other gambling pastimes where the player had everything to lose and practically nothing to gain. Young high-school girls ran the ehuck-a-luck games. This game is patterned after the “26 game” of professional gambling houses; except that the professional gambling-house game is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">6-to-5 in</span><span class="font7"> favor of the house, whereas the Catholic-church version is almost 2-to-l in favor of the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The money of children is good, hence acceptable to the church. Some of the child-gamblers were so small they could barely push up their </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">noses to the level of</span><span class="font7"> the gaming tables. Knowing nothing of the percentages that operate against the player,,the younger set groaned un-philosophically as wheel or dice ate up their spending money. The happy face of a youthful winner was a rare sight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the reporter of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Journal </span><span class="font7">looked up “Father” Joseph De Maria, pastor of the Little Flower church, and asked whether he had to get permission from the authorities to run the illegal gambling, the priest said; </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“No. They</span><span class="font7"> tolerate these games, they tolerate them for the church.” When asked -whether he did not fear the youngsters would pick up bad habits the priest replied: &quot;Of course not, my son. These few pennies, it’s just like they were playing in their own homes.” But the “few pennies” totaled $1,500 for the church, which religious</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;fathers” extracted from their &quot;children”. Hardly like playing at home, where fleshly fathers do not take back their children’s spending money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">. On September 8 the Journal published </span><span class="font7">pictures of gambling on the parish grounds of the Holy Redeemer Catholic church, showing children, just big enough to stand at the tables, rolling djce. Anyone big enough to hold the dice box was big enough to tangle with “Lady Luck”. As the young rolled out the dice the church rolled up profits. On the 15th of that month the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font7"> publicized the gambling at two more churches: the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary church and St. Mary’s church, both in the Milwaukee vicinity. At one of these gambling dens churchmen hid gaming devices when deputies approached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The various priests and bish-’ °P<sup>S</sup> involved generally refused to talk, but one did defend the dIB </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">71 </span><span class="font7">gambling by saying: “We raffle a few articles by means of which our people derive pleasure.” One of the signs of the “last days” is that the people love pleasures more than they love God. Another is that religious leaders and their congregations have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof. Both of these foretold signs are in evidence in the churches. And to the priest who justifies gambling on the grounds of pleasure we might ask: Does pleasure derived </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">justify adultery? drunkenness? </span><span class="font7">looting? or other sins and immoralities?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Milwaukee's police chief, Polcyn, deplored the church gambling not only because it violated the law but also because “it tended to acquaint children with gambling. Showing children how to gamble just makes more trouble for the police department 10 or 15 years from now. It’s a bad business no matter how you look at it”. Editorially, the Milwaukee </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font7"> hit hard at this “education in law violation supervised by” the churches, and, after mentioning church concern over “juvenile delinquency and adult crime&quot; and preacmng an out ooeervmg the laws of God and man, asked:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How can it square its preaching with its behavior, when it seeks revenue from illegal sources, from activities which may undermine character and do lend the cloak of respectability to the commercial gambling that pauperizes families and, because of the easy money involved, has often led to gang warfare, police corruption and worse? How can the church, indeed, blame people for a growing disinterest in religion itself, when, instead of leading in moral niceties and law observance, it panders to the gambling instincts' latent in all in order to make the financing of its holy work easier and less burdensome ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An odd remedy for gambling was proposed by the religious leaders of Steubenville, Ohio. Their folly was reported in the Cleveland </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Press,</span><span class="font7"> November 1, 1946, which headlined across the front page: “Give Us Guns, Pastors Demand, to End Steubenville Crime.&quot; “Make tfs policemen and give us guns and we’ll clean up this city of vice, crime, gambling and corruption,” pastors, in Steubenville demanded. A local crime wave touched off this showy blast, and the pious pastors clamored that they and twenty war veterans be deputized as a “vice squad to go out and bring in the gamblers and cheaters”. Ah! would it not be a most astounding sight to see this posse of pistol-packing parsons rounding up and bringing in Hie “reverend” bingo-gamblers from the divers and sundry church houses? Or would expediency demand that they wink at this “holy gambling”? However, it-may all work out profitably for the pious “vice squad”, both in publicity and in money.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Teaching for Doctrines</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the Commandments of Men”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When we look at Christendom’s doctrines we see how very bare of spiritual iooa ner cupooara is. one nas aesxroyea the food supply by destroying respect for the Bible. Modernists look upon the Scriptures as mere myth. Harry Emerson Fosdick, prominent retired clergyman, boasted of not believing in the ransom sacrifice, and added: “I do not know any intelligent Christian minister who does.” Bishop Barnes, -of the Church of England, typified the science-worshipers df today when he wrote: “Belief in miracles has gone from the scientific world.” Many of the seminaries that hatch the modern broods of ministers teach evolution. Assailing the Federal Council of Churches, as the “citadel of modernist denials of God’s Word”, the fundamentalist Dr. Van Gilder said: “It is shocking when the leaders of the largest and most powerful Protestant council in America peddle a brand of infidelity as hostile to the Bible as anything Tom Paine or Bob Ingersoll ever voiced.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But when the spiritually hungry turn from Modernism to Fundamentalism, are they filled with strengthening food? No. First, many sects destroy three-fourths of the Bible by saying the “Old Testament” no longer applies and is not necessary for Christians. The Catholic Church .deletes from God’s Word the 'Second Commandment forbidding images, by leaving it out of their catechisms listing the “Ten Commandments”. To hide the deletion, they divide the Tenth Commandment into two, to make a total of ten. Moreover, they add to God’s Word several apocryphal books. -Deuteronomy4:2; Revelation 22:18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">However, adding to and subtracting from God’s Word are only beginnings for Christendom’s clergy. As Jesus said to the religious leaders, they are “teaching for doctrines the commandments of men” and they make “the commandment of God of none effect” by their tradition. (Matthew 15:3,6-9) The Scriptures clearly teach that men should not be given flattering titles, such as “Reverend” and “Rabbi’' and &quot;Father”; that all men are fallible; that God and Christ are separate individuals; that man has no immortal soul; that there is np torment in a fiery hell or purgatory; that the earth will not go up in smoke, but is to abide forever.—For abundant Bible proof see the Watchtower publication </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bather than teach these Bible truths, the fundamentalist clergy teach traditions about hell-fire and purgatorial torments, three-in-one God or “trinity”, immortality of the human soul, prayers for suffering souls in torment, papal infallibility, and bestow many fluttering titles upon each other. These practices and teachings are traced by encyclopedias and other historical works back to paganism of long ago. In view of this, the criticism of “Father” White at the army and navy chaplains conference in New York city, May 10, that many commissioned officers were “pagan and immoral” is a boomerang.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Creature-worship is another failing of religion that eliminates it as a provider of spiritual food. The pope of Rome claims to be as God. The priests claim power to bring God down and sacrifice Him on their church altars. Concerning priests the Wayne </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Independent,</span><span class="font7"> June 3, 1947, said: “God has created him a little </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">more</span><span class="font7"> than the angels.” This is a take-off of the scripture about Jesus as a man on earth, only the scripture says God made the man Jesus a little </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">lower</span><span class="font7"> than the angels. Thereby the priest is hoisted higher than Jesus and the angels. More arrogant belittling conies from “Father” Feeney, of Massachusetts, when he declared that Christianity is “primarily and centrally the love of God as a baby”. He claims that the crucial question to be propounded sinners at God’s judgment seat will be: “What did you think of me as a child?” Christendom’s blasphemy-mounts.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>&quot;They Are Greedy Uogs&quot;</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s prophet Isaiah said that under inspiration about false shepherds. Do facts in Christendom make it applicable now? Let us see. Every church member and attender knows the fervent zeal with which the collection plate is passed and repassed, and the needs of money for this and money for that that constantly arise. “Father” O’Bryan, of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Somerset, Ky., even bragged one time concerning his extrac-tion of money from his parish-&lt;A^jlioners: “I have bled them white.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A lucrative source of revenue is the “purgatory” doctrine, with its companion doctrine of “prayers for the dead”. A Catholic leaflet described &quot;purgatory” thus: “It is a spiritual laundry where souls are cleansed and made perfectly ready for the vision of their God.” This same folder contained an article entitled “Cry from Purgatory”, which, started out: “I died at 11:15 last night! Today I ant alive in purgatory!... I am buried in an ocean of fire, searing and tormenting yet not consuming or destroying.” After many excruciating tortures .described and heart-rending cribs addressed to his surviving family, the sufferer implores the living loved ones: “Every little act of sacrifice offered for me dull the intensity of the flames that are forever torturing me. . . . Offer the holy sacrifice of the mass for my imprisoned soul!” And the saying of masses or prayers for the dead costs money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hence the priests not only make God out to be a fiendish torturer, but also picture Him as a receiver of bribes of filthy lucre, in return for spiritual blessings or mercy. They have thereby turned many honest persons away from God. They know “purgatory” is not once mentioned in the Bible. It is an ancient pagan doctrine. The heads of the Roman Catholic Church know this, and admit that the Catholic Church does “transmute the very instruments and append-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ages of demon-worship to an evangelical use”. They justify these paganisms on the ground that they are “sanctified by their adoption into the Church”.—Cardinal Newman, in his </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine,</span><span class="font6"> pages 355, 371, 373.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now brace yourself to hear the very pinnacle of blasphemy for money reward. It comes from the Catholic province of Quebec, Canada. It is a first mortgage on the kingdom of heaven. Printed in legal-looking dress, the mortgage has attached several leaves of coupons that require 25-cent remittances weekly, for fifty-two weeks. While paying in this $13 for the year, the payee supposedly receives spiritual benefits, not described.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The bond purports to come from the Dominion of Heaven, Province of Charity. Its name is First Mortgage Bond on the Kingdom of Heaven, the Community of the Reverend Jesuit Fathers of Villa Manrese. The corporation’s business office is supposedly at Villa Manrese, incorporated by a statute of Paradise, and promises a hundredfold return to the holder of the bond. Its issue is “$100,000 at 100-percent interest redeemable at the Bank of Heaven”. It promises that on the first day of eternity the “Eternal Father, Head Trustee of the Popular 'Savings Bank of Paradise, promises to pay to the holder of this bond” the sum of $13 in “legal tender of Paradise bearing interest eternally”. The bond is issued by “an assumed law adopted by the Board of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, at the Good Works deposit bureau, and is guaranteed by Saint Yves, the patron saint of lawyers”. The Jesuits issuing this bond say that they have caused it to be signed by “the Eternal Father, Head Trustee of all spiritual credit, and by Saint Peter, Manager, assisted by Saint Matthew, accountant and income tax collector”. At the end are signatures of “Father” Pare and “Senator” Vaillancourt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Though the brain be racked, no words can be found to describe this bold and brazen blasphemy. This fabulously rich religious organization has gobbled up many of the choice spots on earth; now it extends its real estate activities into heaven. Psalm 115:16 states: “The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord’s : but the earth hath he given to the children of men.” However, these cunning Jesuits presume to oust God from His heavenly habitation and take over ownership thereof. They claim to have title to heaven and the right to issue mortgages on the realm of heaven, for which they receive the money, but whose repayment must be made by God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Surely it is as the prophet Micah said: “The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the Lord, and say, Is not the Lord among us ? none evil can come upon .us.” (3:11) Yes, it is even as the prophet Isaiah said: “They are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber. Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.” (56:10,11) And certainly it is as the apostle Paul bluntly put it, at 1 Timothy 6:5 (Knox Catholic Translation): “Religion, they think, will provide them with a living.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Ye Are of This World”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. Jesus said: “My kingdom is not of this world.” No Christian “entangleth himself with the affairs of this life”. (John 18:36; 8:23; 2 Timothy 2:3,4) But Pope Pius XII said, on March 16, 1946: “The separation of religion and life, the church and the world is contrary to the Christian and Catholic idea.” Pope Pius XI said: “The pope . . . must deal even with the devil.” (May issue of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">’48) </span><span class="font6">He said this to justify his dealings with the Axis dictators. These papal pro-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">iwunceinents are only typical of the political character of the majority of the churches of Christendom, The churches believe they must convert the world. As the “Lord Bishop” of London, Wand, put it, to make the world “become a little more like the kingdom of heaven”. But Jesus practiced no such polities, and the p'olitiealism of Christendom’s churches only heightens spiritual famine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The clergy are useful to the political leaders of this world. They keep the people docile under misrule, saying the politicians, and not Jehovah and Christ, are the 'higher powers” of Romans 13: 1 to whom every soul must be subject. This deliberate scripture wresting leads to absurdity in wartime. The “higher powers” in one land fight against the “higher powers” in another land, and Christians must be subject to both, yet the “higher powers” themselves bring civil war to God’s organization according to the clergy reasoning. Actually, the clergy are as weathercocks that swing into line with every wind of public opinion._ In wartime they are for war; in peacetime their oratory against war bursts into full bloom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Prior to World War II the Baptists opposed war. During the war they conveniently discovered, “God has a stake in this w<sup>T</sup>ar.” The same situation obtained with the Methodists, and now that the war is over and peace hysteria has supplanted war hysteria, the Methodists can again be righteously indignant with war. Hence the general conference of the Methodist church, on' May 7, denounced the “sinfulness of war”, declared that “Christianity and war are utterly opposed”, that the church must “not become the agent of any government for its furtherance”, and that the task of the church was healing and that hence it could not become “a partisan in international conflict and destruction”. From England comes an April dispatch that the Church of England commission has justified the use of atomic bombs. As for* the Catholic Church on atomic warfare, on May 1 “Father” Barrett, a Jesuit and former army chaplain, gave the Virgin Mary a new title, namely, “Our Lady of the Atom.” Jehovah God says, “I change not.” And of Christ it says, “Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.” (Malachi 3:6; Hebrews 13:8) But the clergy of Christendom are 'unstable, double-minded and wavering, like a wave of the sea driven and slapped and tossed by the changing wind’.—James 1; 6-8.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Communism is the pet crusade-theme for the churches today. '“Reverend” Fifield, of Brooklyn, declared recently: “One of the reasons for the gains of Communism is the weakening of the church and the weakening of the hold of spiritual strength on the lives of the people.” And to note the titles of his sermons week by week gives explanation for the spiritual weakness of the people. Between worldly book reviews and political “sermons”, no room remains for spiritual food on the menu.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To be truthful, religion has done more to turn the people away from God than Communism ever has. Religion itself has become materialistic, a doubter of the Bible, a worshiper of science, a worker of folly, and a grasper for money and political power. Religion has turned its back on God’s Word and starved the people spiritually. During May the Federal Council of Churches in a peace program quoted Stalin as saying Communism struck when opposing forces had “exposed their practical bankruptcy”. Religion is supposed to be the opposing force, and it certainly has exposed its bankruptcy and failed to spiritually strengthen the people to withstand the onslaught of atheistic Communism. Reporting on the spread of Coiqmunism in Latin America, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Latin American News Letter,</span><span class="font7"> No, 26, February, 1948, said: “It has filled the vacuum caused by the failure of established religion.” Communism thrives on spiritual famine, not physical famine; and religion must bear responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“By Thy Words Thou Shalt</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Be Condemned?*</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Even the clergy themselves admit the failure of their churches. Lutheran minister Stoughton, of New York city, declared, on January 18, that whbn church members fail to do God’s work the &quot;church becomes no better than a social club”. On May 24 &quot;Reverend” Keegan, prominent Baptist, lamented the modern church’s substitution of &quot;ritual for righteousness”, bemoaned the fact that &quot;we [clergymen] have dared to set aside Christ’s counsels for our conveniences” and that mankind are as “scattered sheep without a shepherd”, and hit at the clergy’s practice of orating on far-flung world affairs while the spiritual needs of the local congregations were forgotten. One day later, at the Northern Baptist convention Dr. Dahlberg told the 5,000 delegates that the churches must &quot;cease being just a bunch of fiddles, flutes, trumpets and drums tuning up continuously and competitively in a program of discord”. And next day “Reverend” Rutenberl told the convention: “What we have called Christianity in this country is an uneasy amalgam of Christian faith, profoundly mixed with worldly ideas and secular ideals.” The retired minister Harry Emerson Fos-dick wrote in the April, 1947, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Ladies' Home Journal:</span><span class="font7"> “The world is certainly a mess, and whether or not we like to face the fact, religion helps to make it so.” When Minister Leon C. Burns lec-tured at War Memorial Auditorium, Nashville, Tenn., on May 19, 1946, he placed the blame for Christendom’s apostasy where it belonged. He said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The church, that once was a mighty bulwark against sin and crime of every sort, has lost its appeal to the people. . . . There was a time when the members of the church, by the very lives they lived, constituted an in</span><span class="font7">fluence for good, but this is no longer true; </span><span class="font6">for the simple reason that the </span><span class="font7">man </span><span class="font6">of the world can visit almost any church and find members, and even leaders of the church, who are guilty of almost every crime in the catalog. Preachers no longer cry from their pulpits against divorce ' and adultery, because when they do they realize they must look into the faces of mkny of their best-paying members who are guilty of these sins. The greater responsibility for such conditions in the churches must be placed at the feet of the preachers. . . . Too many of them are inter-ested in holding a job rather than in preaching the truth of God. Money and the desire to be popular rule the pulpit, and hence the Devil has taken his place in the front pew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So be it. It is as Christ Jesus declared: “Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee.” Or again: “By thy words thou shalt be condemned.” (Luke 19:22; Matthew 12:37) By their own words and acts Christendom’s clergy have convicted themselves guilty of folly, guilty of gambling, guilty of paganism, guilty of discrediting the Bible, guilty of a burning love for money, guilty of conducting a social club, guilty of creature-worship and assuming flattering titles, guilty ot political meddling, and responsible for much of Communism’s successes. By fleecing the flock instead of feeding the flock, Christendom’s clergy have caused spiritual famine. They have only chaff and husks to offer from their spiritual larder. They have starved the people to the point of spiritual death, Isaiah truthfully said: “Their religion is a mockery.”—29:13, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Hence, how wrong President Truman was when he said, on March 12!—&quot;It is becoming increasingly apparent that religious faith is one of the most essential factors in the building of a world structure for peace and co-operation. . . . There is thus no greater need thap the advancement of the cause of religious faith among the peoples of the world, no matter what that faith may be.” He only high-lighted another of the popular follies of Christendom, namely, that it is <sup>e</sup>no matter what the faith may he’. All are different roads leading to the same place, they contend; and, of course, that one destination, we are to. believe, is heaven. This, too, is unscriptural. Instead of many true faiths, the Bible says: &quot;One Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all.” Also, Jesus spoke of a broad and well-traveled way to destruction, but a straight and narrow path to life, found by only a few. —Ephesians 4: 5, 6; Matthew 7:13,14.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>“Flee into the Mountains&quot;</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Because Jehovah’s witnesses call notice to religion’s failures, some hasty ones accuse them of conducting a hate campaign. Instead of peddling hate, Jehovah’s witnesses show love by taking the nourishing spiritual food of God’s Word, the wheat and corn, to persons in starving Christendom. These true Christian ministers allay the famine “of hearing the words of the Lord” that the prophet Amos foretold. (Amos 8:11) An illustration may clarify the point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Suppose a dam has broken and a mighty wall of water rumbles toward a community in a valley. Atop the mountainous sides of the canyon-valley stand Jehovah’s witnesses. They see the approaching destruction, and they shout out warnings. But the leaders .of the world community below tell the people to march along the level canyon floor, which is broad and easy for travel, allowing of many parallel trails for many to go abreast. The community rushes along the canyon floor to gain safety; at their leaders’ insistence the people ignore the warnings from the hills above, and refuse to take the straight and narrow and steep trail leading up to these heights. Those above can see something those below cannot: the canyon floor farther down suddenly drops off into a yawning chasm. The blind leaders lead the blind people along the many roads pn the easy canyon floor, telling that all the roads lead to the same place, salvation from the raging flood waters. But they all lead to the ditch of destruction. (Matthew 15:14) There is only the one narrow, steep trail that leads to safety, to the heights above the flood waters. Many take the narrow way, but they are few in proportion to the ones misled down the broad, easy way. And all the while the warning is faithfully shouted out from the little group of Witnesses on the heights, and they extend helping hands to the few climbing up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mountains symbolize Christ’s kingdom. (Isaiah 2:2; Matthew 24:16) Those there are instructed by God’s Word. It is an understanding of the prophecies of the Bible that gives them vision to see the coming destruction of Armageddon. They call out the warning, and urge others to join them in the safety heights. They do it in obedience to God’s command; they do it out of love for their neighbors. They serve others with the spiritual food from God’s Word to strengthen them for the hard climb up the narrow trail to safety and salvation from Armageddon’s flood of destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many persons of good-will toward God are in the world community below. Should the informed Witnesses allow these good persons to be fooled and led to the ditch of destruction just to spare the religious susceptibilities and reputations of sensitive clergymen, who are either fooled themselves or interested only in self-gain? No; to do so would be showing hate for them. To cry out in warning, to help honest ones to a knowledge of God’s truth, to point them the way to safety at all cost, all this is showing love and not hate for the peoples of Christendom, both the leaders and the led ones. Those who are wise will heed the warning, will feed upon the substantial spiritual food of God’s Word, will be strengthened, and will wak up the narrow trail that leads to eternal life in Jehovah’s new world.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">days of the western United States. Thousands of gold-mad pioneers poured into the Golden West in a search for the precious yellow metal. Of all the tales of lost mines that circulated among those gold-struck miners, perhaps the most famous was the myth of the “Lost Cabin Mine”. For many years miners had scoured the Cascade and Sierra Nevada mountains in search of the elusive “lost cabin” wealth. In 1853 eleven Californians undertook once again the search for that fabulous mine. And again they had come into the Klamath region in the southern part of the vast, unexplored Oregon country. But, with all their secrecy, their quest became known to pioneer-miner John Wesley Hillman. In haste Hillman organized a group of Oregonians, and soon they were off, trailing the Californian prospectors into the hills, intent on sharing their possible “find”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The spirit of “finders keepers” undoubtedly induced the party from California to split up in two groups upon realizing they were being followed. However; the counter-spirit of “share and share alike” prompted the Oregonians to do likewise. Day after day the grim game of hide-and-seek went on in the wilderness of Oregon. Soon, with plies nearly depleted and many</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">sup-men</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">.from both groups deserting, the two parties joined forces, only to find that during their wild chase they had lost all sense of direction. Of necessity they resorted to the age-old method of climbing high peaks so as to establish their whereabouts. Thus it was that on just such a mission John Wesley Hillman, leader of the combined group, made a “strike” more precious than the ore of “Lost Cabin Mine”, a “find” over which he could truly cry “Eureka!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One day as he rode—but wait, let Hillman tell of his discovery in his own words: “Suddenly we came in sight of water. We were much surprised, as we did not expect to see any lakes and did not know but that we had come in sight of and close to Klamath lake. Not until my mule stopped within a few feet of the rim of Crater Lake did I look down, and if I had been riding a blind mule I firmly believe I would have ridden off the edge to my death.” John Hillman and his party, on that day in 1853, were the first white men to discover what was, in 1869, officially named Crater Lake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Perhaps Hillman descended the wooded slope a short distance within the rim of the lake to what is now named Victor Rock, for from that vantage point an </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">excellent general view of this profoundly</span><span class="font7"> impressive sight is obtained. Without doubt one of the first sights capturing the gaze of the awe-struck Hillman was the more than twenty miles of unbroken cliffs remarkably sculptured from grotesquely contorted and twisted lava formations ranging from 500 feet to the dizzying height of 2,000 feet. It is this spectacle that encircles in cauldronfashion the deep, unbelievably Prussian blue sheet of placid water, in which the mirrored walls vie with the original in brilliancy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As miner Hillman stood in the midst of this fantastic fairyland, drinking in its beauty, his gaze fell upon irregular, unusual and volcanic Wizard island nearly two miles away on the western margin of the lake. But Wizard island was not the lone island on this “sapphire sea”. Lying at anchor within the shadow of Dutton Cliff was a craggy little islet. Its rugged hull-like base, with rocks towering like the masts of a ship, suggested its present name, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">the Phantom Ship.</span><span class="font7"> A phantom indeed, for it actually disap. pears from view when observed in certain lights from the western rim of the lake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What confused emotions and thoughts deluged the breathless Hillman we shall never know. Did he gaze in wonderment and admiration? Was he cut </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font7"> the ground with a recognition of his own insignificance and the majesty and glory of the Creator? In any event, of this one thing we can be certain; His discovery made known to white men one of the great contributions to earth’s natural beauty, Crater Lake.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Crater Lake; to Poet and Scientist</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Poet Joaquin Miller, moved by the rapturous beauty of this “lake of mystery”, mused:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The lake? The Sea of Silence? Ah, yes; I </span><span class="font6">had forgotten—so much else; besides, I should like to let it alone, say nothing. It took such hold on my heart, so unlike Yosemite, Yellowstone, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Grand Canyon, when</span><span class="font6"> first seen, that I love it almost like one of my own family. But fancy a sea of sapphire set around by a compact circle of the great grizzly rock of Yosemite. It does not seem so sublime at first, but the mote is in your own eye. It is great, great; but it takes you days to see how great. It lies 2,000 feet under your feet, and as it reflects its walls so perfectly that you cannot tell the wall from the reflection in the intensely blue water you have a continuous unbroken circular wall of 24 miles to contemplate at a glance, all of which lies 2,000 feet, and seems to lie 4,000 feet, below' Yet so bright, so intensely blue is the lake, that it seems at times, from some points of view, to lift right in your face-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“To the scientist,&quot; commented Congressman Sinnott in the House of Representatives on August 20, 1918, “[Cra-'ter Lake is] a mighty volcano collapsed within itself, Mount Mazama, 15,000 feet high, telescoped.” Imagine, if you can, a majestic mountain peak rearing its hoary head heavenward for 15,000 feet, seemingly </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">praising its Creator. That was </span><span class="font7">Mount Mazama, once a mighty volcano ranking with the largest of them, Hood, Rainier and the other volcanic monarchs of the Cascades. But that was ages ago. You see, no human eyes ever beheld Mount Mazama, but scientists have given us this mental picture through their meticulous study of Crater Lake’s geological history, history which witnessed one of nature’s strangest phenomena, Mazama’s destruction and the birth of Crater Lake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Long before man came the entire upper part of great Mount Mazama in some titanic cataclysm collapsed in upon itself as if gluttonously swallowed up by a subterranean cavern, leaving its crater-like lava sides cut sharply downward into the central abyss. Think of it! An underground cavity so immense as to</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">swallow the entire upper part of a 15,000-foot peak. The first awful depth of this vast hole no man can guess. But the angry volcano was not satisfied. It belched up through the seething pot of molten lava in three places, making lesser cones within this yawning crater, none of which were as high as the encircling rim nearly 4,000 feet above. Years, perhaps centuries, passed and gradually the dethroned volcanic king accepted his doom, namely, inactivity and extinction. The fires ceased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the years that followed mountain springs emptied their sparkling water into the vast crater, and thus began the tremendous task of filling this giant caldron with water. A co-laborer in performing this duty was the mountain precipitation in the form of snow and rain. In due time these allies completed their task by filling the phenomenal crater with 2,000 feet of blue, blue water. That day so many centuries ago saw the birth of Crater Lake, one of the wonders of the natural world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Because of the way it was formed, is it any wonder that geologists find Crater Lake of special interest? Many volcanoes have “blown their tops”, such as Mt. Rainier in Washington state, but no other in the United States has fallen in, collapsed, telescoped, like Mount Ma-zama. There are crater lakes in other lands, Italy, Germany, India and Hawaii; and although there are thousands of craters in this country, some even containing small lakes, there is but one great caldera in the world, and that nurtures the Crater Lake. Regarding its most interesting geological history, Joseph S. Diller, notable geologist of the United States Geological Survey, stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Aside from its attractive features Crater Lake affords one of the most interesting and instructive fields for study of volcanic geology to be found anywhere in the world. Considered in all its aspects it ranks with the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, the Yosemite Valley and the Falls of the Niagara, but with an individuality that is superlative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Crater Lake: to the Indian</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A lake of mystery it was indeed to its true discoverers, the Klamath and Modoc Indians. Around Crater Lake’s mysterious atmosphere grew many ancient religious Indian legends. The lake itself was revered by the red man, for according to the legend it was the mystic land of the Gaywas and the home of the great god Liao. His throne in the infinite depths of the blue waters of the lake was surrounded by giant crawfish, his warriors, who were able to lift great pincerlike claws out of the blue deep and seize inquisitive enemies who dared to venture too near the lake’s edge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Legend tells us that war broke out between Liao and Skell, the god of the neighboring Klamath marshes. Skell was captured and his heart was cut out and used for a ball by Liao’s monsters. But an eagle, one of Skell’s faithful, captured it in flight, and a coyote, another of the god’s devotees, escaped with it. Skell’s body grew again around his living heart and once more he was powerful, and once more he warred against the great god of the lake, Liao.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Skell obtained his vengeance by the eventual capture of Liao in a counter-offensive. But Liao was not so fortunate as the restored Skell. Upon the highest cliff overlooking the lake his body was cut in pieces and cast into the water and eaten by his own monsters, who were deceived into thinking that it was the body of the enemy Skell. However, when Liao’s head was thrust into the lake his servants realized whom they had devoured and refused to touch his head. To this day Liao’s head lies afloat in the lake, says the legend. The white men call it Wizard island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Through his religious superstition the Indian also conjured up the legend of a beautiful Indian princess of centuries gone by who pilots the eerie Phantom Ship on nocturnal excursions when the moon hangs bright in the night sky.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Wild Life amid Flowered Loveliness</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To the wild-life enthusiast the Crater Lake region is particularly interesting, since the fauna is found in abundance. Bears are numerous and unafraid. The Columbia black-tailed deer and antelope are seen occasionally, but do not become tame, since they spend the cold winter months below the boundaries of the park. Now and then the alert visitor will spot a coyote, wolf or cougar. Whistling marmots are very numerous, together with the prickly porcupine, and sly marten and weasel. The thrifty squirrel and the pert chipmunk are established residents of the area, and many are tame. It is not unusual to have them feed in one’s lap if the victuals of their choice are being served. Bird life is also to be found. The park teems with over 70 species of bird life, running from the lordly eagle to the petite hummingbird. Fishing is excellent in the lake. It is interesting to note that originally there were no fish of any kind in Crater Lake; but rainbow and black-spotted trout have been introduced and flourish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As for the flora, the Crater Lake region is a veritable fairyland with over 400 species of wild flowers having been classified. But take note: Crater Lake does not flaunt its floral beauty before the careless or indifferent. The flowered loveliness of the region is largely reserved for those who leave the beaten path and follow the winding mountain trails through untouched meadows, along babbling brooks and up the pumice slopes. In such tucked-away gardens one will find the avalanche lilies of creamy softness, the fiery-red Indian paintbrush, the earth-hugging pussy’s-paws, the purple aster, and many, many more. At blossom time a riot of vivid color greets the eye of the interested visitor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">By an act of Congress on May 22, 1902, the Crater Lake region became Crater Lake National Park, with 159,360 acres set aside from the public domain and dedicated to the park. In 1907 the first auto was driven to the lake’s rim, and since that time thousands of tourists have relived Hillman’s discovery. Many improvements have been made in the past few years for the convenience of the lake’s many guests. Not only can the gem of the Cascades be reached by many modern highways, but a 32-mile paved boulevard encircles the lake, with many vantage points along the way. Equipped camping grounds are provided for those who care to “rough it”; and a modern lodge for the traveler who desires the comforts of home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Regardless of the unwanted and unappreciated intrusions of civilization upon its natural beauty, Crater Lake remains silent, tolerant, peaceful with all men, and a compliment to its Creator.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">IVE instruction to a wise man, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">VT he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning?’ This principle expounded by wise King Solomon (Proverbs 9:9) was to a degree exemplified recently in Toledo, Iowa. On April 18, 1948, a public Bible lecture was scheduled by Jehovah’s witnesses. They informed the officials, for a similar meeting had been disrupted there in May, 1947. Nevertheless, the proposed meeting of April 18 was also broken up by rowdyism sponsored by the American Legion and condoned by city officials. A lesson in freedom of speech and worship and assembly was needed. It was given. It was learned. As a result, Toledo officials and Legionnaires are wiser in freedom’s ways and are now a credit to their community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">First, to get the picture of the rowdyism that prevented the Bible lecture and necessitated the lesson in fundamental freedoms, read the following report sent to the Civil Rights Section of \ the Department of Justice, in Washington, D.C., and submitted by the traveling minister of the Watchtower Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The following is a report of an assault and organized attempt to break up, and which did break up, a peaceful assembly of Christian persons gathered on the Tama County, Iowa, Courthouse lawn to hear an advertised Bible lecture on Sunday afternoon, April 18, 1948, at 3:00 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the week preceding the Sunday of the lecture, the mayor of Toledo, Iowa, Charles Gary, was notified of the proposed meeting as was also the sheriff of Tama county, Harry Sharp. The city of Toledo lies in Tama county. Both of these officials were reminded of the threats of violence that disrupted and prevented a similar Bible meeting last May, 1947, and of the likelihood that the same instigators of riot would again attempt to deprive the Christian group of persons known as Jehovah's witnesses from lawfully assembling and exercising their freedom of speech and worship. Protection was requested for Jehovah's witnesses in the exercise of these rights, the attention of the sheriff and the mayor being called to the Circuit Court ruling (No. 13,500, Eighth Circuit) in the notorious Lacona case. [For details see </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> of November 22, 1946, and of December 8, 1947.] Also, a letter was dispatched to the Director of Public Safety of Iowa, requesting* protection in the event of violence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Jehovah's witnesses began arriving at the Courthouse Park there were some boys batting a ball around on the east side of the park, by the bandstand. The west side was absolutely vacant. Not to disrupt the boys’ playing, the witnesses and others who came to hear the talk began to assemble on the vacant and unused west side of the square. Then more balls and bats were distributed by one, Harold Jones; a loud-speaker was set up across the street and another man, James Locke, speaking through the sound system began calling the teen-agers down where the witnesses’ meeting was assembling and incit</span><span class="font6">ing them to drive the balls hard and fast around’there, with the obvious purpose of preventing the meeting from being held. Many of those seated to hear the talk were forcefully struck with the hard-driven balls, and the young hoodlums would rush in after the balls to retrieve them and then hit them back into the group. All the while the loudspeaker, with James Locke at the microphone, continued to encourage the youngsters, Urging them on to greater boldness and vieious-ness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now the east side of the courtyard, on the other side of the courthouse itself, was completely bare and empty of persons, as Locke had the ballplayers come over to where the Witnesses had gathered on the west. The latter persons, realizing the<sup>1</sup> impossibility of holding a meeting and listening to a lecture under those circumstances, decided to transfer back to the vacant east side, where no one now was, and there Jiave the meeting. As this was being done, Locke's voice sounded Over the loudspeaker telling the young peace-disturbers to quickly spread out all over the park, “don't stay in one place, let's go J Step it up in there! Spread out, all over!&quot; The excited youths eagerly complied, and as the Christian assembly once again began to get underway the yelling, screaming, wild-acting boys and girls renewed their assaulting activities, Another adult ringleader, to whom the young persons gave heed readily and who was very instrumental in the disgraceful disrupting of the meeting, was “Coach” Irving Thompson, who kept telling the players not to gather anywhere but to keep spread out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Meanwhile Kenneth Holms, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, went to notify the mayor and sheriff of what was happening and to request them to take the necessary steps required of them to prevent the peaceable assembly from Being broken up and to restrain the peaceviolators, Sheriff Harry Sharp lives directly across the street from the courthouse square. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font6">wasn't home, but Mr. Holms met him in a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">car a </span><span class="font6">block away and requested he come down to the square and enforce the law against the responsible ones. He refused, saying he had another call which he had to attend to first and that he would take care of Holms' request later. Holms endeavored to reason with him and urge him to take immediate action, but the sheriff declined and went off in the opposite direction. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The mayor, Charles Cary, </span><span class="font6">wasn't at home. A call to the State Highway patrolman, Robert Grossniekle, resulted in his saying the matter was out of his jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Back at the-park, the lecturer, Frank May-kut, a representative of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc., began his talk of the afternoon. About the seated listeners, several of the male Jehovah's witnesses stood to shield the group from the hard-hitting balls which continued to be driven fiercely at the assembled group. The loudspeaker steadily blasted out encouragement to the ballplayers^ the childrep wildly yelled, and cars began to blow their horns, and after several minutes someone cut the electric wire leading to the sound equipment employed by the Bible lecturer giving the address. When he went on with his talk without the aid of such equipment, the noise and devilishness reached a new crescendo, making it all but impossible for the speaker to be heard. Even after the severed wire had .been repaired, the conditions rendered it impossible to go any further with the meeting, which was halted to see whether the local officials were available to restore peace and order. However, as referred to above, Mr, Holms’ efforts to arouse the sheriff and mayor had been in vain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The names of the teen-agers and youths responsible for injuring the persons listening to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font6"> lecture were obtained, among whom were the following: Thomas Kubik, Sally Culbertson, Laverne McColiister, Melvin Kupka, George Rosenberger, Gloria Applegate, Katherine Whalin, Shirley Brown. Others can be identified from pictures that were taken at the time. Those named are all of Toledo, Iowa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The number of persons assembled at the meeting was approximately sixty. The number of youths supposedly “playing ball” grew to more than that number, probably over one hundred The latter all responded obediently to the commands given over the loud-speaker used by Locke in a manner which indicated </span><span class="font4">the entire affair was part of an organized scheme to prevent the meeting. Even with the meeting disrupted, the abuse from batted balls continued, with yelling and confusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By this time a ear containing the sheriff, mayor, and one other person was slowly circling the block, viewing the proceedings. Seeing them, the lecturer, Frank Maykut, went over to their car and appealed for their help and that they exercise their authority in restoring peace so that the meeting could go on. Sheriff Sharp refused to do so. The mayor, Charles Gary, also made no move. “Not until there was bloodshed,<sup>33</sup> stated the sheriff. Then, sitting in the car on the east side of the park, these officials looked on while the democratic principles they are supposed to uphold were trampled underfoot. As a result, the meeting was completely broken up, the speech not delivered, and slowly the group began to disperse. The refusal of the officials named to protect the right of Jehovah's witnesses to exercise freedom of speech, worship and assembly contributed to the meeting’s disruption as their being present and not taking action gave sanction to what was taking place. Finally the loud-speaker, with James Locke again talking, blurted out: “Good work, kids! You’ve won the ball game!” It should be noted that no “game” was played, no bases used, nor any teams in evidence. The entire affair lasted over three hours. About twenty minutes of the scheduled hour discourse was delivered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The willful failure of these officials, Sheriff Harry Sharp and Mayor Charles Gary, to carry out their duty under the law, and the actions of James Locke, Harold Jones and Irving Thompson in subjecting citizens to the deprivation of their constitutional rights requires action by the United States Government under Section 51 and 52 of Title 18 of the U. S. Code.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Courage to Admit a Mistake</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now read the final outcome of the matter, as it was reported by Watchtower representative Frank J, Maykut, to that Society in his letter of May 24,1948:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You will recall my recent report regarding the disruption of a public lecture at Toledo, Iowa, on Sunday, April 18, 1948. It will interest you to learn of the events that have occurred since then.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I spent a considerable part of the following week conferring with county and city officials and, by the Lord’s grace, was able to give an effective witness concerning the nature and purpose of the Kingdom work. While most of them agreed the action of the Legionnaires was disgraceful, none would venture to give assistance in bringing the guilty ones to task, naturally. However, it was soon noised abroad that we were prepared to prosecute the lawviolators for breaking five city ordinances: assault, battery, unlawful assembly, disturbance of religious meeting, and playing ball on the courthouse lawn, which act is against the law. The whole town buzzed that week and the adults and teen-agers involved were chided for their foolishness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The county prosecutor listened .Jong and interestedly, and laughed at the predicament the local officials were placed in—until he found out we wanted him to handle the case. Nevertheless, he investigated the matter personally, admitted the law was completely on our side, but that the Legionnaires were sorry now and disposed to apologize. Sensing that the more substantial persons in Toledo were convinced an injustice had been done to the witnesses, we decided we would drop prosecution if a public apology would be tendered by the Legion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In a courtroom the following Saturday, Irving Thompson, commander of the Toledo American Legion Post, publicly apologized for himself and for James Locke and Harold Jones, both Legionnaires, for the part they played in the previous Sunday’s disturbance and violence. Many of the witnesses were present, and the county prosecutor, the sheriff, his deputy, a “man from the U. S. government”, the Legionnaires involved, and some unidentified persons. They were told that the apology was accepted in good faith and that the future would give them opportunity to prove they meant it. Mentioned, too, was the fact we harbored no ill will, were solely interested in the preaching of the Kingdom gospel and not in prosecuting individuals in courts of law. The latter would only be done when it was necessary to secure our right to freely worship the Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Prior to the commander’s apology, I was given the opportunity of addressing those assembled and explained our position in the matter, as well as give a testimony to the Kingdom, which they listened to. I explained the probable point of contention: nonparticipation in war; emphasized the fact that not one witness of Jehovah fought under the flag of a foreign power bent on the destruction of the United States, not one had fought to kill Americans, whereas thousands of members of the orthodox Catholic and Protestant faiths living in totalitarian lands had participated in war against this country. It appears this fact was news to the commander, and he so stated in his following talk, declaring he had never considered that fact before. He added: “If you folks have that which will bring peace to this earth, I’m all for you, but you’ll have to explain to a lot of other people this point that has been cleared up in my mind now.” He promised no further molestation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Immediately we laid plans for a public lecture to test the truthfulness of their word and to give the good people of Toledo another chance to hear the Kingdom message. May 23 was the date selected. That day broke clear, warm and sunny—ideal for an outdoor lecture. The talk.lasted the full sixty minutes, not a sign of opposition appeared, 137 persons were counted listening to the talk, including many who sat on their porches during the entire meeting. Jehovah again had triumphed over those who wittingly or unwittingly try to halt the advance of Kingdom truth on earth! </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">To</span><span class="font4"> Him goes the honor for so marvelous a witness to His name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It takes not only an honest man but also a courageous man to admit a wrong so publicly committed and to publicly apologize for it. Moreover, the change of conduct on the part of the Legion commander was apparently based on a change of mind relative to the work of Jehovah’s witnesses, which change was made possible by his willingness to be instructed as to the true nature of that work. That the lesson was learned with practical benefit to the community was evidenced by the successful holding of the Bible lecture in the city of Toledo on May 23. Thus the patient instruction given to men inclined to wisdom resulted in increased opportunities for learning for the entire city, not just in the field of freedoms, but in the still more vital field of the Holy Scriptures.</span></p>

Cases of additional hundreds await settlement. The government claims all those shot were Communists and murderers, all duly tried and convicted. It also claims the wholesale shootings are approved by the American military mission. Perhaps so, but the policy of this American-backed government smacks sickeningly of Nazism. Where is the American conscience?</span></p>

The jet is propelled through the skin by a spring that gives a pressure of nearly two tons to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font3"> square inch, but the jet is so tiny (1/37 as large as that of the usual needle) that the actual pressure exerted is only 11 grams. It is claimed that six out of ten patients cannot even feel the injection, three know when it takes place, and only one in ten feels a pricking sensation. Surely none will lament the passing of the needle.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">N THE world of perfume one meets all kinds of individuals, each having its own personality. You know many of them, both masculine and feminine of different nationalities, and recognize them on the street. Here is an oriental type; over there one with a French ac-' cent; one from Arabia just passed; and coming toward you is an American type. Some perfumes only whisper as they pass, but others scream from across the street. Did you&lt;notice that dainty number that just passed with a flowery spring in her step? Watch out! here comes a heavy scent, a real toughy with a body odor that will knock you out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Walking along the concourse many perfumes remind one of beautiful flower gardens and green parks. One catches a spring breath of crocuses, violets and hyacinths, or the intoxicating aroma of orange blossoms and apple blossoms, or the summer -warmth of roses and jasmines, or the smell of the cool forest and its peaceful carpet of pine needles. At social gatherings one also rubs noses with a variety of quaint perfume odors. Some are old acquaintances, sedate ladies and retired gentlamen of the “gay nineties”. Others are frisky, breezy things that sway and swing to modern</span></p><img src="g_E_19480722_files/g_E_19480722-12.png" alt="" style="width:245pt;height:171pt;">
<p><span class="font7">ers are good mixers. Some remind one of pleasant dreams; others, of mad nightmares. Some perfumes are such domineering rugged individualists that everybody is happy when they stay by themselves. And then there is always the overbearing intruder that loves to stick his business into your nose. But the ones you want to w’atch out for are the seductive scents that snuggle up and spread their hypnotic enchantment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Perfumes, like people, are found in all walks of life. Some perfumes are aristocrats, the social elite that frequent opera houses and swanky night clubs. Some are middle-class folks that work hard doing honest jobs in the household, office and factory, for which we are all very thankful. Some are hussies of the lowest sort that hang around gambling dens and dance halls. And then there are some perfumes that are outright pickpocket rogues that take your money and leave but a faint trail of scent behind them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Beyond an olfactory acquaintance most people know very litfle about these fragrant personalities. They have only a vague knowledge of the background' and history of perfumes, their composi-'tion and usefulness, or their influence upon human minds and lives. And yet</span></p><img src="g_E_19480722_files/g_E_19480722-13.png" alt="" style="width:261pt;height:171pt;">
<p><span class="font7">probably no other commodity that is so interwoven with the history and adventure of ancient trade and commerce as that of precious perfume,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Cleopatra, said to be the first high priestess of the cosmetic cult, bewitched Caesar and Antony with her Egyptian Kyphi perfume </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">and her aegyptiwn</span><span class="font7"> foot lotion. Nero, who was extravagant beyond measure with perfumes, wasted more of the stuff at his wife’s funeral than was produced in all Arabia in ten years. A Greek poet of the fourth century B.C. tells how doves were drenched with perfume and turned loose in a house to spray and saturate the furnishings with fragrance. Hippocrates, said to be the father of medicine, even attributed therapeutic value to perfumes. In the early 1920’s when archaeologists opened the tomb of King Tut they found that the bottles of perfume buried by the Egyptians 3,000 years ago still gave off aromas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Arabia, a land that still breathes of ancient romance and perfume, the two being inseparable, is thought by many to be the home of perfumery. In the distant past Arabian women bathed their bodies in the smoke of burning spice, hence the name </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">perfume (per,</span><span class="font7"> meaning “by” or &quot;through”; </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">fumus,</span><span class="font7"> meaning “smoke”). Phoenicians sailing to the magic lands of Zanzibar, Ceylon and Sumatra brought back precious plants for the perfumers. China too, a thousand years before Christ, compounded fragrant odors from mystic musk. And from India and its enchantments came sandalwood and aromatic botanicals for the perfumer’s secret formulas.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>From Bible Times to Modern Times</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">More ancient than any of these records is the account found in the Bible. There, at Genesis 37:25, it tells how the camels that carried Joseph captive into Egypt 1,700 years before Christ also carried spices, balm and myrrh for the perfume industry of that first world power. Mention of perfume at later dates is also found in the Bible. Therein is given the recipe for the holy and highly perfumed anointing oil used by the Levitical priesthood. The queen of Sheba brought with her rare perfume spices. Spikenard, saffron, calamus, cinnamon, frankincense, myrrh and aloes —all used in perfumes—are mentioned in the poetic Song of Solomon. From Persia the Magi brought gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh to the manger in Bethlehem. And Mary anointed the feet of Jesus with a costly perfumed ointment of exquisite fragrance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the Dark Ages, when the Boman </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Hierarchy ruled the world </span><span class="font7">with the sword of superstition and ignorance, perfumery, like all the other sciences, was practically lost. Alchemists were classified </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">as sorcerers by the </span><span class="font7">clergy. However, Moslem culture in the Near East preserved the ancient art, and even learned, in the tenth century A.D., how to distill aromatic waters to recover their sweet odors in concentrated form. From them the Crusaders learned the art of perfumery and introduced these sweet-smelling personalities to ill-smelling Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">France’s history, as a land of perfume, goes back no farther than the sixteenth century when an Italian by the name of Rene set up shop in Paris under the sponsorship of Catherine de’ Medici. Louis XV demanded that his apartment be furnished with a different one each day of the year. Madame de Pompadour spent half a million francs a year for haunting scents. Marie Antoinette was more subtle in her choice of perfumes. Napoleon was very extravagant in its use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Meantime staid England endeavored to resist the rising tide of perfume by an Act of Parliament. In 1770 it was proposed that “virgins, maids or widow’s” who would “seduce and betray into matrimony any of His Majesty’s subjects by the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">scents&quot; would</span><span class="font7"> “incur the penalty of the law in force against witchcraft” and the marriage would be declared null and void. But for all the good it did they might as well have legislated against the flowers as to outlaw the use of perfumes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then there is Grasse, international capital of perfumery, “sweetest town on earth,” richest per capita in all France. Grasse, the industry’s' “Mecca”, where the high priests of perfumery, who lead the rest of the world around by the nose, brew their liqueur according to the most Secret of formulae, with deft hands and hypersensitive noses.

<p><span class="font7">There is more to a perfume than one can smell. Not simple compounds, they are mixtures of the most complex chemicals, which give each perfume a personality and character all its own. There are no less than 30 ingredients in each recipe, and some have as many as 2,000! These are not just thrown together, but are considered as building blocks, each of a definite size, weight and shape, which can be arranged into a hundred thousand scent patterns, according to the dictates of the perfumer’s fancy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Regardless of whether the perfume is a solid, like the ungents, or a liquid or powder, it has three components, namely, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">base</span><span class="font7"> of essential oils and aromatic chemicals that makes the odoriferous part, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">fixative</span><span class="font7"> that gives “life” and durability to the odor, and the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">solvent</span><span class="font7"> or diluting vehicle that thins down the concentrated smell to a weakness that can be handled and enjoyed by the sensitive human sniffer. The last item, w’hich in the case of liquids is usually alcohol, makes &gt;up from 84 to 88 percent of the formula. The fixative and aromatic oils and chemicals, though the most numerous, are the least in quantity. As an example, a simple perfume may have a bouquet of floral, oriental and modifying odors. The floral consisting of jasmine, violet, rose, carnation, orange blossom and minosa, plus oils of citronella and geranium. To these are added the oriental odors of sandalwood, vetiver, styrax and patchouli, and the modifying odors of coumarin, oak moss and ylang ylang, and not leaving out, of course, the important fixative like musk. It seems almost unbelievable, but in some of the complicated mixtures sometimes an infinitesimal amount—as small as one part in 50,000—of certain elements are added to give a particular touch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Perfume making,” to quote Erie Eichwald, “is first a science, then an art.” And it takes the two to make perfumes of exquisite harmony. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Harmony,</span><span class="font7"> that is the secret of the whole thing. Perfumes are really symphonies in odors, and like musical symphonies, they are composed of different notes, some high, others low, some heavy, others light, yet all blended together in a pleasant and perfect harmony. Odors that clash must be avoided as much as notes that clash or colors that clash, if there is to be harmony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the realm of creative perfumery “noses” are graded as “good”, “big” or “great”. There are only twenty “good noses” in France, and in the whole world there are no more than six or seven “great noses”. These are the ones that can instantly identify at least 7,000 </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">dis</span><span class="font7">-tinct substances by their smell and can tell the color of flowers in the dark by their odors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What a Spectrum of Odors!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the receiving platform of the modern perfumery that makes its own bases are materials from all over the world. Some of the materials are seeds, barks, roots, leaves and flowers.' Some are sticky gums. The scent-secretions of animals supply the fixatives. Castoreum. or “castor” comes from Canadian beavers. Putrid-smelling civet, worth 40,000 francs per kilo, comes from the big civet cats of Africa. Precious musk, worth twice as much as civet, comes from the Asiatic musk deer. Muse Zibata Comes' from muskrats of American swamps. And ill-smelling, waxy ambergris, valued at more than $1,000 a pound, is produced by sick sperm whales.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To the perfumer roses are not just roses, even when selection is limited to ■’a few varieties. The kind of soil, the type of fertilizer, the amount of heat and cold, humidity and sunlight, and even the altitude affect the finished essences of flowers. The exact time of day when jasmines and carnations are picked is very important. Between daybreak and the rising of the morning dew jasmines are picked to prevent a 20-percent loss in their fragrance, but not until three hours of uninterrupted sunshine has bathed the carnation is it ready to be picked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The processing of these raw'materials is according to many trade secrets known only to the perfume hierarchy. Steam distillation is the most extensive method used, but, due to the harshness of the heat, its use is limited to the hardier flowers, and the barks and leaves. Orange, lime and lemon peels, as well as bergamot, have their oils extracted by mechanical pressure. Maceration, a hot-fat process once used extensively, has now largely been replaced by solvent extraction, using alcohol, petroleum, ether, or some other solvent. Hyacinths, orange blossoms, roses and mimosa are treated this way. The slowest and most expensive of all methods, called “enfleurage”, is reserved for the sensitive jasmine and tuberose. This consists of laying the individual petals in contact with layers of highly refined lard which absorb the delicate odors without the use of heat. Thereafter the flower essence is removed and Absolute </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Jasmine is obtained worth </span><span class="font7">more than $1,000 a pound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With the advances in synthetic chemistry this twentieth century has succeeded in producing hundreds of artificial odors which resemble to a large degree the perfume personalities found in nature. There are some .exceptions, like rose, sweet pea and jasmine, that have no competitors in the coal-tar chemicals. In the aromatic field few natural odors are used any more, even in the most expensive perfumes.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Scents for Every Whim and Fancy</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Every day one bumps one’s nose into dozens of these scented individuals. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Nylons, tobacco, furniture polish, paints, </span><span class="font7">soap and plastics are made more pleasing with perfumes. Bread wrappers have a “fresh baked” odor added. Plastic dog bones smell like beef. Rubber bait for mousetraps smell like cheese.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The oldest use of perfume, and the one that is still the most important, is by humans on themselves. Humans in their fallen and degenerate state fall far short of smelling like flowers, and so they cm deavor to improve their own personalities by taking on the masking scent of a perfume. The effect is purely psychological, but because of this it affects man’s emotional state. Odors are interpreted as sw<sup>T</sup>eet or sour, fragrant or foul, cooling or pungent, pleasing or nauseating. So also, certain odors are associated with sex, having strong power to excite passion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This explains why, in these “last days” when music, art and science are overemphasizing man’s baser passions, the perfumeries are called upon to produce more and more seductive and passionate odors. As noted by one perfumer, quoted by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">C oilier'’s</span><span class="font7"> magazine, perfumes today are intended to “make the shiest little female smell reckless, exotic, magical, frenzied, intoxicating, daring, menacing, imprudent, heady, breathless, provocative, dangerous, secret, forbidden, alluring, sinful, mysterious, &quot;desirable, seductive, exciting, tempting, magnetic, enticing, tantalizing—even irresistible !”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At least the ads say so.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Earthly Background of Messiah</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">N CONNECTION with his prophecy about the beginning of Messiah’s rule over the earth, the prophet Daniel said: “</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">An</span><span class="font7">d none of the wicked shall understand; hut the wise shall understand.” (Daniel 12:10) The man who, whether Jew or Gentile, gives his heart to Jehovah God and devotes himself wholly to the service of God and His Messiah in obedience to the divine commands is a wise person, because be is taking the wise course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The prophet Moses was a type of the Messiah the King. Other faithful men, such as Joshua, David, etc., performed parts in Jewish history in which they pictured the Messiah, namely, Jesus Christ, whose earthly background identifies Him as the foretold Anointed One. The title ‘‘Messiah” means “Anointed One”, and it applies to Jehovah’s King whom He anoints for the promised kingdom of God, the royal government of the Most High God. By His prophets He. foretold and caused to be written down in the record that the birthplace of the Messiah would be Bethlehem-judah. (Micah 5:2) The name of Moses’ successor Joshua also foreshadowed that ' Messiah’s name would be Jesus, the Greek pronunciation for Joshua, and Isaiah 9:6, 7 declared He would be given the title “Prince of Peace” and the government of a righteous new ■world would rest upon His shoulder, and that He would be God’s Minister to bestow life everlasting upon obedient men, for which reason He ■would become their</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Everlasting Father”. In God’s due time these prophecies began to be fulfilled with the birth of the child Jesus at the foretold place. Jehovah God used Jewish men of low degree, who were faithful to Him, to be witnesses to the great event. These Jews were shepherds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Near the town of Bethlehem these shepherds were guarding their flocks of sheep by night, when their attention was suddenly arrested by the manifestation of the glory of Jehovah God about them. Luke, a news reporter, describes it for us, saying: “And there Avere in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ [or, in Hebrew, Messiah] the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.” Then quickly followed a song sung by a heavenly host to the glory of Jehovah God: “And suddenly tilery was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying. Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, andong men of good-wall.”—Luke 2:8-14; </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Such is the brief account of the earthly birth of Jesus, who as Messiah must rule the, new world in righteousness, and not even Moses the transmitter of Jehovah’s law to Israel had such a spectacular accompaniment to his birth. God selected a virgin Jewess named Mary, a descendant of King David, to be the human mother of Jesus, but her conception of Him was not by the power of any man of David’s line but was by the power of the spirit of Almighty God. (Matthew 1:18-23-) So He was not a Levite as was Moses. God transferred the life of His mighty Son from the spirit realm in Heaven to the virgin’s womb that He might be born of a woman, be a perfect man, and therefore possess the full Sualifications to purchase humankind by tie sacrifice of His perfect life. To show us further the prophetic background on earth of the Messiah, Jehovah God said through the prophet Isaiah: “Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.&quot; The name “Immanuel” means “God with us”, not that Jesus was Jehovah God but that He was God’s representative among men and was a sign of God’s favor with men of good-will. (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1: 23) That He reflected God’s </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">glory</span><span class="font7"> to men, we read, at John 1:14: “And the Word was made fleshj and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.” So He was not &quot;God incarnate”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Jesus was a child twelve years of age He sat among the learned men of Jerusalem, and by His questions and answers to them concerning the Holy Scriptures those men were greatly astonished. There He displayed eagerness to carry out the will of His Father, the Almighty God. (Luke </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">2:46-49) </span><span class="font7">From that time onward Jesus grew into manhood’s estate and greatly increased in wisdom, above that of Moses, who was learned in all the wisdom of Egypt. “And Jesus increased in wisdom </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font7"> stature, and in favour with God and man.” (Luke 2: 52) The age of maturity of Jesus,,when He possessed the qualification for beginning His Messianic ministry among the Jews, was when He was thirty years of age. He then presented himself before God for John to baptize Him in Jordan that He might thus fulfill His Father’s commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In that baptism He pictured that God had made a covenant with Him and that He had agreed to do God’s will. His baptism in water was an outward testimony to that effect. His language, according to the prophecy, was: “Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, 0 my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.” (Psalm 40:7,8; Hebrews 10:5-9) Then what happened, as a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">further background to </span><span class="font7">identify Him as the real Messiah? We read: “And Jesus, wdien he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: and lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” (Matthew 3:16,17) Here the testimony from heaven shows Jehovah recognized Jesus as His Beloved Son, to whom </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">He had</span><span class="font7"> committed the work of being the Messianic King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Within a short time after His baptism Jesus began to preach and instruct the people. Among His first words addressed to the Jews were these: “Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” (Matthew 4:17) Throughout the rest of His earthly ministry He preached and prepared men for the Messianic kingdom, and finally He died as a martyr for that kingdom, thereby finishing His earthly course. This was as the prophecies </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">concerning the Messiah had foretold.</span><span class="font7"> For this valid cause Jehovah God raised Him from the dead and exalted Him to His own right hand, Let all men know, therefore, both Jew and Gentile, that the Messiah who shall yet fulfill all </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">the glorious prophecies concerning</span><span class="font7"> God’s kingdom over earth will not be a Messiah in the flesh, but a heavenly Messiah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">It takes years to grow a tree; a short season of neglect to destroy it. Proper trimming and first-aid binding can do much to prevent decay, but when decay has set in drastic steps must be taken. As in the case of a bad tooth, the decay must be drilled and chiseled out and the re-culting cavity filled; that is, if the tree is worth saving. The “dental work” is best done from May through July. Determine the size and shape of the decayed area by test drillings, then with mallet and chisel chip out the decay, making the back of the hole larger than the front so that the filling will wedge in firmly. The filling used is a smooth sand concrete, but is packed in only after the cavity has been disinfected with a solution of 1 part bichloride of mercury to 1,600 parts alcohol and then painted with asphalt paint. Moreover, some trees having an abundance of sap must have a drainage arrangement for their “operation”, as do many operations performed upon humans. This consists of a vertical channel along the back of the cavity, ending in a small pocket at the base of the cavity. Thence a drain hole, fitted with a small pipe casing, carries out the</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Animals may nibble at rose petals occasionally, and bees may feast on rose nectar, but we hardly think of the rose as a source of food. Yet close relatives of the rose yield some of the most important fruits. You’ve met many of the members of her family, perhaps without knowing of their relationship to the fragrant rose. To name a few, there is the apple, plum, cherry, peach, strawberry, raspberry, blackberry and pear. The pear traces its origin far back into the family tree, far back into Europe’s history. Though Europe has 5,000 kinds of pears to North America’s 1,000, the United States can claim place as the leading producer in the New World. Surely a fragrant and tasty family, the rose!</span></p>

The various articles of the bill lay Strong stress on the equality of $11 human creatures before the law, regardless of “race, color, sex, language, religion, property or other status, or national or social origin”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Article 1G provides: “Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief,, and freedom either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.”</span></p>

The Russians completely halted passenger traffic Into their zone ostensibly to shut out the devalued Western marks. At the same time the currency reform was attacked by the.Communists and bitterly denounced as the cause of lowered standards of living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">French Assembly and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Six-Power Pact</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The French Assembly, oh June 17, voting 297-289, hesitantly endorsed th^ six-power London agreement on Western Germany, giving Germans in the western zones the right to handle their internal affairs under a minimum of Allied control and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">supervision. The assembly at</span><span class="font4">tached six conditions to their authorization, however, enjoining the government to seek (1) in-tfernatlonalizatlon of Ruhr industries and mines; (2) expropria</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">tion </span><span class="font4">of properties of former Ruhr magnates; (3) long-period occupation of Germany; (4) guaran</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">tees </span><span class="font4">against reconstruction of an authoritarian Germany; (5) further action on the economic and political organization of Europe; </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Sud </span><span class="font4">(6) four power agreement ozj Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font4">French General Confederation of Labor called for a strike demonstration to register protest </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">against </span><span class="font4">the action of the Cabinet and the Assembly in connection with the six-power German pact</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Churchill on the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Labor</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Government</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&lt;$&gt; The Labor government of Britain was slyly twitted by Winston Churchill, addressing a political rally of 7,000 Young Conservative party members on June 12. He pointed out that government’s inconsistency in finding fault with the United States* system of private enterprise while at the same time being dependent on that system for aid. Said he; “How the ministers can deride the system of free enterprise and capitalism which makes America great and wealthy and then at the same time eagerly] seek the aid which has hitherto' been so generously granted from across the Atlantic—that is a grimace which b&amp;ffies the limitations of our language to explain,’*</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Education in Hungary</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&lt;$&gt; The Hungarian Parliament, ontJune Ifl, adopted nationalization of all educations, including schools formerly religious. The Roman Catholic bi sb op<sub>?</sub> Msgr. Sandor Kovacs, Issued a pastoral letter two days later stating that teachers of church schools might decide &quot;according to conscience&quot; whether or not to continue teach</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font4">under nationalization. Since </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">pope Is the arbiter of conscience, this does not suggest independent action on the part of any of the Catholic teachers, though seeming to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Freedom In Greece</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&lt;$&gt; According to a Religious News Service dispatch of June 17, the Greek government sponsored by the United States still opposes democratic freedoms. The dispatch froar Athens reads: “Thirty-four members of the Jehovah's witnesses sect were arrested here while holding Sunday services in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">the home of a high ranking</span><span class="font4"> employee of the American Mission for Aid to Greece* Reason for the arrest was not disclosed. The witnesses, twenty of whom were women, were brought before the district attorney, who questioned them and later gave them their freedom, declaring they would be Judged' later. Early this year sect members were told they must file declarations of their religious affiliation with Greek Orthodox parishes In which they live. Previously, the Holy Synod of the Orthodox Church announced the appointment of a committee to Investigate Jehovah’s witnesses* activities.” So goes religious freedom in church-state dictatorships.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Abductions of Greek Children</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Press reports of June 20 claimed that between 8,000 and 10,000 Greek children had been kidnaped by General Markos Vafl-ades* rebel guerrilla army and sent to camps in the Soviet satellite states to the north. Communists asserted that the children had been, abandoned, arrested or deported, and generally neglected by the &quot;monarchofascist*<sup>1</sup> Greek government</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Greek War on Guerrillas</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Greek national army has been sent out to make a major attack on the guerrilla forces in northern Greece. In fart, an all-out campaign against the forces of General Markos Vaflades was launched in mld-June. The army had been considerably strengthened by supplies and ammunition obtained from America, and the move to take drastic action against the guerrillas took In an area of some 1,000 square miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The maneuver seeks to creak up the guerrillas completely, isolat* ing them from the Soviet-bloc </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">states bordering on Greece</span><span class="font4"> and the support they have been receiving from that source.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Terrorism In Malaya</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&amp; High Commissioner Sir Edw Gent, on June 18, announced a state of emergency for all Malaya. A wave of terrorism, alleged to have been caused by </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ComiEiintsts, was in evidence </span><span class="font4">throughout the nine states of the Malay Federation. Violence reached a peak in Perak and Johore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Truman on the U. N,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&lt;$&gt; Speaking at Golden G&amp;te Park, San Francisco, June 13, President Truman said that the U. JV. charter wa# “the constitution of the world”, and would eventually settle all differences among nations, although it might take generations to make it work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Truman Indicts Congress</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&lt;$&gt; Summing up his indictment of the 80th Congress, President Truman, June 14, mentioned eight things about </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">which</span><span class="font4"> he </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">said they </span><span class="font4">had been derelict and about which something should be done before adjournment. The eight ‘musts* were: (1) Priee controls and allocation of materials; (2) housing legislation; (3) larger appropriations for Labor Department and Bureau of Labor Statistics; (4) Increased social </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">security; (5) a national</span><span class="font4"> health and medical care plan; (6) extension of federal aid for educa-tlon; (7) renewal of support prices for agriculture; (8) larger appropriations for reclamation and power development In the West.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Congress, however, had different ideas as to what was important, and passed bills dealing with the draft, foreign aid, admitting displaced persons, farm aid (see No. 7), and pay rises for federal workers; but efforts to pass a housing bill failed. The Communist-control bill also failed of passage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Congressional Effort</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The 80th U. S. Congress, during the period of its term of office, has not been Idle, although there has been much talk—some 32,000,000 words since January 3, 1947, when its members, 524 men and. 7 women, convened for the first time. The Eightieth has con-sidered more than 11,000 bills and resolutions since that date, the House passing more than 2,000, the Senate over 1,700. More than 1,000 of these, passing both houses and receiving the presidential signature, became law. Sixty-one were vetoed by the president, and six of these were passed over his vein. Three overriding votes came during the third week in June, the measures enacted barring certain workers from Social Security coverage, removing the U, S. Employment Service from the Labor Department, and exempting railroad rate agreements from the antitrust laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">U, S. Draft BUI</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After long debate and delay, winding up in a 17-hour filibuster by Senators Taylor anil Langer, the draft bill was rushed through its final stages and given Senate approval in the early morning hours of June 19, followed by House of Represent^ fives passage late the same day. Under the terms of the compromise bill, over 200,000 American youth (from 19 through 25 years old) will be drafted for 21 months, subject to being sent out on military or other duty anywhere In the world. Inductions may begin 90 days after the president signs the bill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">£</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Senate Proclaims Military</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Aid Plan</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&lt;§&gt; By a vote of 64-4 the Senate, on June 11, proclaimed its support of a policy which w<sup>T</sup>tll commit the U- S. to the principle of giving military aid to defensive alliances formed among the world’s free nations. Such help would, however, be given only with the approval of Congress in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">each </span><span class="font4">case, and under bests taking Into consideration the military security of the U. S. and the mutual aid guaranteed by the applicants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Mundt Bill Burled</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The doom of the Mundt bill, also known as the Communist-control bill, was sealed June 17, w<sup>T</sup>hen the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee decided that there was not enough time for the Senate to act on it before adjournment. He also disclosed that U. S. Attorney General Tom C. Clark had advised the committee that some sections of the bill were unconstitutional. There were many throughout the nation who felt very strongly that the bill as a w<sup>T</sup>hole w’as unconstitutional and that It smelled of the Inquisition. At any rate, the bill is not likely to raise its head again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Investigation of FCC</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The U. S. House of Representatives (June 19) voted 174-50 for an investigation of the Federal Communications Commis-Sion. It appointed a five-man committee to ascertain whether the .. Commission has licensed radio stations owned or controlled by subversive or Communist-front organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">U, S, Soft-Cob! Dispute</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&lt;$&gt; President Truman (June 19) set up a board to study the soft-coal dispute, which “if permitted to continue” would, he said, °im* peril the national health and safety.&quot; The president's move is, under the Taft-Hartley Act, a preliminary step to obtaining an injunction which would prevent an 80-day walkout contemplated by the soft-coal miners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Republican Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The third week in June the Republican convention got under way in Philadelphia. The close of the week brought the unexpected declaration by Governor Kim Sigler, of Michigan, that Senator Arthur Vandenberg was willing to become the Republican candidate for the presidency if the party wanted him. All of the. candidates continued to Issue confident^ statements of anticipated victory for themselves, while seeking to negotiate deal^ that would make the result probable. One of the more-talked-of deals was that In which Stassen would, presumably, accept nomination to the vice-presidency in return for having his delegates vote for Taft as presidential candidate. Stassen denied it</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Platform plans included consideration of a bill of rights plank, which would declare against the poll tax, lynching, racial segregation In the armed services, and unfair employment practices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jet Fighters to Germany</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Air Force announced on June 18 that the 36th Fighter Wing, equipped with Lockheed F-80 Shooting Stars, would be transferred from the Panama Canal Zone to Germany later in the year, the first United States jet-propelled service airplanes to be sent to Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Cairo Holocaust</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Cairo’s Jewish quarter 25 persons were killed and more than 30 w’ounded on June 20 as the result of an explosion of undetermined origin, wrecking eight houses and damaging others. The cause of the accident, if accident it was, remained a mystery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">/Surgery to End Body Fain</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The 73rd annual meeting of the American Neurological Association on June 16 heard a report that a new kind of brain surgery has successfully relieved incurable and intolerable body pain. Patients showed no undesirable aftereffects as to mentality or personality traits. The operation isolates one of the prefrontal lobes of the brain by severing certain nerve fibers. Of the ten patients undergoing </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">operation seven obtained complete relief, two nearly complete relief, while one obtained </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font4">beneficial results.</span></p>
