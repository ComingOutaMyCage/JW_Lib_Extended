<p><span class="font25">BRITAIN’S DEVALUATION DUNKIRK</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">By “Awake!” correspondent In Britain</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">T</span><span class="font17">HE devaluation Dunkirk which Britain now faces has arisen from one of the gravest financial and economic crises in the nation's history. It will demand ail the resolution and sustained endeavor that characterized the British military epic of Dunkirk in World War II to get the nation out of its present predicament But even given all the unity of purpose which this people can muster when occasion demands it is not at all certain wl ^ther the economic and financial difficulties will be completely surmounted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">When Prime Minister Attlee told the nation on October 24 that they were entering on their last chance to save Britain’s future as a trading nation it will be readily appreciated that devaluation means much more than the mere &quot;adjustment ip the rate of exchange between the pound sterling and the dollar’&quot;, as devaluation is so euphemistically termed in public speeches by certain ministers of the government. And yet in the face of so grave a situation neither the prime minister nor the Cabinet seems inclined to take thoroughly courageous and drastic action and thus give a realistic lead to the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">To traders and others the decision to devalue came as something of a shock, but in financial circles it had been more or less expected, notwithstanding Sir Stafford Cripp’s firm assurance that there would be no devaluation of sterling. What was surprising, even to the financiers, was the lowness of the rata chosen for the pound. It wp.s $2,80 to the pound, which represents a depreciation of about 30 percent, whereas nobody had previously thought it would he more than 20-25 percent, a dollar rate of 3 or 3,20 to the pound. Since 1939 the pound sterling had been worth in terms of dollars $4,03. The heavy reduction in value necessarily dealt a severe blow to trading relationships throughout the world, for Britain is the banker of the sterling area. It is, of course, too early at the time of writing to report on the full effects of devaluation, but they can be reasonably well anticipated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Causes of the “Dollar Gap?*</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Before dealing with the effects of devaluation, however, a brief review might be given of the economic difficulties which led up to Britain’s reluctant decision. Her difficulty in making ends meet is to be traced predominantly to the direct effects which war had on its economy. Apart from affecting Britain, one of the World War’s general effects has been a changed pattern of world trade by reason of the increased dependence of all other nations on the United States, both as a source of primary products and as a market for manufactured goods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The war left the United States the world’s chief creditor nation, having a</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">favorable trade balance with almost every oilier country and particularly with Britain, The wide disparity between the total value </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font11"> Anremsan rtnpurt? iff Co Britain and the value of British exports to the United states mad its actrnmulated deficit for Britain is known as the dollar gap, and the crux of the problem for Britain has been and still is to close that gap and make trade between the two countri fef* more nearly balanced</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is obvious that the dollar gap cannot be closed without a pronounced and continuing increase in Britain's exports to the United States Mid alee tv other dollar markets,, partwWly Canada, The British government had hoped that progress would be far and fast enough to show that, with KBP aid in the meantime, the sterling area's trade with the dollar countries could he balanced by 1952 at the pre-devnlnation change rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Far frotn an increase in dollar earnings, however, the sterling area suf. fered a severe reverse in the second quarter of 1949 when the gold and dollar deficit roae Io the annual rate of sterling £62S million—almost double the deficit of the first quarter. Thiis was partly due to increased payment* by Britain und other sterling area countries for imports of dollar goods, but also, in largo part, to a fall tn the dollar income of those countries, mainly due to three factors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One of these was the rumor and exportation of the devaluation of sterling whicili encouraged people tn whom the British owt-d dollars to press for payment, while those who owed the British dollars tended to delay payment. The second was a sharp fall both in the price and in the amount of sterling-area raw materials sold to the United States. This reduced the dollar earnings of the resit of the sterling area by one-fifth, t he commodity </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">r</span><span class="font11"> !no?t Heriously a Uetted being diamond % rubber, cocoa, tin, wool and jute. Thirdly, as a reaidt of more competitive selling conditions there waa a reduction in the shipments of British goods to dollar markets. The situatinn for Britain wae also aggravated by full-fwg </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">prints of Antorie&amp;s. niamtivdtetvtv </span><span class="font11">since the third quarter of 1948, whereas British prices were ri Mug till the turn of the year and showed little change until the devaluation of sterling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In mid-June the British government ordered a standstill of dal J ar purchases, and It wag later agreed with the other in embers of the sterling Commonwealth to aim in 1949-1950at a reduction in dollar imports to a level 25 percent below the 1945 rate. But a balance cannot be reflated </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">dimply</span><span class="font11"> by a ajrf </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font11"> dollar W-ports. The only effective way is by increasing dollar earnings through an expansion of exports to the United States and other dollar markets* and the British government's view has been that devaluation <sub>n</sub>f the pound tderliug is the only simple measure that will quickly and automatically enable British exporters and exporters in other parte of the 8lei’ll ng Commonwealth to get more business by selling their goods at the lower prices which devaluation forces upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">JSffectt of Dutvttluailon</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This immediate efifeet of dAvalnation —making British goods cheaper in dollar markets—brings ns to a consideration of the other consequences that follow, one of which is that dollar ^oorts are </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">dow<sup>t</sup></span><span class="font11"> more expensive for Britain to buy. At the B&lt;me time it must be stated that devaluatinn of sterling does not concern the intCTjiul value of the nations currently and prices ia the shops are tsfiri more or [ess the same, tor the internal value of the pound has not changed. But to whatever extent Britain imports from the dollar area, she now pays more dearly than before devaluation, and the prices of certain tsomTnoditics are bo</span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">und </span><span class="font11">to rise. For instance, the higher cost of raw materials and machinery used in industry bought from the United. Stalos</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">cannot but be reflected in higher prices for British manufactured goods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It is estimated that the 30-percent devaluation will mean an increase in the general cost of living of at least 5 percent In view, however, of the dire need of increasing exports and in due course a consequential shortage of goods on the home market, it is not at all improbable that shop prices in some instances may rise by 10 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">An interesting sidelight, with a very broad beam, on the extra expense in which devaluation now involves Britain is that if the present exchange rate remains unaltered an additional £475 million will be needed to repay the American loan (amounting to £1,000 million) granted in 1946, which is actually nearly double the cuts Mr. Attlee announced in his crisis speech to Parliament on October 24,</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">As to the expansion of Britain’s export trade, which was the primary objective of the government’s devaluation decision, the consequent lower selling price of British goods in the dollar markets may not produce the full result expected. It is true that they will be sufficiently price-attractive to the foreign buyer to encourage demand, hut just think what a great expansion of trade will be necessary now that the exchange rate of the pound is so much lower in relation to the dollar. Even to maintain the pre-devaluation amount of exports to dollar countries, a large increase in Britain's exports is now imperative. To still further expand is going to be a tough problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Parallel with this object is obviously increased production by British industry, and here we meet a situation which fairly bristles with difficulties. For a year dr so British industry generally has been working virtually at capacity and the only way left open for greater production so as to meet export needs is either by working longer hours or by more intensified work which in some cases may involve the installation and use of the most modem machinery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Here the position comes right up against trade union policy and practice, and although some of the leaders are anxious to support the government in its appeal for more productive effort, others at the moment are quite unconvinced, and the question of wages in relation to a longer working week is quite thorny. Another problem is that some industries, pottery for instance, not only are operating at full capacity but have already been working overtime to meet demand. This, of course, means that 4f Britain is to increase still further her exports to the dollar markets then some- articles now on sale in British shops will become very scarce in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Again, even if Britain were able to manufacture on a sufficiently large scale to sell abroad to such an extent as to bridge the dollar gap, can she be certain that the United States and other dollar countries will take what she has to offer? It is true that so far as the United States is concerned the Truman administration is prepared to reduce the tariff barriers which for so long have hindered the flow of goods from other countries, and that gesture for the encouragement of international trade is most welcdme to Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But what is going to be the attitude of American manufacturers who by reason of the devaluation of sterling will have to compete with the lower prices of British goods, and in any event apparently will have a more limited market than they formerly enjoyed under tariff protection? The rtiore one thinks about it, the more one finds that the policy of devaluation as a help to British trade is as much a gamble as it is a &quot;shot” in the arm for stimulating the body economic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Increased Cost of Imports</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Then when consideration is given to the other side of the trade equation^</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Britain’s imports, another serious prob' Jem looms up. Before devaluation Britain's purchases from the dollar area, chiefly food, tobacco and raw materials for industry, were about three times as heavy as her dollar sales. The decision of the British government to reduce American imports by 25 percent (about $400 millionj in 1950 is a realistic eontrihn-tion to the closing of the dollar gap, but it still leaves an overwhelmingly largy supply of imports which will now cost more in sterling than before devaluation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It requires no accountancy skill to see that this will impose an extra burden on industry which will have to pay more for its raw material from the dollar area and, together with the higher prices of other dollar commodities will mean a rise in the cost of Living. 0n October </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1’2 </span><span class="font11">Lord Hollenden, president of the Wholesale Textile Association, stated that prices of raw materials for the men's wear trade had already started to climb and tii nt, in view of the export demand, supplies in the shops, particularly of shirts, pajamas, socks and knitwear, were going to be scarce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Also with respect to the effect of devaluation in causing Britain to pay higher sterling prices for food and raw materials imported from dollar countries and also from olher countries which have not devalued by loss than the I&quot; a tied Kingdom, it should be noted that the British Ministry of Supply has already announced increases in prices of copper (up by about 30 percent), aluminium (20 percent), load (32 percent) and zinc (3d percent]. Other raw materials whose sterling prices have increased since devaluation include tin (up by about 30 percent), rubber (15-20 percent), wool (about. 20 percent) and American cation (over 40 percent). Bread and flour were the only majqr foods immediately affected by devaluation. Some further inrr&lt;-ns-ob may eventually take place in imported foods </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ns</span><span class="font11"> a re sub of the alteration in exchange rates, hut at the time of writing it is impossible to predict bow large they will he.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The effect of the increased import prices on manufacturing co^ts will, of course, offset to some extent the competitive advantage which (Inited Kingdom ex parts will derive from devaluation. Prices of imported materials are, however, estimated to represent not more than about one-seventh or one'eighth Of the prices of United Kingdom exports as a whole, and it is only in a few hut very important lines (notably nonferrous metals and manufactures, woolens and worsteds, and cotton yarns and manufactures) that higher raiv material costs may necessitate a major increase in sterling expert prices. Groups of British exports likely to bo rdntivriy little affected iu this way include machinery, vehicles, electrical goods, chemicals, pot-tcry and glass, and cutlery; in each of these groups imported materials represent about o percent or lees of export prices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Tourist Trade</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another angle from which the effeetB of devaluation may be viewed i? that of tourism. It is estimated that by the end of 1949 more than 135,1)00 visitors will have come from the United States to Britain, including persons in transit, and that jwrrdrjga from this particular traffic will reach $70 million. The British Travel Association hopes that next year dollar earnings from both die United States and Canada will reach $100 million, for the much lower rate of sterling is curtain to encourage more tourists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Devaluation, h owe vet-, while it should help to overcome previous complaints of high prices in Britain, is likely to lead to a lower rate of dollar spending by individual American tourists who obviously will get more for their, dollar. So it may be that the Travel Axsoria-tion’F estimate of Britain’s dollar cam tags from tourism next year is aome-wind optimistic. Another doubtful fao-.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">tor in regard tn tourist earnings is that with the new cuts in building in the government’&amp; new devaluation economic program the urgent problem of providing more hotel accommodation service may not be met For the British tourist devaluation, of course, mcane that Britons will find it much more expensive traveling to the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Curtailment of Government Spending</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The financial cuts announced on October 24 by the prime minister to meet the nation's economic needs are regarded as anything but adequate. It is generally considered that the total of £250 million stated by Mr. Attlee should have been at least double to meet the retrenchment requirements which the situation demanded. The city view is that the government is merely tinkering with the problem, and to biisinpRsmen a whole the extremely modest cute have been all the more surprising because of the serious warning given by Mr. Attlee and other ministers on the gravity of the situation, and which was abundantly emphasized immedintely before the cuts were announced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">To have thus prepared the pnhlic mind for a most severe pruning of government expenditure in various directions (which, let it be noted, the nation was randy to accept) and then to go only half way in that direction does seem to indicate a lack of true leadership and i? certainly wanting in that hoMneaa of action which the situation consequent on devaluation so fully demands. In the event the prime minister's statement produced an anticlimax.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Of the £250 million the heaviest cut is in capital expenditure, which is reduced by £140 million, to become fully effective in the second half of 1950. There will be a reduction in the housing program of £35 million annually, and a similar sum will be saved by a further restriction of private building. This means that instead of, say, 200,000 new permanent </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">JAJfUdBT</span><span class="font14"> 8. JP5P</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">dwellings next year there are to be about 180,000, the reduction being achieved bv halving the quota of 40,000 houses which would have been allowed to private interests, This, of course, adversely affects the Labor party’s social aims in housing. The present annual subsidy of £36 million on animal-feeding stuffs is to end next February, and there is also to be an adjustment in the prices of some less essential foods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Other savings will he affected by in-crentung by one penny the charge for school meals, and there m to be a charge of not more than one shilling on each proscription under the National Health Service. The Health Service prescription charge is flcnsihle and should prevent many unreasonable calls upon doctors and trivial demands of the chemist. It baa been suggested that in the more expensive items, such as spectnclftB, the government conld have saved a good deni more by charging, nay, ten ahilungs for each pair of spectacles, except in the case of pensioners and children. The small increase in the school meals seems justified, and it is estimated that parents will in future pay about £13 million instead of £11 million toward a total annual expenditure of about £39 million on meals at school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Outside the £250 million in cuts there is to be a small retrenchment in expenditure on defense al the annual rate of £30 million, but this is to be reviewed Inter when the future striirturc of the anned forces has been completed. As forecast by Sir Stafford Cripps, last July, a now dollar import program will reduce imports in the first half of next year to $600 million.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The nation received the announcement of the cuts quite coolly. The more one thinks about them the more one concludes that they are merely temporary expedients which put off to a later day the real shouldering of the nation’s financial and economic burdens. At least, that is what it appear? to be to the av-</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">erage citizen; However, Mr. Herbert Morrison, lord president ol‘ the Conned, speaking on October 27 in the closing debate on the cuts in Parliament, told the House that the present iiistaliment of cuts had been mode to serve notice on everyone that the government meant business about economy. Anyone, he went on, who imagines that the present list represented the end pt the government's effort was going to be undeceived before long.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">sanity. Bui meanwhile, what about the headache T</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It throbs and racks, undisturbed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Medical science has not much more than its own headache to offer. It has established special headache clinics in leading hospitals, but nut enough to take care of 12 ini Ilion, patients. It is exper* imenlbig with drugs, physiotherapy, vision correction and surgery. It is compiling a Talmud-thick theology trying to explain what causes headache and what can he done about headache. But as one baffled investigator attests, the chronic headache sufferer &quot;may find himself on an excursion to the ophthalmologist, neurologist, dentist, psychiatrist, osteopath and chiropractor. Thereupon he is X-rayed, massaged, analyzed, fitted with glosses, relieved of his turbinates and teeth, and too often emerges with his headache intact”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The supreme enigma halfling science is how to survey and correct the emotional life of the patient, because emo* tiunal unbalance is the familiar spirit that stirg up more head pain than any other factor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What Is « Headache?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Atp</span><span class="font14"> you surprised to hear that it seems to be anything else than the brain IhrobbtegF The brain is as insensate as &quot;so much boiled cereal”- Doctors have prodded the brain of volunteer victims undergoing surgery without anesthetics and (whether such victims under these circumstances can give reliable testi-</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">9</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">mony, don't ask) found that the headache seems to be, (1) pain in certain parts of the dura, a tough white tissue which covers the brain; for instance, the dura may be stretched by brain tumors, although this is rare. Or (2) action of pulsating veins upon pain areas of the scalp: dilation of the large cerebral blood vessels which have nerve fibers in them; the widening of important arteries in the neck may also contribute to or stir up a headache.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">There are said to be two general classes of headaches. One is called organic, when the headache is caused by some disease, infection or other physical disorder, The other is called psychogenic or emotional, when the trouble is emotional in origin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Not that organic and emotional headaches, can always be easily distinguished: they may overlap and agitate each other* Patients examined at the Mqntefiore hospital headache clinic in New York were found to be suffering from headaches to which emotional factors contributed in 95 percent of the cases; in 35 percent of the cases emotional disturbances were the sole cause of headache.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If it is the action of pulsating veins upon the paiu areas of the scalp that causes headache^ then it is no mystery why emotional disturbances cause so much headache. Any strong emotion— fear, anxiety, anger, hate, worry, guilt, tension—is a trigger that sets off that kind of agitation. Mr. and Mrs. Citizen of this swirling, panicky world, besieged by their everyday anxieties, frustrations and worries, getting too little sleep and generally overworked, are bull's-eye marks for the chronic headache*</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In case you have unfortunately fallen into the clutches of the head-racking fiend, or should encounter it, there is no sure method of self-diagnosis, of course* However, leading authorities have outlined the general characteristics of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">10</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">more prevalent types of chronic headache, which are summarized below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Characteristics of Chronic Headaches</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Psychogenic—Emotional. The most common headache. Although not generally so severe, it makes itself felt by a constricting clutch, starting at any point and spreading insidiously to the top and finally taking over the entire cranium, to settle down eventually in, perhaps, the frontal region. The victim may experience the sensation of wearing a tight hatband, or a feeling of pressure. He may feel lightheaded. His palms may sweat. Neck muscles may feel stiff and tender,</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Noting that the psychogenic case is precipitated during or after states of nervous tensions, investigators generally conclude that prolonged tenseness of the scalp muscles produces the pain. Besides the drugstore panaceas, enemas, lying down, scalp massages, modified chiropractic, or maybe a vacation, may help temporarily. But the permanent cure? Well, the victim will have to gaiu an insight into his conflicts and solve them, which many times is about as easy as jumping over the moon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A variation of the psychogenic headache is induced by general muscular tension. This is the kind that grows slowly, exasperatingly, as the day wears on, until you are suspended in a vise-like grip. Ask the tense, high-strung individual who can't relax or who uses shoulder and neck muscles a great deal for more details about this kind of headache. Temporary relief may come from rest, heat at the back of the neck, massage, loosening of the body's nerve centers. When spinal arthritis is the cause of the headache, the general ■ health must be improved, metabolic disorders corrected, fatigue and eyestrain must be avoided. But here again permanent relief requires learning to relax, to work without strain, to avoid anxiety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">AWAEE I</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Migraine.</span><span class="font11"> Well does the victim know it before it comes; it sends him an “aura” of warning. He, or twice as often it is she, notices, out of one corner of the eye, zigzag flashes of light, climbing sawteeth, luminous spirals or other blinding contortions. Back of the eyes and on one side of the head (migraine means “half a skull”) begins a dull, throbbing, sickening dolor. Bright light makes it worse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Commonly misnamed the menstrual, relaxation, Sunday, week-end and sick headache, migraine may come at any time, especially at “letdown” periods, such as on rest days or the first day of vacation. It may last an hour or a week. It tends to weaken in the evening hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What causes migraine? There is at least one theory in every’ sufferer. Some say allergy. Some, heredity. At any rate there is a personality factor involved. Migraine sufferers are almost invariably the hypersensitive type, persons who cringe inwardly over little things other people do not notice, the emotionally insecure, ambitious, tense, and, it must be added, stubborn, inflexible, resentful personalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Now what can be done for such unfortunates? About as much as can be done </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">with</span><span class="font11"> them. Various ergot preparations, like the aforementioned ca'f egone, may lessen the misery’, possibly at the risk of precipitating high blood pressure. Inhalation of pure oxygen, avoidance or reduction o* exposure of allergens, relaxing for half an hour in tepid baths, may tender some help, as a mirage helps the desert wanderer. But permanent relief calls for changes so drastic that the victim has just about to don a new personality, or at least seek new environmental factors. Cut the work routine. Develop a hobby. Reduce tension. Cross one bridge at a time, as it is reached. Learn to accept or avoid aggravating environmental circumstances. A change of attitude and habits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A variation of migraine is the brutal histamine headache. It wakens its victim after an hour or two of sleep with a boring, one-sided, excruciating pain in-•volving eyes, temple, neck and face. Histamine lasts less than an hour anil usually picks on people in their late 50’s. While it may be related to some allergic reaction, histamine is thought to be an accumulation of the chemical by that name in the blood. In most cases, sitting up in bed routs the torturer. Gradually increasing shots of histamine injected under the skin or into the veins desensitizes the pain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">High blood pressure. Here is another cranium-throbblr that usually attacks its victims in their sleep, during early hours of morning. The sleeper is gradually prodded into a torturous awakening by a growing sense of pain which may be anywhere in the head, varying from a dull ache to an intense pounding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When the doctors find out for certain what causes high blood pressure, then they will probably know more what to do. uhout the headache it causes. Until real relief comes, the self-respecting victim will try not to aggravate his already existing hypertension by fatigue or emotional upsets. A nervous shoek, hard effort, excitement or the like may rouse the horny oppressor though it has been absent all day. An icecap on the head, sitting up, walking around, drinking coffee, may help. Some people are relieved by sleeping with the head of the bed raised 10 inches or more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For permanent relief—that same plaintive refrain again: a call for the kind of life that avoids high blood pressure. Relaxation. Sedation. Rest. Diet. Removal of aggravating emotional </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">dif</span><span class="font11">-liculties. A better ordering of personal affairs. The kind of change that gives the victim a calm mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Nasal, There are two types. One is caused by acute sinusitis. The victim feels it with colds and upper respiratory .infections. It is a “sore-head” joy-killer that aches with a deep dull pain which is worsened by stooping over or shaking</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">the head, straining, coughing, a draft of cold air or alcohol. A frontal sinus infection makes itself felt by pain in the forehead, beginning at about nine in the morning and growing worse during daylight hours. Maxillary sinus causes early afternoon distress fn ’the forehead, cheek, face and teeth. The day-long sufferer will have sphenoid or ethmoid sinus infections, with pain between and back of the eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The other type of nasal headache, which is uncommon, is a by-product of chronic sinusitis, nasal obstruction, or the like. There is little to offer any nasal headache victim other than rest, heat, aspirin or the like, shrinking of membranes of the nose by vasocanatricting drops. Allergens aggravate some cases. In more serious cases of sinusitis the medico's procedure is irrigation or surgical drainage of the sinuses, or the removal of head growths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Besides these more prevalent types of chronic headache, there are at least 200 accountable causes for the ailment—stiff combs, eye trouble, constipation, anemia, infection, fever, allergies, tumor, alcoholism, stomach, kidneys, liver, muscle a—the symptoms of all are about the same. In short, the headache is-nature’s warning signal that something, emotional or organic or both, is in distress. Danger lurks behind the chronic headache. The victim should do something about it. He should not continually dose himself on drugstore jejune until ho hastens the destruction of his health and mind, or deadens the pain until a brain tumor has grown too big for the surgeon. On the other hand, there is no guarantee that headache specialists can work a cure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Frankly, the panacea for tile world's headaches calls for something higger than men and science can provide. It must be more than fresh air and sleep and diet. It is the kind of living atmosphere that produces stable and courageous personalities, where life is emotionally serene, free from tensions, fears, anxieties. What an eloquent dis-tress-eall for Jehovah's incoming new world of peace and tranquillity, wherein rejuvenating health will dispel out of existence forever all headaches and the maladies that cause them!- -Contributed.</span></p>

Warming and appetizing, nourishing and satisfying—that is trnup when it is made right and served right. But alas! so often soup is not made or served right. Sometimes it is lukewarm, watered down and as tasteless as the turnip &quot;soups&quot; served up in the Nazi concentration camps. Sometimes curdled, it is as repelling to Look upon us dish water, or, again, it is thick and lumpy, like a faulty batch of paperhanger’s paste. The housewife that turns out such discouraging failures as these usually ends up buying a can opener and some of the “57” varieties of tinned ku ups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">AU soups, and this includes the 10,000 fancy 4 to Frenchy soups, are com-Sosfid of no more than four basic Lugre-ients: stock, seasoning, vegetables, and garnishes. &quot;Stock<sup>1</sup>' is the liquid part, mostly water, that contains the esFence, juice and gelatin hoiled out of meat, poultry, fish or vegetables; it is simple to make. Take a lew pounds of lean veal ur beef, together with a knuckle or shinbone that is first broken open so that the marrow can escape, and place these in an enamel or stainless-steel put. Other metals give an undesirable “taste”. Add 1 quart (inure or less, depending on richness desired) of cold salted water to each pound of ment, nnd boil for 5 or 6 hours. Chicken, duck or turkey bones are, good additions to this stock. After boiling, strain, and ullow to cool, and then remove all or part of the hardened Tat from the top. This stock can be kept for Boverul days and used to make different soups. Other stocks can be made 1'rom lamb or ham bones. Oxtails make a favorite stuck. Rabbit, venison, goose, f rogs.cto., also produce suitable soup stocks. Fish, clams, oysters, shrimps and turtles make popular soups. Saving the water from cooked and canned vegetables and using it instead of plain water in the f’toek is good, since it adds extra fond values and flavor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The next steps in soup-making are al-must as simple as making the stock, for all that is needed is the addition of this or that, and the stock is transformed into an exciting bouillon, consomme, creamed or thickened soup. While soup is quite simple in its basic formula,, it is by no means a dull <sup>&lt;f</sup>cut and dried” affair. The greatest latitude is afforded the individual cook to express her artistic genius, especially in seasoning and flavoring the soup, .</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Fresh or dried basil, chives, lovage (wilh its celery-Jike taste), summer or winter savory, are only a few of the herbs for soup pots. A fine, bouquet is obtained with </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font14"> sprigs of parsley, 2 sprigs of thyme, 1 sprig of marjoram and bay leaf, all tied in a bag that is removed after cooking. Herbs should be added about J hour before the end of the cooking so that their goodness is not boiled away. Many spices also‘are used, the principal one being pepper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A word of caution t a dclictife-fasting soup can easily be spoiled, and often is, simply by oversea soiling it. However, if a soup is designed to be hot nnd spicy</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">in flavor, then do not skimp, but rather hit a high note with the sea.soning. Salt, a very important item, will ruin a soup if too much is used. But if by accident you get too much salt in the soup do not throw the whole away in a torrent of tears. All you have to do, unless you know a better way, is to slice up some potatoes, boil them in the soup a few minutes, and then fish them and the excess salt out together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Turning Stock into Soup</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font11"> plain stock with nothing added except a little seasoning is served to invalids, as broth or bouillon. Sometimes it is strained through fine cloth or cleared with egg white and egg shells. Stimulating, it is of little food value and is easily digested. A consomme is similar to a bouillon, but is made with less water, is richer and is more elegant in flavor. The many modifying agencies that may be added make available a great variety of consommes that serve well as appetizers before the heavier dinner courses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If, however, the soup is to be the principal dish or is to be a meal in itself, then it must have substantial additions of vegetables to give it not only flavor, but also body, substance and a satisfying amount of food value. Such a fortified soup may he either clear or thickened, the thickened ones being either creamed soups or purees. Vegetable soups are good examples of reinforced bouillons. The combination of vegetables, and the amount of each used, are usually determined by the odds and ends in the icebox or refrigerator. Onion, or ebive and leek, is greatly desirable in a savory soup. Celery, turnips and tomatoes are also important vegetables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If one has a choice of vegetables, then here is one suggested recipe: 1 quart canned tomatoes, 3 large carrots, 1 turnip, I .sliced onion, 2 diced potatoes, 3 chopped branches of celery, a handful of chopped cabbage leaves, $ cup canned corn and I cup of green beans or peas. Vegetables are either added at intervals which permit them to finish cooking at approximately the same time, or they are first fried in butter a few minutes and then placed in the soup to simmer for about two hours. The latter method makes a richer soup. If, instead of having a balance between a number of vegetables, a particular one gives a predominating theme, then the dish takes the name of that vegetable, as, for example, onion soup, broccoli soup, corn soup, tomato soup, mushroom soup, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Those soups made with peas, dried or fresh, lentils, beans of every sort, potatoes, pumpkin or squash, are usually called purees because the predominant vegetable is ruhbed through a sieve to make a soup having a thick consistency like heavy cream. A cup or two of tasteless soybeans can be nicely hidden away in a puree to add extra food value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another very important class of soups are those that are thickened by creaming. Originally, a creamed fish soup was called “bisque”, but today the term is applied to other creamed soups. Real cream or rich milk is best to use for delicious cream of almond, cream of corn, cream of chestnut, cream of chicken, cream of asparagus, cream of spinach, cream of tomato, and cream of mushroom soup. But most families cannot afford to use expensive cream. Hence, most recipes call for white sauce as the thickening agent, made of flour and water or flour and milk. The amount of milk or sauce to be added depends on the quantity of vegetables present and what consistency the artistic cook desires. From | cup to 14 cups of cooked vegetables to 2 or 3 cups of thickener are the usual proportions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Garnishes Complete the Soup</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">You may think of garnishes as super-fluoms additions that go only with “ritzy” soups; but this is not so. No soup is complete without proper garnishes, no mat-</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">ter how simple it is or under what humble circumstances it is served. This is because the garnishes are integral parts of the soup, performing the twofold function of both pleasing the eye and gratifying the taste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">There aie many types of garnishes. Dry crackers or various crispy croutons give excellent contrast with the wetness of the Roup, Cnhea of broad may he toasted, or browned in butler or meat dripping*. Or they may be spread with peanut butter and oven-browned. Italian pastes, such as elbow macaroni, spaghetti or vermicelli arc excellent gar niehet in a simple bouillon soup. Noodles too, and “alphabets”, are good. Boiled barley or rice, or oatmeal, farina and tapioca are also tt.^ed extensively in soups. Try puffed wheat or rice, or vari ous cereal crispies, or if you want to serve a novel, yet a pleasing dish, place hot buttered popcorn on creamed corn soup just before it is to be paten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Vegetable* are very tllicient garnishes to give delightful color and flavor to clear soups. A few slices of yellow carrotfl, hits of red pimientn, pieces of green pepper or asparagus tips will lift an otherwise coniine u soup up to a chef's specialty. Red tomatoes and beets also have great value as garnishes. Want to use np that extra hard-boiled e^gin the icebox? Then press it through &amp;&nbsp;sieve and sprinkle it iu the soup just before serving. One or two beaten raw egg yolks added after removing a soup from the heat will improve its color and crcnmy richness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Besides those used as seasonings, many herbs are fine garnishes. Parsley and chive are popular in vegetable soups. Dill, for fish soups, and spearmint leaves in a lamb or mutton soup, do very welL Grated cheese added just before serving fives richness to any creamy soup. Try it in an onion soup the next time. Cheese sticks or toasted cheese eubea can be used to garnish many soups. Never overlook left-over poultry from the Sunday dinner. Dices of it in the soup pot are wonderful. If bean or lentil soup, or creamed celery, mushroom or asparagus soup is on the menu, then do not forgot to garnish it with sliver a of smoked ham or sauRQge, or pieces of crispy bacon. This little trick will raise the family's praise al least an octave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Whipped cream, marshmallows, fruits and mats served in soup may soom farfetched, hut they arc among the must delightful of all garnishes. Cream whipped with salt, pepper, cayenne, tabasco or with orange or lemon rind, and then floated on each serving of Roup, is most effective. Marshmallows, toasted or not, and dusted with paprika are also good. In the line ul* fruits, try diced, oilrich avocados in a consomme. Or if a duck soup is loo rich cut it with raisins or currants. Sliced hnnnnns browned in butter will take the place of potatoes in the not, or as a special treat serve the family hut cherry soup. There are also many recipes for wine and fruit Roups for serving cold during the hot summer months, and in these apples, apricots, grapes, cranberries, pineapple, peaches, oranges, coconut and many kinds of berries are used to good effect. And do not overlook the exciting possihilitieR of garnishing soups with nuts. A few pine nuts, or shredded Brazils, almonds or pecans that are first rousted, ur poppy seeds, or bite of eouked chestnuts in a creamed soup work wonders. With finch, try a small dash of nutmeg too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Save the fruit and jelled soups for hot summer days and serve them arctic cold. Serve clear soups piping hot before heavy dinner courses. Furves and bisques are for family lunches. Chowders, gumbos and pepper pots arc main supper dishes. So numerous the recipes and materials, so simple the procedure —why, any amateur, with no more equipment than a pot on a hot stove, a spoon with which to taste the broth, and a little know-how, can turn out a different soup every day of the year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font25">R</span><span class="font11">OMAN Catholicism poses as the spiritual antagonist of materialistic communism. From her safe pulpits in democratic lands She blasts forth a gale of invective against the Red menace. One would think her adamant in her position and ready'to hold it at any cost. Adding to this impression the pope hurls an excommunication, decree at her millions of Catholic communists. But that showy purge of Red from Catholicism is never carried out. Courageous w<sup>T</sup>ords turn cowardly when faced by the foe at close quarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Do you. recall the much-publicized resistance of the Catholic clergy to state control of their church in Czechoslovakia? Would you even dream such advertised courage would ever quail? For weeks and even months before the new law was to go into effect.these highly touted clerical resisters of communism were applauded and back-slapped by a foolish Western press, fanning in its desire to tickle religious egos. Then just one week before the law was to take effect the blown-up bubble of clerical bravado collapsed. On October 25 the Cathr olic Church in Czechoslovakia lost its nerve, or rather abandoned its bluffing, and said the priests there, would swear loyalty to the communist government, accept salary-increases from the state, submit to control of church finances and administration, and bow to the requirement of state approval of appointments of priests for church posts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Now the cry may charge forth from Catholic mouths that the foregoing paragraph omits mention of an important point, namely, that loyalty w<sup>r</sup>as sworn to</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">the Red state, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">with reservations.</span><span class="font11"> So to be fair this paragraph will consider those reservations. In reporting this Catholic<sub>:</sub> clergy retreat the New York </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font11"> October 26, 1949, said the priest is required by the law to take an oath that “I shall be loyal to the Czechoslovak Republic and its people’s democratic regime and shall not do anything that would be against its interests, security and unity”. The priests were to add the oral or written reservation “unless it is in contradiction to the laws of God and the church and the rights of man”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another paragraph is needed to show what happened to these face-saving reservations of the clergy. On November 1 the new law went into effect, and it became time for the priests to swear their loyalty oaths, with reservations. But alas! even the courage to make the timid reservation vanished at showdown time, for on that day a high church dignitary-announced that this qualification had been abandoned and that instead the priests would merely add to their oath these words: “Since I am convinced that the government would never ask anything which would be contrary to the laws of God or human rights.” (New York </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font11"> November 4, 1949) What an amazing and appalling thing to say!' Or do they even know what they are saying? </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Those Roman Catholic clergy now swear on oath that they are convinced that a communist government would ask nothing contrary to God’s laws or to human rights!</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19500108_files/g_E_19500108-6.png" alt="" style="width:427pt;height:278pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">And now to ask, Why did these compromising clergy make such a miserable retreat after the world expected so much</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">from their proclaimed courage? Let the excuses come from an authoritative source, and as reported in the New York </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font17"> of October 27, 1949:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Emphasis was laid on the fact that acceptance of the government's church control laws did not mean that the episcopate “has </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">com</span><span class="font14">pletely abandoned the principles it always fought for so decisively&quot; an editorial in </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">I'Osscrratore Romano</span><span class="font14"> said, The reason for the episcopate’s decision must be sought in the concern it felt over the fate of 7,000 members of the clergy who would otherwise become the target of government persecution, it was qaid. The compromise, if it can be so called, has been made on “political&quot; and not religious grounds, Vatican circles added. . . . They added that the latest reports they had received from Czechoslovakia had outlined government plans for the construction of a concentration camp with 800 beds especially designed for recalcitrant priests while there were other indications that a new wave of reprisals by means of tortures and other forms of intimidation was tu be expected in the clergy’s open defiance to state laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Blessed are those who suffer persecution for Christ’s sake. All who live godly in -Christ Jesus will suffer persecution, Christ foretold it for Christians. No real Christian will run from it. If any asks a Christian to ilee from it, that one speaks for Satan, Remember when Christ Jesus told His followers of the severe persecution He must undergo? And do you recall how Peter reproved Jesus and said such things should not happen to Him? Listen to Jesus’ reply: “Get behind me, you Satan! You are a hindrance to me! Your outlook is not God’s but man’s/’ —Matthew 16: 21-23, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">And it will not do for these compromisers to try to wriggle out by claiming the retreat is on political and not religious grounds. For the state to project itself into the church and dictate its internal policies, control church money and administration and appointments, and finance the church as a state tool is certainly invading religious grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Later on the Czechoslovakian bishops apparently realized that the oath that a communist government would not act contrary to the law of God was false, for in a statement dated November 17 they said their “conciliatory directives” had failed to effect a compromise, that the control laws were “against the law of God”, and that “a religious fight could arise”. The Czech word the bishops used for “fight” was “boj”, which may also be translated “struggle” or “conflict”. Press headlines, wanting more sensationalism, called it “civil war”. (New York </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font17"> December 5) But the bishops did not withdraw their instruction that priests take loyalty oaths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">True Christians Resist</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In contrast, note Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany, </span><span class="font17" style="text-decoration:underline;">They held four dis</span><span class="font17"></span><span class="font17" style="text-decoration:underline;">trict assemblies in Germany in 1949</span><span class="font17">, The one to’ serve” the vritnesses ni’the* communist-dominated Eastern zone was arranged forJjiHieBritish sector^ofJBer-lin. </span><span class="font17" style="text-decoration:underline;">Qui</span><span class="font17">etly7^iglyrs^ciarTraIns^wer?en-Tis’ted?' uYiew Tburs^beTore* departure they were canceled without cause, leaving hundreds of witnesses stranded at railroad stations.

<p><span class="font25">J</span><span class="font11">UST smell that air, Dear Reader. See that sky? Can you feel the rich warmth of that sun? The day has dawned bright and clear, and you are in Santa Ana, the city second in size and importance of El Salvador, the smallest of the republics of Central America. Santa Ana is mentioned by historians as early as 1576. This lovely old city of 85,000, steeped in Spanish ages, lies in a valley the name of which means “place abundant with women”. It is also a popular cookfighfing center, and our chief concern for today is just that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For almost two years we have wanted to visit the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Cancha</span><span class="font11"> to watch the fights, but something has always prevented our going; so, Mr. Reader, we are glad you are coming- with us, as we will be overjoyed to show you the sights on the way. This little English Ford is ours. There are only four of us. so there will be plenty of room. Please sit here in the front seat, so you can see better, but hold on tightly, because in high gear wc are going to send chickens and dogs flying for their lives, and sometimes pigs too. We are in a hurry, for our watches show that the fights have already started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">By the way, do you see those roosters staked out on the side of the road? They are fighting cocks, and they are carefully tied just out of reach of their neighbor for a good reason. If they were to get within biting distance of each other, there would be plenty of feathers flying, and some valuable birds would get hurt.-. The Salvadoreans </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">carry their cocks </span><span class="font11">wrapped up tightly in straw mats so that only the head and tail can he seen protruding from the ends of the roll. Look quickly as we pass; there goes a man with one now. See how he has rolled a piece of cord in with his cock so as to make a shoulder strap for his bundle. He has a cock hanging from each shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The sun is blazing- down </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">hot</span><span class="font11"> now, and the dusty road soaking up the heat glows w<sup>T</sup>hite in contrast with the green of the jungle growth on either side. You will notice that we have just left the city, and that high board fence ahead encloses the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Cancha de Gallos,</span><span class="font11"> which simply means cockpit. Cockfights are very popular in El. Salvador; but the excitement of the fight is not the only attraction. There is another—betting. Sometimes thousands of colons are exchanged during one of these fights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Cockfights had their probable origin in Mexico and were later carried to-Europe, where they became popular in many countries, especially in England, where the Royal Cockpit enjoyed much popularity.Later Spain, helped tp spread it through the Americas, where the fighting and breeding of cocks became a very well-developed art. In Spain, in the early history of the sport, the cocks were fought with no other weapons supplied them than those given by nature; but as we shall soon sec, the Americans have devised far moire lethal means for drawing blood and insuring a mortal wound in the fighting birds. Even the ancient Greeks were cockfight enthusiasts. Records show that they had developed breeding and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">training</span><span class="font11"> io a very high degree. One practice was to feed garlic and on-</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">ions to the fighters to enhance their natural combative instincts. The sport is cruel and is frowned upon in most countries today by the cultured people and in some countries, such as the United States, there are laws prohibiting cockfights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Well, we have finally arrived, and will you look at all of those cars lined up in front! They are mostly expensive American makes too, as you will notice, testifying to the relative wealth of the owners who spend their Sundays here. The man at the gate has given us permission to enter as visiting observers, so we need not worry about paying or showing membership cards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Now, then, once through the gate, we are just part of the crowd. Wouldn't yon judge there to be about forty or fifty men Here? Notice how this high board fence forms a square patio arrangement. It must be at least seventy feet square. There along that hack wall in those cages are the cocks to be fought today. Isn't it nice and shady in here? Those two gnarled trees over by the fountain, where those men are washing that bloody cock, are avocado trees, and that giant, majestic one in the corner is a ceiba. Its shade almost covers half the enclosure. That tall neat tree with the narrow leaves is a mango. And what could that odd, square building in the center of the grounds be? It certainly is not much of a building—just a wooden roof built over this blockshaped, concrete base. It must be the fighting ring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">So this is the cockpit? It is composed of a simple, smooth, dirt floor made square by a board enclosure of about, waist height Look, over to our left in those special box seats; whom would you guess those three men in straw hats to be? You are right; they are the judges. All decisions as to weight and size of the cocks are decided upon by them, and they are final word in any dispute that arises. The ring is about twenty feet across, and to our extreme right you can see where the official bets are made; that man with the felt hat seated in the wire cage is the cashier.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19500108_files/g_E_19500108-9.png" alt="" style="width:146pt;height:222pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">By the way, can you see wbo that is waving to us from across the pit? Wliy, of course, it is our old friend Joaquin. From his gestures and from his position in the ring, we know that he is the owner of that fine bird in front of him with the yellow and green plumes, and this bird is one of the next fighters. The two owners and the referee are the only three men allowed in the pit during the fighting. They are handing the referee something from that blind, boxlike cage. It is a cock, but see how he is trussed tightly in that leather harness? He can move only his neck and head. The referee is tantalizing the two fighters by thrusting this third cock first into the face of one and then into the face of the other. Note how angry they are; they are really fighting mad. The referee’is finished now and the fight must be about to start, but no, wait; the crowd is shouting “Feathers! Feathers!” The referee is returning with the harnessed cock. Look, he is permiting the angry birds to bite and snap at each other, pulling feathers from their necks and heads. The crowd is now satisfied. All is calm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Fight</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Ready? There they go! Do you follow that explosion of feathers, legs, and fiercely biting beaks? Watch how they stab and tear with their spurs in mortal combat. One can almost feel the shock of the fight as they meet in midair. They are sparring for the second lunge. See how they circle beak to beak with their wings outstretched? See how their neck plumes stand out forming a ring around their heads! There they go a second time!</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But what is this! Both birds have fallen to the dirt apparently locked together The three men are now bent over the squirming roosters. The crowd is breath* lessly waiting. The referee under the scrutiny of the owners is gently withdrawing the foot of Joaquin's cock out from under the wingpit of the other bird. Would you look at that! No wonder they could not separate themselves. Those cocks have long razor-edged, steel spurs bound to their right legs, and the referee has just removed one from where it was imbedded in live flesh. Blood is now flowing freely from ^the wounded cock. Surely this cannot last much longer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The owners are living the fight themselves. The crowd is now beside itself with excitement. Jeers and cheers are flying in rapid Spanish on every hand. Joaquin is wiping off the beak of his bird as does the other owner too. See how they spit on the steel spurs bo as to help them cut. Notice how they are pressing their mouths against the roosters' backs; they are blowing warm air at the base of the cocks' necks to give them strength. Now the birds are placed about three feet apart with a wood shield in between to keep the birds from seeing each other until the proper time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Now, the referee has removed the partition. The cocks have met in full flight. Again and again they fly up. See how they kick out with their feet time after time. What a cruel and horrible sight! Their feathers are soaked with blood, but still they continue to fight despite their crippled condition. See how the bloody razors rip into the flesh of their opponent. But wait! One bird is dead, felled as if by a shot. The spur passed right through his neck. Mad with rage and unable to free himself, the winning cock has to be torn from his vanquished enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Once again calm comes to the arena, and the man in the felt hat is busy changing money with the long Line of men in front of his cage. See these men entering the ring! There are six of them, and each one hopes to match his rooster in the next fight. See how they strut the cocks before the betters. Observe how the wage-makers are judging the cocks for size and atrength. The betters determine largely which birds will fight, for if a match is uneven or unpopular with the crowd, very little money would be bet, with a resulting financial failure. Oh, ob, there seems to be a dispute as to what </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the cocks weigh,</span><span class="font17"> One of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font17"> judges is leaving now to supervise the weighing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Incidentally, have you been watching that man over there with the wide grin! He wants our attention. He is saying, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">“Vamos dies/'</span><span class="font17"> There you are, Mr. Reader ; he is inviting you to bet ten pesos on the next fight. This is your chance; want to bet? No! Then we will wag our finger at him like this. Ho, now he says, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Vamos veinte”</span><span class="font17"> He thinks we refused because the bet was too low; nevertheless, we will soon have a chance to explain, because here he comes our way. Why, of course, now we know who he is; we met him in Guatemala last year. Remember! He says they are preparing the cocks for the next fight, and if we would want to see how it is done, we will have to hurry. Just around to the side of the building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Selecting the Knives</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Look at that cock! Isn't he a fine bird! Our friend is explaining that this rooster was imported from the United States, His owner is certainly proud of him. It is said that he has never lost a fight. But what is that long leather case lined with red velvet! Our Guatemalan says that it contains the knives which are bound to the cock’s leg. How many knives do you count! There must be at least ten of them, and each one is of a different length and weight. Look closer to see how sharp they are. See how their sharp double edge curves to imitate the natural contour of the cock’s own spur. That small metal bridge at one end is made to fit exactly over the rooster’s leg. See how they have removed the natural spur of the right leg, leaving only, a small, horny stump as a &quot;base for the steel knife? No wonder these fights are so bloody and deadly. That knife is sharp as a razor and can cut both ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Can you understand our friend’s Spanish? He is telling you that great care must be exercised in selecting the knife'for the bird, because a knife that is too long will bind with the bird’s other leg, leaving him helpless to his enemy. The betting odds are all wild this North American bird, but our wise friend has just whispered that we should not bet on him, because he is going to lose the fight. He says that the owner has given his bird a knife that is to'o long. We will desist from betting, but lets hurry to our seat again, as the birds are now being returned to the arena for the fight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Native v». Foreigner</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">That giant, yellow bird must be the native cock. See how his spur is covered by a small leather sheath until fight time. Hear how he crows with confidence; he reminds one of a boxer as he bows to the audience. Now they are bringing in the foreign rooster. This should be a very close match. There is the bell, and the birds are together in the pit. Did you catch that maneuver? The American bird, instead of flying up to meet his opponent, squatted down cleverly, letting the yellow rooster pass harmlessly over his head. He does it again. Both birds change sides, and once again the yellow bird passes harmlessly over its foreigu enemy. Hear the crowd as it screams for blood. The native rooster is by now thoroughly enraged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Now for the first time they meet in full flight. Listen to the flutter of their wings as they come together. See</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">how they lash out with their feet as they hang on their wings almost two feet off the ground? But hark! The American bird is hurt. The crowd is stilled. Sure enough, our broad-wmiling friend was right; the American cock’s spur is too long and he is wounding his own leg. See how he binds himself as he tries to strike out in defense? The poor thing now seems to know that he is doomed. Notice how he sits bleeding and gasping for breath as he waits for each savage onslaught'from his opponent. But true to his blood, he never thinks of running. Now both birds have fallen to the floor of the pit, and the native cock is holding his stricken enemy in his beak and is wickedly tearing him with his razor spur. Those lethal blows have done their work, for that bell was the judges signal to stop the fight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cruelty’8 End</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Witness how the poor dying rooster quivers in nervous spasms as he is carried, dripping blood, from the arena. His owner is very, very sad, for three thousand colons were lost on this fight alone; but our friend is still smiling. Look at his fist full of money! That makes one hundred colons he has won today, and now he is ready to go home, and so are we.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The dirt floor of the pit is now stained a deep muddy red, and there are two small pools of blood near the exit gate. Such abuse and cruelty to Jehovah’s creation will not exist in the new earth. One is reminded of the words of Isaiah, “They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.” What a peaceful time that will be! Just a moment,</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Mr. Reader, and we will help you FV to catch your bus for the capital.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Control Your Spirit</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">HE word </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">spirit</span><span class="font17"> may have reference </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">to a spirit person,</span><span class="font17"> ibmay </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mean</span><span class="font17"> the life force that animates a creature, it may indicate Jehovah's active force by which He performs His will, or it may be used to mean the mental disposition or frame of mind of a person. The word is used with all these meanings in the Scriptures. In the discussion that fob lows it is used to refer to the mental disposition. It is very essential for the Christian to be able to exercise strong control over his spirit or frame of mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">* Proverbs 25:28 reads: “He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls.” That is, he has no control over the disposition of his mind. Every passing circumstance has an elf oct upon his frame of mind and he cannot direct his course of action according to the fixed rules of righteousness of God’s Word. He yields to temptations, the pressures, the stimulations to selfish conduct and evil-doing that play upon him in his various surroundings. He is excitable and is quickly roused to unreasonable anger, with outbursts of speech and action which are not tp good effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Thus he is disarmed and unprotected against the invasion of the demons of the spirit of this world, and is easily taken captive by forces and powers that issue forth from sources other than from God, He is uncertain, unreliable, and quickly turned out of the way of righteousness. As it is written: “He that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. ... A double minded man is unstable in all his ways ”—James 1:6-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The same Hebrew word </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">(ruach)</span><span class="font17"> translated spirit in the above proverb is translated </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">mind</span><span class="font17"> at Proverbs 29:11, which reads: “A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards ” For this reason the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">American Standard Version</span><span class="font17"> renders it: “A fool uttereth all his anger; but a wise man keepeth it back and still eth it.” And </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham's</span><span class="font17"> reads: </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>if</sup>All his</span><span class="font17"> anger </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">doth</span><span class="font17"> a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">dullard let</span><span class="font17"> go, but a wise man by keeping it back stilleth it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The fool has no mastery over his own spirit. The anger or enraged frame or disposition of mind which he feels rising within him he lets explode without regard for consequences. For that reason he acts </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">foolishly, and the results</span><span class="font17"> are those of foolishness. The spirit within him is in itself invisible to onlookers. Yet it is a driving force within him. Hence at first it may cause the fool to take on an angry countenance, bis blood leaving his face, his lips becoming livid. Then, on top of Ihis visible effect of such spirit, it vents itself in violent language and actions to foolish effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The wise person has control over his spirit, including its quality of anger. He knows that thoughtless action wall do no good and may displease the Lord. He takes thought for consequences and carefully weighs what will result if he gives way on the spot to anger. He feels anger, because there is occasion for it; but he realizes that to act instantly while in that disturbed or indignant frame of mind might cause harm rather than good* Hence he exercises self-control, with knowledge of God's will and with endurance of the anger-provoking factors dr events; and he holds himself in from careless, unrestrained expression of it. With holding it in there comes to </span><span class="font17" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font17"> power, particularly if he looks to his great Helper, Jehovah God. At length he is able to still his anger and to reason clearly and then to act according to the line of God's will and for the best interests of all Concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">He sees it is well not to harbor anger over too long a time, because the anger might harden him into an unwise mode of action, so committing sin. Ephesians 4: 35-27 warns against this, saying to members of Christ's church or “body&quot;: “We are members one of another. Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: neither give place to the devil ” The wise servant of God. will seek to still his anger as promptly as possible and then proceed with a sober, temperate mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In harmony with the above is Proverbs 17:27,38: “He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit”; or, according to the marginal reading, of </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">“a </span><span class="font17">cool spirit”. “Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding” (See </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">American Standard Version.)</span><span class="font17"> The man with knowledge of God's Word should not let words fly loosely, and in a torrent, especially when perturbed. If, with knowledge, he has understanding of his relationship with God and of his proper place in the Theocratic organization, he will not let the beat of anger or vexation overpower him. He will endeavor to keep cool and balanced in thought. With such a disposition or spirit he can excel or master the conditions, the set of circumstances that would drive the foolish person into sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It is well said: “He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that is hasty [shortl of spirit exalteth folly.” (Proverbs 14: 29) Being disposed to hasty or thoughtless action when stirred up leads to the committing of foolishness, specifically injurious to himself. Never checking himself to look ahead to what may be the outcome of unbridled speech or conduct, he acts the way he is disposed to under the unsettling conditions and persists in doing what is unwise. Thus he exalts or carries away folly, and is sure to abound in transgressions. “An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression.” (Proverbs 29: 22) The best remedy for such a disposition is the discipline and counsel of the great Lord and Ruler. Hence parents are instructed thus: “Ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath [or, do not irritate your children]: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.” —Ephesians 6:4; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Emphatic Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Those who regard the wisdom of God remember the proverb: “Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall. Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud. He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; aud he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.” (Proverbs 16:18,19,32) The wise prefer to keep company with the lowly, those low in their own eyes, because they recognize Jehovah God and Christ Jesus as “The Higher Powers”. Only thus do the wise gain the favor or grace of the Lord God; for He resists the proud. In the battle of Armageddon He will spoil those who have unrighteously spoiled the peoples of earth and persecuted His witnesses, whereas He will raise up His dowh-trodden and despoiled servants and beautify them with a blessed place in the righteous “world without end”.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font24"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Tickey’s Day</span></h6>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">®y * Awake !** mrupaadent to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;BiiiiiTJula</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>A WAKE! Awake! Awaker These</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font14">are the first words Tiekey hears each morning as his senses stir and he sleepily opens his eyes. It is about 5:30 a.m, and the “police-boy” is walking through the African kraal shouting in a fine resonant voice to awaken his master's workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Tickey can just see the faint light from Hie sky through his one window, a hole in the hut about the size of a saucer. He nudges hie wife, who dutifully scrambles up, swiftly slips on a simple cotton dress and starts to got the fire going. She has no matches, so she has to hurry to a neighbor, who gives her a glowing cinder with which she starts a fire. A primitive open fireplace in the center of their hut holds the ashes of last night's fire, and quickly she heats water for her hushand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Tickey, Bleeping in the hnff as usual, has now gotten up and put on his khaki Rhorts and shirt. Sitting on the only stool, he watches the smoke from the fire rising np and filtering through the conical grass roof. That’s the only place it can go through, as apart from the peephole and the doorway there is no other opening in the circular hut. His hut is small, maybe 8 feet in diameter, and Tickey made it from stakes of wood plastered with mud. Inside, mud was smoothed over the wall and left to dry. The floor was made in the same way </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">an</span><span class="font14">d stamped down till hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Now the river water is warm enough for Tickey to rinse his head and hands. His beard is about a week old, so he finds his safety-razor blade and scrapes away at his whiskers till his fingers tell him they have been removed. He takes out his toothbrush, which consists of nothing more than a chip of special bark frayed at one end into the semblance of a hrnsh and with it he rubs away at his strong white teeth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Remembering that he hoe to be at work at 6 a-m. he now hurries to the tobacco fields. His hardened feet are not sensitive to the hard ground. If a thorn happens to penetrate the thick epidermis he can dig it out with another thorn. With his fellow laborers he makes his way to his master's fields and plucks the tobacco leaves for 3 hours. At 9 a,m. it is getting hot. Gratefully the gan^s seek shelter from the scorching rays, in the barns, where, under the supervision of a &quot;bossboy”, the tobacco leaves are tied into bunches and hujig up to dry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">At midday work stops for an hour’s break. Tickey up til! now has had nothing to cat. As he Bits under a tree in the shade he is glad to see his wife come along with refreshment. It is the usual meal. She has made a porridge of mcalie meal (maize flour), a good thick per ridge, which she has put into a wooden plotter made from </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">muahamba.</span><span class="font14"> In a separate earthen howl are some cooked beans and a little savory. Tickey and his usual friends wash their handt? and gather round on their haunches, eating away at each one's offering until their bellies are full. They eat with their fingers, taking a dollop of the porridge from the platter, rolling it into a bail, soaking it in the gravy and then popping it into the mouth. Waler or perhaps some refreshing sweet beer helps the porridge down. One o’clock comes all too quickly and it is work once more until sunset.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The tired workers line up for their daily ration of food—a pound of mealie meal and a cup of beans. Onee a week they also get some meat. Tickey has to buy food for his family, and this he gets from the native store on the highway. There he can spend his monthly wages of 25 shillings. With his rations balanced on his woolly head Tickey walks home as the westering riui disappears on the horizon. He feels the need of a bath, and,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">being a clean soul, he gets ready. In the kraal is a grass-built enclosure specially for this. His wife brings him some water, and. this he scoops up and pours over his body. Today there is no soap, so he vigorously rubs his bronze skin till clean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Refreshed he goes over to the kitchenhut where his neighbors are eating already. His woman, carrying baby Sixpence on her back, brings along his food —same porridge and savory as before— and he happily eats this while gossiping and laughing with his friends. Only men are there, as the wives have already eaten with the children. Tickcy wonders what sort of man Sixpence is going to be. He smiles as he thinks of the name his baby has. Shortly after its birth a relative brought the small silver coin for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span class="font11">baby. The name Sixpence pleased the mother, and so the child was named.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Tickets wandering mind returns to his circle of friends. Last evening they danced and sang in the village, but all seemed content tonight to sit on the ground and chatter. Tomorrow will be Sunday and there is no work on the farm. He is invited to join a beer party tomorrow, but he remembers that he has bought a copy of the “New Testament” in his own language.
