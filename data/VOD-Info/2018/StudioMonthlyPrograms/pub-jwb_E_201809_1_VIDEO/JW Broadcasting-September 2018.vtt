‎Welcome to JW Broadcasting. 

00:00:04.287 --> 00:00:07.390 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What do we have for you
on this month’s program?

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.527 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We’ll hear the story of Cecil Goff,

00:00:10.527 --> 00:00:15.331 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎an elder and regular pioneer 
with over 80 years in Jehovah’s service.  

00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:18.368 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What valuable lessons from his experience

00:00:18.368 --> 00:00:22.138 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎can you apply to your life and ministry?

00:00:22.138 --> 00:00:23.807 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Whether we are young or old,

00:00:23.807 --> 00:00:27.677 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎how can we make good decisions 
when choosing entertainment? 

00:00:27.677 --> 00:00:32.082 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In this dramatization, 
we’ll see how a young brother named Danny

00:00:32.082 --> 00:00:34.484 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎learns the value of sowing

00:00:34.484 --> 00:00:37.320 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎what is wholesome in his mind. 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.490 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Has a challenge in your life 
ever been so severe

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.959 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that you felt overwhelmed? 

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:45.428 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When anxiety stirs within us,

00:00:45.428 --> 00:00:47.430 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎this new music video

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.967 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎can reassure us 
of Jehovah’s loving support. 

00:00:52.602 --> 00:00:57.107 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This is JW Broadcasting for September 2018.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.064 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We start this month 
with the story of Brother Cecil Goff.

00:01:21.064 --> 00:01:23.933 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Cecil is 99 years old

00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:27.537 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and has served Jehovah for over 80 years. 

00:01:27.537 --> 00:01:31.007 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He’s spent many of those years 
in full-time service. 

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:33.676 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He had the privilege 
to serve at Brooklyn Bethel,

00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:37.413 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as a circuit overseer, 
as a Gilead-trained missionary,

00:01:37.413 --> 00:01:40.583 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and as a branch overseer in Cuba. 

00:01:40.583 --> 00:01:42.685 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As you watch his interview,

00:01:42.685 --> 00:01:45.088 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎try to determine why he’s convinced

00:01:45.088 --> 00:01:48.324 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that his life 
in Jehovah’s service was more rewarding

00:01:48.324 --> 00:01:51.628 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎than anything the world had to offer.

00:01:51.628 --> 00:01:55.799 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎My name is Cecil Joseph Goff.

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.902 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I began to lose eyesight in the ’70’s.

00:01:58.902 --> 00:02:00.937 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I can’t see to read or anything.

00:02:00.937 --> 00:02:03.373 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I see only peripheral vision.

00:02:04.674 --> 00:02:09.012 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I was playing in a country band 
at a very young age.

00:02:10.246 --> 00:02:14.818 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, I played the tenor banjo, 
tenor guitar, and I played the mandolin.

00:02:15.418 --> 00:02:17.687 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It was my life.

00:02:17.687 --> 00:02:20.690 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And yet, when I began reading and studying,

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.926 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎really, I wanted to stick with that,

00:02:22.926 --> 00:02:25.161 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and I left the band.

00:02:25.161 --> 00:02:27.163 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I started pioneering,

00:02:27.163 --> 00:02:31.868 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and then they assigned me 
to Texarkana, Texas.

00:02:31.868 --> 00:02:35.672 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Another brother and I were stopped

00:02:35.672 --> 00:02:37.740 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as we were holding the phonograph up,

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.476 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and I was playing it for a lady at the door.

00:02:40.476 --> 00:02:44.948 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Why, here about 15 or 20 men surrounded me.

00:02:44.948 --> 00:02:46.683 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I asked him, “How did you enjoy it?”

00:02:46.683 --> 00:02:48.384 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And he said: “That’s not the question.

00:02:48.384 --> 00:02:50.186 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎My question is, Do you salute the flag?”

00:02:50.186 --> 00:02:51.754 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And I said, “Let me explain it.”

00:02:51.754 --> 00:02:53.489 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He said: “I don’t want an explanation.

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.126 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I just want to know yes or no; 
do you or do you not?”

00:02:57.126 --> 00:02:59.295 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I said, “I do not.”

00:02:59.295 --> 00:03:01.297 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He threw me up in the air.

00:03:01.297 --> 00:03:03.600 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I fell on my back in the street there,

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.236 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and then about three of them 
got on top of me.

00:03:06.236 --> 00:03:08.238 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He said: “You’re going 
to salute the flag or eat it.

00:03:08.238 --> 00:03:10.573 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Bring me that flag over there.”

00:03:10.573 --> 00:03:13.543 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I was praying to Jehovah 
to remember me in the resurrection.

00:03:13.543 --> 00:03:18.348 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎About that time, several women 
ran out of the houses on both sides of us:

00:03:18.348 --> 00:03:21.050 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Leave those men alone. 
They didn’t bother you.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.286 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Leave them alone. 
Let them go.”

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:27.423 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So they got off of me, and they left us 
like a bunch of beaten kittens.

00:03:27.423 --> 00:03:32.295 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I was asked to go to Brooklyn Bethel 
and become a member of the Bethel home.

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:35.565 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Brother Knorr asked me, 
“Do you know how to use the typewriter?”

00:03:35.565 --> 00:03:37.834 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I said, “Yes, I can type.”

00:03:37.834 --> 00:03:40.503 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He said: “Well, I’m going 
to put you on a machine.

00:03:40.503 --> 00:03:42.138 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“It’s called a Linotype.

00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:44.140 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It has three keyboards.”

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.843 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And he said: “And it will take you 
about two years to learn it.

00:03:46.843 --> 00:03:48.311 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Are you willing to accept it?”

00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:50.413 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And I said, “Yes, I will.”

00:03:50.413 --> 00:03:52.415 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So I was put on the Linotype.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.921 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I got married 
in the fall of 1945 and left Bethel.

00:03:57.921 --> 00:04:01.324 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, we were invited in 1949

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:03.326 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to go into the circuit work.

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:05.328 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We were in the 21st class of Gilead.

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:07.363 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We enjoyed that course very much.

00:04:07.363 --> 00:04:09.799 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We received an assignment for Cuba,

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.869 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and I was assigned as branch overseer.

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:16.339 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And in ’63,

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:19.542 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the police car came

00:04:19.542 --> 00:04:21.711 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎up to the branch 
at about ten o’clock at night.

00:04:21.711 --> 00:04:23.379 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I was told to take my papers,

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:26.783 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and we went 
over to the police station, and so forth.

00:04:26.783 --> 00:04:30.586 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And sure enough, 
soon thereafter, here comes an official.

00:04:30.586 --> 00:04:32.588 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He said, “You have to leave Cuba

00:04:32.588 --> 00:04:36.326 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because you’re not in favor 
of the Cuban government.”

00:04:36.326 --> 00:04:41.064 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎A person asked 
a policeman standing close by, he said,

00:04:41.064 --> 00:04:44.634 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Who are these people 
that are being sent out of the country?”

00:04:44.634 --> 00:04:46.235 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And they said: “Over there,”

00:04:47.036 --> 00:04:48.571 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎talking about me,

00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:50.573 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“see that gangster man over there?

00:04:50.573 --> 00:04:52.909 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He’s the head of it.”

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:55.478 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So then we got on the plane 
and headed back.

00:04:55.478 --> 00:04:58.181 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I got in contact with Brooklyn Bethel,

00:04:58.181 --> 00:05:00.183 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎talked to Brother Knorr, and he said,

00:05:00.183 --> 00:05:03.386 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“As soon as you can, 
in the next day or two, come back to Bethel.”

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:06.189 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And Brother Knorr said, 
“You got back just in time

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:08.358 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“to get back on the Linotype machine

00:05:08.358 --> 00:05:11.995 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to set up a new book we have in Spanish.”

00:05:11.995 --> 00:05:13.863 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So I did that and got on the Linotype.

00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:18.768 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And then Brother Knorr told me, he said,

00:05:18.768 --> 00:05:21.871 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“In 1964, we’re going to have 
a ten-month course in Gilead

00:05:21.871 --> 00:05:26.042 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎for all branch people 
who have branch experience.”

00:05:26.042 --> 00:05:28.244 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Oh, it was very, very good.

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:30.780 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We studied a lot, not only the Bible

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.750 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎(we studied a lot on the Bible, 
discourse and everything)

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.454 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but we studied a lot of branch material too.

00:05:38.454 --> 00:05:42.792 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Above everything else, 
our love for Jehovah should continue to grow.

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:46.129 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He knows our thoughts, our mind, our heart.

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:48.698 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He goes far beyond what man can do.

00:05:48.698 --> 00:05:50.366 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And whatever his decision is,

00:05:50.366 --> 00:05:54.537 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I’ve learned to understand 
that it’s the best decision.

00:05:54.537 --> 00:05:59.075 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I have learned that if we obey 
what the organization says

00:05:59.075 --> 00:06:02.111 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and what the Bible says, 
then we’re doing Jehovah’s will;

00:06:02.111 --> 00:06:03.813 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and that’s my concern

00:06:03.813 --> 00:06:08.785 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—no regrets whatsoever, none.

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:10.987 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Maybe I could’ve done more at times,

00:06:10.987 --> 00:06:13.623 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but I’m certainly glad 
that I have taken advantage of it

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:15.625 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as much as I have up until now.

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.727 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And it’s been a happy life.

00:06:17.727 --> 00:06:20.096 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And I have seen Jehovah’s hand

00:06:20.096 --> 00:06:23.699 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎time and again.

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:29.639 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Brother Goff has led 
a full, happy life in theocratic service. 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.674 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But do you wonder,

00:06:31.674 --> 00:06:34.410 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘How was he 
able to persevere for so many years

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.413 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and through so many different assignments?’ 

00:06:37.413 --> 00:06:39.515 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Cecil learned the value

00:06:39.515 --> 00:06:41.851 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of letting Jehovah and his organization

00:06:41.851 --> 00:06:44.187 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎shape his thinking. 

00:06:44.187 --> 00:06:46.989 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But he had to make 
a choice as a young man,

00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:50.059 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a choice all of Jehovah’s servants 
have to make. 

00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:54.030 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And that’s the basis 
for our discussion this month. 

00:06:54.063 --> 00:06:56.099 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The theme is

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:59.135 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Stop Being Molded 
by This System of Things.” 

00:06:59.869 --> 00:07:01.871 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In describing godly wisdom,

00:07:01.871 --> 00:07:03.606 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the ancient man Job

00:07:03.606 --> 00:07:06.209 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎recognized it as priceless. 

00:07:06.209 --> 00:07:08.611 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎At Job 28:17, he said:

00:07:08.611 --> 00:07:12.915 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Gold and glass cannot be compared to it.” 

00:07:12.915 --> 00:07:17.019 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Glass
—it has been around for centuries,

00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:19.522 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎even back in Job’s day. 

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:22.425 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎However, 
what revolutionized glass production

00:07:22.425 --> 00:07:25.561 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was the invention of glassblowing. 

00:07:25.561 --> 00:07:27.763 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎By blowing through a hollow tube,

00:07:27.763 --> 00:07:32.101 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a glassblower can quickly mold 
superheated molten glass

00:07:32.101 --> 00:07:34.137 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎into a specific shape.

00:07:35.238 --> 00:07:38.608 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Satan’s system has developed the art

00:07:38.608 --> 00:07:41.043 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of shaping the minds of people

00:07:41.043 --> 00:07:45.982 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎into fragile glass vessels 
with little useful purpose. 

00:07:45.982 --> 00:07:49.886 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In fact, 
Romans 9:22 refers to such ones

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:54.223 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as “vessels of wrath made fit for destruction.” 

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:59.228 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Find with me Romans 12:2. 

00:07:59.228 --> 00:08:03.166 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What is responsible for molding and shaping

00:08:03.166 --> 00:08:06.302 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the inclinations of the people of the world? 

00:08:06.302 --> 00:08:08.471 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Romans 12:2:

00:08:08.471 --> 00:08:12.074 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“And stop being molded 
by this system of things,

00:08:12.074 --> 00:08:16.345 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“but be transformed 
by making your mind over,

00:08:16.345 --> 00:08:18.581 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“so that you 
may prove to yourselves

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:22.985 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the good and acceptable 
and perfect will of God.” 

00:08:23.286 --> 00:08:26.556 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎To counteract “being molded,” 
the verse said:

00:08:26.556 --> 00:08:30.092 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“But be transformed 
by making your mind over.” 

00:08:30.092 --> 00:08:34.297 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So the molding of this system 
is related to our thinking

00:08:34.297 --> 00:08:36.465 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—the shaping of our minds.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:42.705 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, what evil air 
is blown down the hollow tube? 

00:08:42.705 --> 00:08:47.710 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s identified quite clearly for us 
at Ephesians 2:2, 3. 

00:08:49.545 --> 00:08:53.149 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Concerning a Christian’s previous 
unclean thinking and behavior, 

00:08:53.149 --> 00:08:54.617 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎verse 2 says:

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:57.353 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“In which you at one time walked

00:08:57.353 --> 00:09:00.756 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“according to the system 
of things of this world,

00:09:00.756 --> 00:09:05.027 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“according to the ruler 
of the authority of the air,

00:09:05.027 --> 00:09:09.632 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the spirit that is now at work 
in the sons of disobedience.” 

00:09:10.466 --> 00:09:15.304 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The verse makes clear 
that this “system of things” has a ruler. 

00:09:15.304 --> 00:09:19.976 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Satan is called 
“the ruler of the authority of the air.” 

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:24.480 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The verse indicates 
that “the air” is “the spirit” of the world. 

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.582 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, with such a mind-set,

00:09:26.582 --> 00:09:30.853 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎what kind of behavior 
does the thinking of the world lead to? 

00:09:30.853 --> 00:09:32.388 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Verse 3:

00:09:32.388 --> 00:09:36.892 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Yes, among them 
we all at one time conducted ourselves

00:09:36.892 --> 00:09:40.930 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“in harmony with the desires of our flesh,

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:45.268 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“carrying out the will 
of the flesh and of our thoughts,

00:09:45.268 --> 00:09:49.872 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and we were naturally children 
of wrath just as the rest.” 

00:09:49.872 --> 00:09:52.108 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For this reason, they become

00:09:52.108 --> 00:09:55.444 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“vessels of wrath made fit for destruction.”

00:09:56.479 --> 00:10:00.583 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Glassblowers often work 
in groups known as “shops.” 

00:10:00.583 --> 00:10:05.588 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎An apprentice dips 
a hollow blowpipe into the liquid glass. 

00:10:05.588 --> 00:10:09.892 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎By twirling it, 
he gathers a blob of molten glass. 

00:10:09.892 --> 00:10:12.561 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He shapes the blob by rolling it

00:10:12.561 --> 00:10:15.131 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎on a smooth surface called a marver. 

00:10:15.131 --> 00:10:18.768 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He then passes the tube 
to the gaffer, or shop master. 

00:10:19.568 --> 00:10:24.507 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He blows air into the tube 
and fashions the glass into a globe. 

00:10:24.507 --> 00:10:26.542 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎If a wine glass is being made,

00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:29.545 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the tube is then passed to the stem-maker

00:10:29.545 --> 00:10:32.315 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and another gather of glass is attached. 

00:10:32.315 --> 00:10:35.418 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It is then shaped 
by means of long-pointed tongs

00:10:35.418 --> 00:10:37.953 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to form the stem. 

00:10:37.953 --> 00:10:42.258 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Then, another gather of hot glass
is added to the stem. 

00:10:42.258 --> 00:10:45.761 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The craftsman rolls the tube 
on the arm of his chair. 

00:10:45.761 --> 00:10:49.498 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He forms the base of the glass.

00:10:49.498 --> 00:10:52.168 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We will briefly consider four ways

00:10:52.168 --> 00:10:55.004 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that this system subtly tries to shape

00:10:55.004 --> 00:10:57.673 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎our mind into Satan’s designs. 

00:10:58.674 --> 00:11:02.712 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The first is harmful peer pressure. 

00:11:02.712 --> 00:11:06.182 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, often this is just an apprentice
in Satan’s shop

00:11:06.182 --> 00:11:10.653 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—maybe fellow students in school,
fellow workers on the job. 

00:11:10.653 --> 00:11:13.622 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Don’t you think Satan will try to capitalize

00:11:13.622 --> 00:11:16.492 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎on these circumstantial relationships? 

00:11:16.492 --> 00:11:18.494 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Absolutely! 

00:11:18.494 --> 00:11:22.365 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Peer pressure
—it can have an influence on our mind.

00:11:23.666 --> 00:11:26.168 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They may make fun 
of our wholesome morals,

00:11:26.168 --> 00:11:29.305 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎our clean speech, our dignified dress. 

00:11:29.305 --> 00:11:31.340 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That is pressure. 

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:36.278 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Possibly, they invite us to do things
that we know will lead to no good. 

00:11:36.278 --> 00:11:38.314 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They are twirling us

00:11:38.314 --> 00:11:40.716 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎with their thinking, with their taunts,

00:11:40.716 --> 00:11:43.886 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or maybe with their flattery and temptation. 

00:11:43.886 --> 00:11:47.723 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They are rolling things 
over and over in our mind.

00:11:49.925 --> 00:11:53.429 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Turn to 2 Peter 2:18, 19. 

00:11:54.997 --> 00:11:56.999 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And as you read this,

00:11:56.999 --> 00:12:01.337 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎can you pick out a word 
that is equivalent to peer pressure?

00:12:01.337 --> 00:12:02.872 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Let’s read

00:12:02.872 --> 00:12:05.441 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎2 Peter 2:18, 19:

00:12:05.441 --> 00:12:10.446 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“They make high-sounding statements
that are empty [like air]. 

00:12:10.446 --> 00:12:14.583 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“By appealing to the desires of the flesh
and with acts of brazen conduct,

00:12:14.583 --> 00:12:19.388 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“they entice [that’s peer pressure] people

00:12:19.388 --> 00:12:22.825 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“who have just escaped 
from those who live in error.

00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:25.428 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“While they are promising them freedom,

00:12:25.428 --> 00:12:28.564 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“they themselves are slaves of corruption;

00:12:28.564 --> 00:12:31.634 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“for if anyone is overcome by someone,

00:12:31.634 --> 00:12:34.870 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎he is his slave.” 

00:12:35.137 --> 00:12:38.808 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The verse says that if we are overcome 
by peer pressure—enticed—

00:12:38.808 --> 00:12:41.477 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we actually become a “slave” of that person. 

00:12:41.477 --> 00:12:43.279 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That is scary!

00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:45.381 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s dangerous! 

00:12:45.381 --> 00:12:49.118 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Peer pressure is deceptively strong.

00:12:49.118 --> 00:12:51.954 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, what is another way
that the spirit of this system

00:12:51.954 --> 00:12:53.989 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎can shape our thinking? 

00:12:53.989 --> 00:12:57.126 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You recall that the apprentice 
passed the glassblowing tube

00:12:57.126 --> 00:13:01.630 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to the gaffer who blew air 
into the glass, giving it shape. 

00:13:02.932 --> 00:13:07.269 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What does Satan and this system 
next use to mold our thinking? 

00:13:08.471 --> 00:13:11.440 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Enticing advertisements. 

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.909 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Like the air of a glassblower,

00:13:13.909 --> 00:13:17.980 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎advertisements often have little substance. 

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.083 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For example, 
that product we decided to buy

00:13:21.083 --> 00:13:23.385 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when we last went shopping. 

00:13:23.385 --> 00:13:25.387 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Maybe it was a brand of clothing

00:13:25.387 --> 00:13:28.624 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or a brand of dry cereal 
we bought for breakfast. 

00:13:28.624 --> 00:13:33.329 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Is that always purely a personal,
rational decision on our part?

00:13:33.329 --> 00:13:36.098 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Or did advertising

00:13:36.098 --> 00:13:40.102 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎subtly but powerfully affect our choice? 

00:13:41.103 --> 00:13:44.373 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, it’s not that all advertising
is bad or misleading. 

00:13:45.174 --> 00:13:48.944 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But the more 
we allow ourselves to be influenced by it,

00:13:48.944 --> 00:13:53.282 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the more we are in danger 
of being led into a materialistic way of life. 

00:13:54.316 --> 00:13:57.653 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For example, 
instead of dry cereal,

00:13:57.653 --> 00:14:02.658 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎are we now influenced 
to buy that flashy-looking sports car?

00:14:02.658 --> 00:14:05.661 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Turn to 1 John 2:15-17. 

00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:12.835 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This system inflates our thinking
by means of “things.”

00:14:12.835 --> 00:14:15.237 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎First John 2:15, 16:

00:14:15.237 --> 00:14:19.308 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Do not love either the world
or the things in the world. 

00:14:19.308 --> 00:14:23.746 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“If anyone loves the world, 
the love of the Father is not in him;

00:14:23.746 --> 00:14:26.549 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“because everything in the world

00:14:26.549 --> 00:14:30.553 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“—the desire of the flesh 
and the desire of the eyes

00:14:30.553 --> 00:14:33.355 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and the showy display 
of one’s means of life—

00:14:33.355 --> 00:14:35.558 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“does not originate with the Father,

00:14:35.558 --> 00:14:38.627 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but originates with the world.” 

00:14:38.894 --> 00:14:41.230 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Why do we need to resist catering

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.733 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to advertisements 
that feed the spirit of the world? 

00:14:44.733 --> 00:14:46.502 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Verse 17:

00:14:46.835 --> 00:14:50.205 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Furthermore, the world is passing away

00:14:50.205 --> 00:14:53.609 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and so is its desire,

00:14:53.609 --> 00:14:58.447 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but the one who does 
the will of God remains forever.” 

00:14:58.647 --> 00:15:00.649 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Remember Eve! 

00:15:00.649 --> 00:15:04.086 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Satan advertised the forbidden fruit. 

00:15:04.086 --> 00:15:07.656 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The scripture says 
it was “desirable to the eyes,

00:15:07.656 --> 00:15:10.426 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎. . . the tree was pleasing to look at.” 

00:15:10.426 --> 00:15:13.228 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎She succumbed to the advertisement

00:15:13.228 --> 00:15:15.230 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎with disastrous results. 

00:15:16.799 --> 00:15:21.303 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Similarly, Satan used advertisements 
to try to reshape Jesus’ focus. 

00:15:21.303 --> 00:15:23.906 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Matthew chapter 4 says that Satan

00:15:23.906 --> 00:15:27.710 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“showed him all the kingdoms of the world,”

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:31.347 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎offering them 
in exchange for one act of worship. 

00:15:33.082 --> 00:15:36.585 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jesus simply turned him off. 

00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:42.524 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Don’t be overly influenced by advertisements.

00:15:43.926 --> 00:15:47.930 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What’s the next aspect of this system
that can distort our minds? 

00:15:48.964 --> 00:15:51.533 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Bad associations. 

00:15:51.533 --> 00:15:54.837 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It is as if the gaffer 
has now passed the glassblowing tube

00:15:54.837 --> 00:15:56.872 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎ to the stem-maker.

00:15:56.872 --> 00:15:59.408 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He takes another gather of molten glass

00:15:59.408 --> 00:16:02.611 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and attaches it to our globe. 

00:16:02.611 --> 00:16:05.347 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Then he stretches that associated blob

00:16:05.347 --> 00:16:07.516 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎into the form of a stem. 

00:16:08.417 --> 00:16:11.253 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, we already talked about peer pressure,

00:16:11.253 --> 00:16:14.356 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but that often comes 
from those who are not necessarily

00:16:14.356 --> 00:16:16.525 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎our close associates. 

00:16:16.525 --> 00:16:20.129 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What we’re discussing now is our decisions

00:16:20.129 --> 00:16:23.766 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎about whom we spend a lot of time with. 

00:16:23.766 --> 00:16:28.437 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎People who don’t love Jehovah 
can stretch and misshape our minds,

00:16:28.437 --> 00:16:32.608 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎providing a stem or a handle 
for the world to hold us by. 

00:16:34.043 --> 00:16:36.879 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Turn to 1 Corinthians 15:33. 

00:16:38.781 --> 00:16:43.652 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Sometimes we hear the phrase 
that some of the kids in school

00:16:43.652 --> 00:16:47.156 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎are nicer than some of the kids 
in the congregation. 

00:16:47.156 --> 00:16:51.493 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But usually, nicer actually means more fun

00:16:51.493 --> 00:16:53.495 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎rather than more wholesome. 

00:16:54.563 --> 00:16:59.268 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But let’s look 
at 1 Corinthians 15:33 in its context. 

00:16:59.268 --> 00:17:01.670 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What did the apostle Paul mean

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:06.175 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when he said to the Corinthians 
“bad associations”? 

00:17:06.175 --> 00:17:08.677 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎First Corinthians 15:33:

00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:11.647 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Do not be misled.

00:17:11.647 --> 00:17:15.784 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Bad associations spoil useful habits.” 

00:17:16.151 --> 00:17:19.621 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But what made these ones bad association? 

00:17:19.621 --> 00:17:21.924 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Let’s see it in context. 

00:17:21.924 --> 00:17:24.760 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Look at 1 Corinthians 15:12:

00:17:25.127 --> 00:17:29.832 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Now if it is being preached 
that Christ has been raised from the dead,

00:17:29.832 --> 00:17:34.636 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎how is it that some among you say 
there is no resurrection of the dead?”

00:17:35.404 --> 00:17:39.074 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, what was the initial problem 
with these associates? 

00:17:39.074 --> 00:17:42.311 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They did not believe the same way. 

00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:45.748 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Why would that make them bad associations? 

00:17:45.748 --> 00:17:48.617 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Because what an associate believes

00:17:48.617 --> 00:17:51.520 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎will eventually affect our thinking,

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.124 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and our thinking affects our behavior. 

00:17:55.124 --> 00:17:57.793 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Notice how Paul describes this. 

00:17:57.793 --> 00:18:01.263 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Look at 1 Corinthians 15:32. 

00:18:01.263 --> 00:18:06.268 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What good is it to endure 
the rigors of the Christian race for life

00:18:06.268 --> 00:18:09.438 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎if there is no resurrection,
no future, no hope? 

00:18:09.438 --> 00:18:11.273 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Verse 32:

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.477 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“If like other men, 
I have fought with wild beasts at Ephesus,

00:18:15.477 --> 00:18:17.579 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“of what good is it to me? 

00:18:17.579 --> 00:18:19.848 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“If the dead are not to be raised up,

00:18:19.848 --> 00:18:24.486 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘let us eat and drink, 
for tomorrow we are to die.’”

00:18:24.887 --> 00:18:27.990 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎May all of us avoid bad association

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:32.327 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎whether in person, 
on TV, or on the Internet.

00:18:33.562 --> 00:18:35.564 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What’s a fourth means by which Satan

00:18:35.564 --> 00:18:39.902 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎attempts to fashion us, 
reshaping our thinking?

00:18:39.902 --> 00:18:42.671 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Higher education. 

00:18:42.671 --> 00:18:47.676 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Most of us remember 
the January 2015 JW Broadcasting program

00:18:47.676 --> 00:18:51.213 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎hosted by Brother Morris
of the Governing Body. 

00:18:51.213 --> 00:18:55.484 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He focused on the value of divine education. 

00:18:55.484 --> 00:18:57.486 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But he also reaffirmed

00:18:57.486 --> 00:19:01.924 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the dangers 
of pursuing higher secular education. 

00:19:01.924 --> 00:19:06.728 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Its whole purpose is for learning
—influencing one’s thinking. 

00:19:06.728 --> 00:19:09.898 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And while a person’s intention
might be just to create

00:19:09.898 --> 00:19:13.435 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a stable base for his secular future,

00:19:13.435 --> 00:19:15.571 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎his decision could expose him

00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:18.907 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to unscriptural ideas and practices.

00:19:20.175 --> 00:19:22.177 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Back to the glass shop. 

00:19:22.177 --> 00:19:25.113 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Recall that another gather of hot glass

00:19:25.113 --> 00:19:27.783 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is added to the end of the stem. 

00:19:27.783 --> 00:19:31.253 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The craftsman then rolls the tube 
backward and forward. 

00:19:31.253 --> 00:19:35.624 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He forms the base for the glass. 

00:19:35.624 --> 00:19:38.093 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, we will say no more about this topic

00:19:38.093 --> 00:19:41.830 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎other than what Brother Morris 
has already shared. 

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:45.634 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You might want to go back 
and review that broadcast. 

00:19:45.634 --> 00:19:50.138 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎However, 
we would like to read 1 Timothy 6:20, 21:

00:19:50.505 --> 00:19:55.344 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Timothy, guard what 
has been entrusted to you

00:19:55.344 --> 00:19:57.613 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“[that’s divine education],

00:19:57.613 --> 00:20:01.884 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“turning away from the empty speeches 
that violate what is holy

00:20:01.884 --> 00:20:03.919 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and from the contradictions

00:20:03.919 --> 00:20:06.989 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“of the falsely called ‘knowledge.’ 

00:20:06.989 --> 00:20:09.491 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“By making a show of such knowledge,

00:20:09.491 --> 00:20:13.362 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎some have deviated from the faith.” 

00:20:13.629 --> 00:20:16.598 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Unfortunately, in an effort to make

00:20:16.598 --> 00:20:19.401 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a stable base for one’s financial future,

00:20:19.401 --> 00:20:22.571 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎many “have deviated from the faith.”

00:20:24.439 --> 00:20:26.575 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In the visuals of a glassblowing shop,

00:20:26.575 --> 00:20:30.012 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we observed the skill of the workers involved. 

00:20:30.012 --> 00:20:32.547 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And that shop obviously produces

00:20:32.547 --> 00:20:35.217 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎beautiful, useful glass vessels. 

00:20:36.551 --> 00:20:41.056 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Satan’s glass shop 
is also skilled at shaping one’s thinking. 

00:20:41.823 --> 00:20:44.393 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But what does it produce? 

00:20:44.393 --> 00:20:48.730 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Instead of a person becoming 
a valuable vessel that Jehovah can use,

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:52.834 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Satan is actually mass-producing

00:20:52.834 --> 00:20:56.305 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎worthless vessels that Jehovah cannot use. 

00:20:56.305 --> 00:21:00.042 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What could you do 
with this misshaped creation? 

00:21:00.042 --> 00:21:02.544 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Nothing
—it is useless. 

00:21:03.845 --> 00:21:07.182 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎At the outset, 
Romans 9:22 was quoted. 

00:21:07.182 --> 00:21:10.886 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Those who conform 
to Satan’s system are referred to

00:21:10.886 --> 00:21:15.057 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as “vessels of wrath 
made fit for destruction.”

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.430 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah has paid a high price for us. 

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:24.766 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Gold and glass cannot be compared to it. 

00:21:24.766 --> 00:21:28.704 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎May we make over our minds 
by applying godly wisdom. 

00:21:28.704 --> 00:21:32.741 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Glorify Jehovah 
as a vessel that he can use. 

00:21:32.741 --> 00:21:37.112 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎First Corinthians 6:20 
concludes this discussion nicely, saying:

00:21:37.112 --> 00:21:40.115 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“For you were bought with a price.

00:21:40.115 --> 00:21:44.519 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎By all means, glorify God in your body.”

00:21:45.087 --> 00:21:48.457 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How else may the world try to mold us? 

00:21:48.457 --> 00:21:52.327 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Another way 
is through the entertainment it produces. 

00:21:52.327 --> 00:21:56.131 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How can we choose 
entertainment that will enhance

00:21:56.131 --> 00:21:59.901 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and not taint our sacrifice to Jehovah? 

00:21:59.901 --> 00:22:02.004 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In the following dramatization,

00:22:02.004 --> 00:22:04.006 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎notice how a fellow Christian

00:22:04.006 --> 00:22:07.843 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎helps a young brother to make better choices.

00:22:32.467 --> 00:22:35.871 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I promised Akil I’d go out 
in service with him after school.

00:22:35.871 --> 00:22:38.006 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Hey, we’re just waiting in the car.

00:22:41.009 --> 00:22:45.514 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And I kept my word, 

00:22:49.184 --> 00:22:53.021 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but my head just wasn’t in it. 

00:22:57.325 --> 00:23:01.897 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Akil could tell, so he tried 
to see if everything was OK. 

00:23:04.366 --> 00:23:06.768 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Honestly, at the time, 

00:23:06.768 --> 00:23:09.538 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I would have rather been playing 
video games, 

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:15.377 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but I couldn’t tell him that. 

00:23:15.377 --> 00:23:20.382 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I mean, 
he’s a pioneer, a ministerial servant. 

00:23:20.382 --> 00:23:23.318 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He wouldn’t understand.

00:23:43.271 --> 00:23:45.273 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Later that week, 

00:23:45.273 --> 00:23:49.945 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Akil invited me 
to go mountain biking with some friends. 

00:23:49.945 --> 00:23:52.914 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It was actually really fun.

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:56.651 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎. . . and your croissant.

00:23:56.651 --> 00:23:57.319 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Great, thanks.

00:23:57.319 --> 00:23:59.121 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Please let me know 
if there’s anything else, OK?

00:23:59.121 --> 00:24:01.123 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎All right. Thanks.

00:24:01.123 --> 00:24:03.125 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So, Danny, 
you’re obviously good at biking. 

00:24:03.125 --> 00:24:05.127 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What else do you like to do for fun?

00:24:05.127 --> 00:24:07.129 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎OK, so I have this game and it’s called . . .

00:24:07.129 --> 00:24:11.133 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Soon I was showing him my video games. 

00:24:15.437 --> 00:24:19.908 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And surprisingly, 
he liked video games too. 

00:24:20.976 --> 00:24:24.980 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But he said he chose to be selective. 

00:24:26.414 --> 00:24:31.253 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He began to describe 
the gladiators in ancient Rome. 

00:24:37.025 --> 00:24:39.661 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎People would come from all over 

00:24:39.661 --> 00:24:42.864 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to watch them fight to the death. 

00:24:42.864 --> 00:24:46.168 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And while the spectators 
weren’t in any physical danger, 

00:24:47.402 --> 00:24:50.438 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the real danger came over time. 

00:24:58.713 --> 00:25:01.950 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Repeatedly watching 
the bloodshed and the killing, 

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:06.054 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎it was dulling their senses, 
and they wanted more of it. 

00:25:09.391 --> 00:25:14.462 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This was a big test 
for the Christians who lived back then. 

00:25:19.501 --> 00:25:22.037 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Akil helped me to reason on the scripture

00:25:22.037 --> 00:25:24.539 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎at Romans 12:9: 

00:25:26.308 --> 00:25:31.246 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Abhor what is wicked; 
cling to what is good.”

00:25:31.246 --> 00:25:33.048 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So, Danny,

00:25:33.048 --> 00:25:35.350 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the games may have changed over time, 

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:38.186 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but the violence is still the same. 

00:25:38.186 --> 00:25:40.188 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I like video games, 

00:25:40.889 --> 00:25:43.558 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but I avoid the ones 
that promote what Jehovah hates.

00:25:47.829 --> 00:25:51.066 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah’s people can still have fun. 

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:06.748 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And, yeah, 
we can even play video games. 

00:26:06.748 --> 00:26:11.186 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I just want to make wise choices. 

00:26:13.855 --> 00:26:16.958 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I want to show Jehovah 
that I hate wickedness 

00:26:23.064 --> 00:26:26.468 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and make his heart glad.

00:26:35.744 --> 00:26:39.681 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This video is part of a series of videos. 

00:26:39.681 --> 00:26:41.716 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We’re pleased to announce

00:26:41.716 --> 00:26:44.786 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that all 17 episodes
will be made available

00:26:44.786 --> 00:26:49.157 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎under a new 
“Principles for Daily Living” category. 

00:26:49.157 --> 00:26:54.162 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It can be found in both the “Family” 
and “Our Meetings and Ministry” sections. 

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:57.399 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As we saw in this episode,

00:26:57.399 --> 00:27:00.869 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎our choice of entertainment 
can affect our worship. 

00:27:00.869 --> 00:27:05.040 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We could be exposing 
ourselves to Satan’s thinking. 

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:09.444 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎If you’re enticed 
by entertainment that displeases Jehovah,

00:27:09.444 --> 00:27:12.514 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎what Bible principles will help you? 

00:27:12.514 --> 00:27:15.283 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Chapter 6 of the “God’s Love” book

00:27:15.283 --> 00:27:17.352 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎features a box entitled

00:27:17.352 --> 00:27:20.355 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“What Entertainment Should I Choose?” 

00:27:20.355 --> 00:27:22.657 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Make the scriptures in this feature

00:27:22.657 --> 00:27:26.661 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a matter of prayer 
and discussion in family worship. 

00:27:26.661 --> 00:27:30.298 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They will help you “cling to what is good.” 

00:27:30.999 --> 00:27:33.735 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But at times ‘clinging to the good’

00:27:33.735 --> 00:27:36.237 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎includes receiving discipline,

00:27:36.237 --> 00:27:38.807 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎which can be painful. 

00:27:38.807 --> 00:27:41.543 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How can we look beyond any pain

00:27:41.543 --> 00:27:45.480 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to the benefits of divine correction? 

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.482 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎At a Bethel morning worship,

00:27:47.482 --> 00:27:50.685 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Brother Anthony Morris, 
a member of the Governing Body,

00:27:50.685 --> 00:27:54.122 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎discussed how a proper view of discipline

00:27:54.122 --> 00:27:56.791 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎brings us closer to Jehovah.

00:27:57.659 --> 00:27:58.727 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This morning

00:27:58.727 --> 00:28:00.462 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I thought I’d discuss the matter 

00:28:00.462 --> 00:28:03.098 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of how a proper view of discipline 

00:28:03.098 --> 00:28:05.667 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎keeps us close to Jehovah. 

00:28:05.667 --> 00:28:08.036 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, in the context of today’s text 

00:28:08.036 --> 00:28:09.304 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎about Jehovah correcting 

00:28:09.304 --> 00:28:11.406 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to the proper degree, 

00:28:11.406 --> 00:28:15.710 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎he’s talking to his people
about being brought back to their land. 

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:19.981 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He was not going to exterminate them 
or leave them, 

00:28:19.981 --> 00:28:23.385 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and it helps us to appreciate 
that he wanted them 

00:28:23.385 --> 00:28:26.121 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to keep their relationship with him. 

00:28:26.121 --> 00:28:30.925 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, today we receive 
discipline in various ways. 

00:28:30.925 --> 00:28:34.129 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It might be from personal Bible study. 

00:28:34.129 --> 00:28:36.131 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And I was excited this morning 

00:28:36.131 --> 00:28:39.100 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎(I don’t know when it happened, 
maybe last night) 

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.536 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to see that we have in JW Library® 

00:28:41.536 --> 00:28:43.538 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where we can put our personal notes, 

00:28:43.538 --> 00:28:46.174 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and I got started with some already. 

00:28:46.174 --> 00:28:49.811 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So that’ll be like thoughts 
or discipline from Jehovah 

00:28:49.811 --> 00:28:53.214 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that is just between him and ourselves 

00:28:53.214 --> 00:28:57.318 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—a very beneficial and wise way 
to go when it comes to discipline. 

00:28:57.318 --> 00:29:01.122 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It keeps us from veering off 
in our relationship with him. 

00:29:01.122 --> 00:29:03.925 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It might be something 
we read in a publication; 

00:29:03.925 --> 00:29:07.095 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎might hear in a talk at a meeting, 
at an assembly, 

00:29:07.095 --> 00:29:10.932 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or convention; 
something in a JW Broadcast 

00:29:10.932 --> 00:29:15.937 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—various ways, any number of ways 
Jehovah will discipline us. 

00:29:15.937 --> 00:29:18.506 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And we need to remember 

00:29:18.506 --> 00:29:21.776 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that he does it 
so that we remain close to him. 

00:29:21.776 --> 00:29:26.114 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The problem is discipline 
is not easy to take. 

00:29:26.114 --> 00:29:28.116 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It requires humility. 

00:29:28.116 --> 00:29:32.620 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And the proper view of discipline 
is found here in Proverbs chapter 3, 

00:29:34.355 --> 00:29:38.126 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and this gives us the Scriptural basis 

00:29:38.126 --> 00:29:40.361 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to have this proper view of discipline 

00:29:40.361 --> 00:29:43.832 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that’ll keep us close to Jehovah God. 

00:29:43.832 --> 00:29:48.670 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, notice verses 11 and 12 
of Proverbs chapter 3: 

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:52.841 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“My son, do not reject 
the discipline of Jehovah, 

00:29:52.841 --> 00:29:55.443 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and do not loathe his reproof, 

00:29:55.443 --> 00:29:59.047 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“for those whom Jehovah loves 
he reproves, 

00:29:59.047 --> 00:30:03.418 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎just as a father does a son 
in whom he delights.” 

00:30:03.418 --> 00:30:07.822 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So how might we reject 
the discipline of Jehovah? 

00:30:07.822 --> 00:30:11.726 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, put yourself 
in a position of being counseled. 

00:30:11.726 --> 00:30:15.296 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s come to the point 
where overseers and elders 

00:30:15.296 --> 00:30:17.866 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎have had to sit down with you. 

00:30:17.866 --> 00:30:21.503 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, for some, 
as soon as the counsel begins to flow, 

00:30:21.503 --> 00:30:25.039 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎there’s this quickness to be upset, 

00:30:25.039 --> 00:30:28.710 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to justify, to feel picked on. 

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:32.280 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, Jehovah is saying, ‘Don’t reject this.’ 

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:36.451 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎If they’re using the Scriptures 
and thoughts from publications, 

00:30:36.451 --> 00:30:41.456 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎view it as coming from Jehovah 
so that we can stay close to him. 

00:30:41.456 --> 00:30:44.325 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, to give you an idea, 

00:30:44.325 --> 00:30:48.997 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎sometimes reading something 
will bring us close to Jehovah, 

00:30:48.997 --> 00:30:52.567 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎especially if we veered off 
and didn’t even realize it. 

00:30:52.567 --> 00:30:55.803 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I’m going to go way back 
to some examples 

00:30:55.803 --> 00:31:00.275 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of Jehovah’s sheep 
reading something in The Watchtower, 

00:31:00.275 --> 00:31:04.646 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and it just disciplined them 
so that they could get close to Jehovah. 

00:31:04.646 --> 00:31:07.549 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And it goes way back to 1982, 

00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:11.586 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and it had to do with TV serials, 
or soap operas. 

00:31:11.586 --> 00:31:14.822 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Some are saying, 
“Well, that’s a long time ago.” 

00:31:14.822 --> 00:31:17.659 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, the fact is nothing has changed. 

00:31:17.659 --> 00:31:21.629 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Some of these soap operas 
are still on that had the name 

00:31:21.629 --> 00:31:23.631 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that they had in 1982. 

00:31:23.631 --> 00:31:25.133 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They still have it. 

00:31:25.133 --> 00:31:29.270 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So many readers 
personally benefited from the counsel. 

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:31.940 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The counsel still applies 
that was found there. 

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:34.742 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But I think it’s very touching 
and commendable 

00:31:34.742 --> 00:31:39.547 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎for the ones who read that 
that they recognized it. 

00:31:39.547 --> 00:31:41.549 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It impacted their relationship with Jehovah, 

00:31:41.549 --> 00:31:43.551 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and they wanted to get close to him. 

00:31:43.551 --> 00:31:46.654 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, the cover on The Watchtower was 

00:31:46.654 --> 00:31:49.591 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“TV Serials—Can They Corrupt the Heart?” 

00:31:49.591 --> 00:31:52.894 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And in the opening article, we did say: 

00:31:52.894 --> 00:31:56.664 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Millions of women and men of all ages, 

00:31:56.664 --> 00:32:00.001 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎races and backgrounds 
will rarely miss a show.” 

00:32:00.001 --> 00:32:04.739 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, now you can record them 
and have them anytime that you like. 

00:32:04.739 --> 00:32:09.310 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s still an ongoing problem 
and an issue for a true Christian, 

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:13.781 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a worshipper of Jehovah, 
to make sure we’re not being corrupted 

00:32:13.781 --> 00:32:16.884 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎by soap operas, or TV serials.

00:32:16.884 --> 00:32:19.887 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, after the articles came out, 

00:32:19.887 --> 00:32:24.392 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we had some write in 
to explain what happened to them. 

00:32:24.392 --> 00:32:29.397 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And so months later, 
after this 1982 issue of The Watchtower 

00:32:29.397 --> 00:32:32.000 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎(that was December 1), 

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.470 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we went 
to the ’83 Watchtower, December 1, 

00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:37.839 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and here’s the response 
from some of the readers. 

00:32:37.839 --> 00:32:40.208 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And I found it very commendable. 

00:32:40.208 --> 00:32:44.445 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I think you’ll appreciate the humility 
because it takes humility 

00:32:44.445 --> 00:32:47.215 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to accept and have 
the proper view of discipline. 

00:32:47.215 --> 00:32:49.884 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So one of the dangers 

00:32:49.884 --> 00:32:52.954 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that the brothers 
were warned about is that 

00:32:52.954 --> 00:32:57.291 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎you can get emotionally attached 
to the characters in the show. 

00:32:57.291 --> 00:32:59.761 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So here’s what one wrote: 

00:32:59.761 --> 00:33:02.530 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I had grown up 
watching this one soap opera 

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:06.668 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and the character ‘Julie’ 
was just like my ‘friend.’ . . . 

00:33:06.668 --> 00:33:09.237 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“One day ‘Julie’ had an accident 

00:33:09.237 --> 00:33:13.041 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“that left her beautiful face 
badly scarred . . . 

00:33:13.041 --> 00:33:15.943 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I was in front of the TV set every day 

00:33:15.943 --> 00:33:19.247 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“to make sure 
she was going to pull through. 

00:33:19.247 --> 00:33:22.984 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“That night as I was saying my prayers, 

00:33:22.984 --> 00:33:25.153 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“before I even thought 
what I was saying, 

00:33:25.153 --> 00:33:30.158 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I prayed, 
‘And Jehovah, please bless Julie.’” 

00:33:31.693 --> 00:33:34.595 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, she admits: 
“‘I was shocked. 

00:33:34.595 --> 00:33:37.532 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘[She should’ve been.] 

00:33:37.532 --> 00:33:42.537 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘This plea to Jehovah for Julie 
had come from my heart!’

00:33:42.537 --> 00:33:44.906 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Realizing how involved 
she had become, 

00:33:44.906 --> 00:33:47.508 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“she stopped watching these programs. 

00:33:47.508 --> 00:33:49.510 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“She wrote: ‘If all readers 

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:53.047 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘will take your article 
on TV serials to heart, 

00:33:53.047 --> 00:33:56.017 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘they will feel a real sense of freedom, 

00:33:56.017 --> 00:34:00.121 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎since our own everyday problems 
are enough to cope with.’” 

00:34:00.121 --> 00:34:03.825 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So, you see, our sister 
had the proper view of discipline, 

00:34:03.825 --> 00:34:08.329 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and she was able 
to keep close to Jehovah. 

00:34:08.329 --> 00:34:11.999 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, another one, 
after expressing appreciation, wrote: 

00:34:11.999 --> 00:34:15.603 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I realized that I was ‘addicted’ 
to soap operas, 

00:34:15.603 --> 00:34:17.605 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and that I had to do something about it. 

00:34:17.605 --> 00:34:22.009 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I wondered, too, if my relationship 
with Jehovah could be affected. 

00:34:22.009 --> 00:34:24.879 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“How could I have ‘them’ as friends 

00:34:24.879 --> 00:34:27.415 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and also be a friend to Jehovah? 

00:34:27.415 --> 00:34:29.450 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I had to quit all at once

00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:33.521 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—it was the only way, 
and how hard it was!” she admits. 

00:34:33.521 --> 00:34:35.757 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So, what did she 
have to do to break free? 

00:34:35.757 --> 00:34:37.759 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎She had to unplug her TV. 

00:34:37.759 --> 00:34:41.763 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎She’d go outdoors 
and work in the garden, call somebody

00:34:41.763 --> 00:34:45.066 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—anything to stay busy 
so that she wouldn’t go back 

00:34:45.066 --> 00:34:48.035 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to watching those soap operas. 

00:34:48.035 --> 00:34:50.371 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎She took time for personal Bible study 

00:34:50.371 --> 00:34:52.373 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—that’ll keep you close to Jehovah—

00:34:52.373 --> 00:34:55.943 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎preparing for her meetings, 
and other spiritual things. 

00:34:55.943 --> 00:34:59.781 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And then she confesses: 
“How much better I felt! 

00:34:59.781 --> 00:35:03.651 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“It has been over two years now 
[from this last writing] 

00:35:03.651 --> 00:35:06.687 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“since I have seen 
those so-called friends. 

00:35:06.687 --> 00:35:09.357 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I must admit 
that at times I still wonder 

00:35:09.357 --> 00:35:13.060 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“what is going on with them, 
but I fight it. . . . 

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:17.498 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Perhaps many others 
who have not yet broken free will now.” 

00:35:17.498 --> 00:35:21.836 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎She says: 
‘Thank you, Jehovah and you brothers, 

00:35:21.836 --> 00:35:25.439 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎for exposing 
this “good-for-nothing thing.”’

00:35:25.439 --> 00:35:28.342 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Then, finally, this third one says: 

00:35:28.342 --> 00:35:31.179 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I cried when I read the articles, 

00:35:31.179 --> 00:35:35.817 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“for I discovered that my heart 
was no longer complete toward Jehovah. 

00:35:35.817 --> 00:35:37.585 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I promised my God

00:35:37.585 --> 00:35:40.555 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“that I would no longer be 
a slave to these serials 

00:35:40.555 --> 00:35:43.524 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and asked him to help me 
to get out of my home 

00:35:43.524 --> 00:35:46.427 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“on the day of the program. . . . 

00:35:46.427 --> 00:35:49.397 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Two days later, 
I was invited to attend a Bible study 

00:35:49.397 --> 00:35:52.967 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“on the very day and time of ‘my’ serial. 

00:35:52.967 --> 00:35:54.969 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I happily accepted. . . . 

00:35:54.969 --> 00:35:58.840 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“[and notice] I now feel 
closer to Jehovah, 

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:02.009 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and my relationship with him 
is more intimate. 

00:36:02.009 --> 00:36:06.113 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How good Jehovah is 
to discipline us through his Word!” 

00:36:06.113 --> 00:36:10.251 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Yes, she had 
the proper view of discipline. 

00:36:10.251 --> 00:36:14.488 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, finally, 
let’s look in Hebrews chapter 12, 

00:36:16.257 --> 00:36:18.926 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and we appreciate 
these sincere comments 

00:36:18.926 --> 00:36:22.163 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and the counsel there certainly applies. 

00:36:22.163 --> 00:36:24.165 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Any kind of entertainment 

00:36:24.165 --> 00:36:27.635 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that has that corrupting influence 

00:36:27.635 --> 00:36:30.705 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎would be avoided by a true Christian. 

00:36:30.705 --> 00:36:33.741 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So here at Hebrews chapter 12, 

00:36:33.741 --> 00:36:36.310 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎notice verse 11: 

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:40.481 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“True, no discipline seems 
for the present to be joyous, 

00:36:40.481 --> 00:36:42.483 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“but it is painful; 

00:36:42.483 --> 00:36:46.420 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“yet afterward, it yields 
the peaceable fruit of righteousness 

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:48.556 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to those who have been trained by it.” 

00:36:48.556 --> 00:36:51.259 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So discipline is painful, 

00:36:51.259 --> 00:36:53.294 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but “the peaceable fruit 
of righteousness”

00:36:53.294 --> 00:36:57.965 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎makes it worth it 
to have a proper view of the discipline 

00:36:57.965 --> 00:37:00.401 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and to accept it humbly 

00:37:00.401 --> 00:37:04.906 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎so that we can remain close 
to our precious Father, Jehovah. 

00:37:06.274 --> 00:37:09.677 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Discipline helps us 
reshape our thinking and actions,

00:37:09.677 --> 00:37:13.347 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎drawing us closer to our Grand Creator. 

00:37:13.347 --> 00:37:15.716 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It may come from God’s Word,

00:37:15.716 --> 00:37:18.886 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎publications produced 
by “the faithful and discreet slave,”

00:37:18.886 --> 00:37:23.024 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a parent, or mature fellow Christians. 

00:37:23.024 --> 00:37:25.693 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎No matter how we receive discipline,

00:37:25.693 --> 00:37:29.497 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎always remember what Proverbs 3:12 says:

00:37:29.497 --> 00:37:32.733 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Those whom Jehovah loves he reproves,

00:37:32.733 --> 00:37:36.070 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎just as a father does a son 
in whom he delights.”

00:37:37.371 --> 00:37:40.641 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But what if the world’s thinking 
has molded you,

00:37:40.641 --> 00:37:44.445 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎not by choice, but by circumstance? 

00:37:44.445 --> 00:37:48.282 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You’ll appreciate the story 
of sister Guzel Gainanshina,

00:37:48.282 --> 00:37:51.385 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎who was not raised 
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. 

00:37:51.385 --> 00:37:54.488 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In her youth, 
Guzel searched for fulfillment

00:37:54.488 --> 00:37:56.857 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎through competitive sports.

00:37:56.857 --> 00:37:59.927 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Even though she achieved
some level of success, 

00:37:59.927 --> 00:38:04.231 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎what helped her 
to find a true purpose in life?

00:38:06.901 --> 00:38:10.271 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I lived in the north, 
with the glorious dark, starlit sky

00:38:10.271 --> 00:38:12.373 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and the beauty of fir trees. 

00:38:12.373 --> 00:38:14.842 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I thought it was 
the most wonderful place in the world.

00:38:14.842 --> 00:38:17.812 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎My mom was always drawing 
my attention to the beauty of creation.

00:38:18.713 --> 00:38:20.881 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And she always told me, 

00:38:20.881 --> 00:38:23.851 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“My daughter, it’s so important 
to live your life in the right way.”

00:38:23.851 --> 00:38:25.853 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And the questions 
that stayed with me were:

00:38:25.853 --> 00:38:28.222 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘So why are we alive? 

00:38:28.222 --> 00:38:32.093 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Why is there so much 
suffering, injustice, pain?’

00:38:32.093 --> 00:38:35.129 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When I was 18, 
I took up a form of karate

00:38:35.129 --> 00:38:37.331 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎known as Kyokushinkai. 

00:38:39.333 --> 00:38:42.670 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Just imagine a large number 
of people in kimonos, standing in rows

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:44.772 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎bravely and without a shadow of fear, 

00:38:44.772 --> 00:38:47.708 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎working on improving their blows
and striving to progress. 

00:38:47.708 --> 00:38:51.012 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I thought: ‘This is it! 
This is what I’ve been looking for!’

00:38:51.012 --> 00:38:53.547 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I set the goal of reaching 
the next world championships,

00:38:53.547 --> 00:38:55.549 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎winning a high place, 

00:38:55.549 --> 00:38:58.452 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and immortalizing myself 
so that my name would remain

00:38:58.452 --> 00:39:00.354 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and generations would remember me. 

00:39:05.059 --> 00:39:08.229 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Among those sportsmen, although I saw
a lot of nice words and slogans, 

00:39:08.229 --> 00:39:11.065 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎not everything was as pure as I’d hoped for. 

00:39:13.334 --> 00:39:16.003 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And then on one occasion,
I was sitting down 

00:39:17.071 --> 00:39:19.073 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and feelings of emptiness 

00:39:19.073 --> 00:39:21.842 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎just wouldn’t leave me alone. 

00:39:21.842 --> 00:39:24.145 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And for the first time in my life, 

00:39:24.145 --> 00:39:26.147 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I talked to God. 

00:39:26.147 --> 00:39:28.182 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And then I prayed: 

00:39:28.182 --> 00:39:30.885 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I don’t understand you. 

00:39:30.885 --> 00:39:34.488 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Why is there so much beauty in the world 

00:39:34.488 --> 00:39:37.024 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and yet so much suffering? 

00:39:38.025 --> 00:39:40.161 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Is that really what you want 

00:39:40.161 --> 00:39:41.829 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—for us to live like this?” 

00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:45.099 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I prayed, I guess, for about four hours. 

00:39:45.099 --> 00:39:48.202 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You know, the strongest feeling
of emptiness and loneliness 

00:39:49.103 --> 00:39:51.739 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is that of a creation 

00:39:51.739 --> 00:39:53.340 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎without its Creator. 

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:56.110 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And I was so lonely at that time. 

00:39:58.079 --> 00:40:02.049 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And a while afterwards, 
there was a knock at my door. 

00:40:02.049 --> 00:40:06.153 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It was Jehovah’s Witnesses. 

00:40:08.189 --> 00:40:09.723 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I started studying the Bible. 

00:40:09.723 --> 00:40:11.292 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It was so wonderful! 

00:40:13.294 --> 00:40:16.297 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎On one occasion, 
the sister who studied with me 

00:40:16.297 --> 00:40:18.332 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎looked up at me, 
and when she looked at those bruises 

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:21.402 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and those beaten-up knuckles, 

00:40:22.903 --> 00:40:25.906 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎she took a deep breath and shook her head. 

00:40:25.906 --> 00:40:27.541 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I said, “Is there something wrong?” 

00:40:28.609 --> 00:40:31.245 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎She said, “You know, I’m in great pain.” 

00:40:31.245 --> 00:40:34.115 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I said, “Why are you in pain?” 

00:40:34.115 --> 00:40:35.249 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎She said: “Well, 

00:40:35.249 --> 00:40:39.687 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I’m looking at your hands, 
your elbows, your battered legs, all of that. 

00:40:39.687 --> 00:40:42.890 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Doesn’t it hurt?” 

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:45.593 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I said, “Well, yes.” 

00:40:45.593 --> 00:40:50.331 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And she said, “You know, 
it hurts me to see you in pain.”

00:40:50.331 --> 00:40:53.934 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And I started to understand 
that Jehovah is the true God 

00:40:53.934 --> 00:40:56.270 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and that this really was the truth. 

00:40:57.171 --> 00:40:58.806 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It was difficult. 

00:40:58.806 --> 00:41:02.776 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The pressure from relatives
and friends was very strong.

00:41:02.776 --> 00:41:04.845 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But the most difficult thing 

00:41:04.845 --> 00:41:08.082 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that I had to battle with 
was my strong attachment to karate.

00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:11.852 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Just a year remained 
until the world championships.

00:41:11.852 --> 00:41:13.487 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I had prepared for them. 

00:41:13.487 --> 00:41:17.791 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I had been working 
toward that goal for five years.

00:41:17.791 --> 00:41:20.694 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Glory can seem really sweet 

00:41:20.694 --> 00:41:25.599 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when you are the victor, 
when your opponents fall to the ground.

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:31.572 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So I flew to the world championships. 

00:41:31.572 --> 00:41:34.074 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When I made it to the last four winners 

00:41:34.074 --> 00:41:37.044 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and I had to fight for third place, 

00:41:37.044 --> 00:41:39.280 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I wanted to ask my trainer 
to let me stop. Why? 

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:43.384 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Because I couldn’t feel 
a single place on my body 

00:41:43.384 --> 00:41:45.186 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—everything was beaten up. 

00:41:45.186 --> 00:41:46.554 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But he said: 

00:41:46.554 --> 00:41:50.457 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“You know, we love you so much. 
Go for it!”

00:41:50.457 --> 00:41:54.328 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And at that moment, 
it felt as though I was weighing love 

00:41:54.328 --> 00:41:55.796 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—the world’s love 

00:41:55.796 --> 00:41:58.299 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and the love of Jehovah’s organization. 

00:41:58.299 --> 00:42:00.701 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It seemed to me 
that the world was saying: 

00:42:00.701 --> 00:42:04.305 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“We love you. 
Now just go and die!”

00:42:04.305 --> 00:42:06.807 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But the love in the organization says, 

00:42:06.807 --> 00:42:09.009 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“It hurts me to see you in pain.” 

00:42:09.009 --> 00:42:13.380 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I realized that the world 
can’t give you what it doesn’t have. 

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:15.649 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It doesn’t know how to love. 

00:42:15.649 --> 00:42:17.651 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But, nevertheless, I went to the fight 

00:42:17.651 --> 00:42:20.454 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and became the bronze medalist. 

00:42:22.289 --> 00:42:25.826 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And when I stood on the podium of glory, 

00:42:25.826 --> 00:42:29.964 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I understood that glory 
among people who don’t love you 

00:42:29.964 --> 00:42:32.166 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎weighs no more than emptiness. 

00:42:33.234 --> 00:42:35.669 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎If a person dedicates his life 

00:42:35.669 --> 00:42:38.105 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to glorifying himself,
he will always meet 

00:42:38.105 --> 00:42:40.874 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎with disappointment and emptiness.

00:42:40.874 --> 00:42:44.278 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So I made the firm decision 
to escape from karate. 

00:42:45.212 --> 00:42:47.281 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I started preaching, 
and I was baptized in 2005 

00:42:47.281 --> 00:42:50.050 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎at the summer convention in Kurgan. 

00:42:52.653 --> 00:42:54.722 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Later, I started full-time service. 

00:42:54.722 --> 00:42:58.859 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I learned the Tatar language 
so that I could serve in that territory.

00:43:00.894 --> 00:43:02.896 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, when in the evenings 

00:43:02.896 --> 00:43:06.967 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I look up at the starry sky, 
I feel not hopelessness, 

00:43:06.967 --> 00:43:09.203 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but tremendous joy 

00:43:09.203 --> 00:43:12.406 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because I know who is behind it all: 

00:43:12.406 --> 00:43:17.411 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎our loving Creator, Jehovah God. 

00:43:22.082 --> 00:43:25.019 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Guzel had been “molded 
by this system of things,”

00:43:25.019 --> 00:43:29.023 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but she was “transformed 
by making [her] mind over.” 

00:43:29.023 --> 00:43:33.894 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The literal cuts and bruises 
Guzel suffered healed with time,

00:43:33.894 --> 00:43:38.899 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but she found true comfort 
from the One described at Psalm 147:3,

00:43:38.899 --> 00:43:41.335 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎who “heals the brokenhearted”

00:43:41.335 --> 00:43:43.937 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and who “binds up” the emotional “wounds”

00:43:43.937 --> 00:43:47.007 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎inflicted by this system of things. 

00:43:47.007 --> 00:43:50.711 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Her example shows that no matter
our situation or background,

00:43:50.711 --> 00:43:54.715 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the beautiful truths of God’s Word
can change us.

00:43:56.116 --> 00:43:58.519 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It may feel like a leap of faith

00:43:58.519 --> 00:44:03.524 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to leave behind secular pursuits
to reach spiritual goals. 

00:44:03.524 --> 00:44:06.960 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Some have made 
this leap after investing years

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:10.864 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of training, education, and financial resources

00:44:10.864 --> 00:44:14.101 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎toward a career in the world. 

00:44:14.101 --> 00:44:16.470 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎If that’s true for you,

00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:19.940 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎rest assured that you are not alone.

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:23.177 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Our next segment 
will introduce you to young ones

00:44:23.177 --> 00:44:25.946 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎who resisted the pressure to conform

00:44:25.946 --> 00:44:29.149 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to the world’s view of success.

00:44:31.852 --> 00:44:34.855 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Right now I am serving
in the Central America branch,

00:44:34.855 --> 00:44:38.192 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and I have the opportunity to work
with extraordinary brothers and sisters

00:44:38.192 --> 00:44:41.695 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—both here and in other parts of the world.

00:44:41.695 --> 00:44:43.030 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎My name is Rogelio. 

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:44.365 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I’m part of the Art Department, 

00:44:44.365 --> 00:44:45.999 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and I’m a digital illustrator.

00:44:48.202 --> 00:44:50.871 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Music really means the world to me.

00:44:50.871 --> 00:44:53.841 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I am Joyce; I’m a pioneer, 

00:44:53.841 --> 00:44:56.643 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and I sing alto in the Bethel chorus.

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:01.482 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎My name is Lou-Len, 

00:45:01.482 --> 00:45:04.718 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and I serve as a regular pioneer
in a congregation where there’s a need.

00:45:04.718 --> 00:45:06.420 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I love doing that.

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:09.056 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎My life is wonderful.

00:45:09.056 --> 00:45:12.826 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Seeing people’s faces light up 
when you teach them God’s name 

00:45:12.826 --> 00:45:15.195 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or when you tell them 
of Jehovah’s promises for us 

00:45:16.263 --> 00:45:18.766 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎fills me with great joy.

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:20.834 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎My name is Josué Martell.

00:45:20.834 --> 00:45:22.369 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I serve as a regular pioneer

00:45:22.369 --> 00:45:24.405 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and as an elder in the congregation.

00:45:26.306 --> 00:45:28.876 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Ever since I was little,

00:45:28.876 --> 00:45:31.912 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I’ve always loved playing soccer,
and that was my biggest dream.

00:45:31.912 --> 00:45:35.549 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎My goal was to become
a professional soccer player.

00:45:35.549 --> 00:45:38.485 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The truth is, setting goals
was always difficult for me

00:45:38.485 --> 00:45:41.188 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because I always had two passions,

00:45:41.188 --> 00:45:45.359 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘Am I a servant of Jehovah or an artist?’

00:45:45.359 --> 00:45:48.896 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎My goal was to become
the best gymnast in the world.

00:45:48.896 --> 00:45:50.864 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎At that moment,

00:45:50.864 --> 00:45:54.935 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎gymnastics were number one in my life.

00:45:54.935 --> 00:45:57.938 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I played at big festivals.

00:45:57.938 --> 00:46:00.674 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Standing ovations

00:46:00.674 --> 00:46:03.444 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—that was amazing.

00:46:03.444 --> 00:46:06.280 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I was surrounded by non-Witnesses

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:09.716 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎who were using drugs, 
smoking, and swearing.

00:46:09.716 --> 00:46:13.787 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎My trainer had mapped out
a complete training program

00:46:13.787 --> 00:46:17.124 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎with the Olympics as a goal.

00:46:17.124 --> 00:46:19.326 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This made me feel trapped.

00:46:19.326 --> 00:46:22.863 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I started thinking, 
‘What do I want to do with my life?’ 

00:46:22.863 --> 00:46:26.633 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎More importantly, 
‘What does Jehovah want?’

00:46:26.633 --> 00:46:29.970 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When I was studying design,
I was already a regular pioneer.

00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:31.972 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It wasn’t easy for me
to come to the understanding

00:46:31.972 --> 00:46:34.241 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that the one
who really matters is Jehovah.

00:46:34.741 --> 00:46:37.377 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When I was 16 years old, 

00:46:37.377 --> 00:46:41.815 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎different teams started offering me
high-paying contracts.

00:46:41.815 --> 00:46:44.485 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I felt a lot of pressure,
and it was a temptation

00:46:44.485 --> 00:46:47.955 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because they would constantly
call me and come to my house.

00:46:47.955 --> 00:46:51.592 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I noticed that when the players
played the sport,

00:46:51.592 --> 00:46:54.795 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎they were happy,
but afterwards they weren’t.

00:46:55.529 --> 00:46:59.299 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎My mother was in the full-time service, 
and I saw her happiness. 

00:47:00.167 --> 00:47:03.003 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That motivated me because I too wanted

00:47:03.003 --> 00:47:05.706 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to experience that lasting happiness.

00:47:05.706 --> 00:47:08.342 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I felt a little guilty
when I thought of how much of myself

00:47:08.342 --> 00:47:11.211 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I was giving to design
and art and all of that.

00:47:11.211 --> 00:47:13.981 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So that’s when I made my decision.

00:47:13.981 --> 00:47:18.118 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I decided to leave university
and focus on my service.

00:47:18.118 --> 00:47:21.688 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I realized that for a long time
I hadn’t been growing spiritually.

00:47:21.688 --> 00:47:24.691 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I prayed intensely to Jehovah.

00:47:26.026 --> 00:47:28.629 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I asked: “Do I know you?

00:47:28.629 --> 00:47:33.433 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Do I live the way you would want?”

00:47:33.433 --> 00:47:35.435 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And after that,

00:47:35.435 --> 00:47:38.438 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I stopped performing with non-Witnesses.

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:45.479 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I prayed to Jehovah.

00:47:45.479 --> 00:47:47.714 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And then, at the convention, 

00:47:47.714 --> 00:47:50.651 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we received the DVD Young People Ask
—What Will I Do With My Life? 

00:47:51.885 --> 00:47:53.887 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That really was Jehovah’s answer

00:47:53.887 --> 00:47:57.257 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to my prayer.

00:47:57.257 --> 00:47:59.259 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In the Bible it says

00:47:59.259 --> 00:48:01.261 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that “the truth will set you free.”

00:48:01.261 --> 00:48:03.263 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That freedom is something
I never used to feel.

00:48:05.165 --> 00:48:08.635 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I love working together
with other sisters in the ministry

00:48:08.635 --> 00:48:12.072 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and seeing how they share
my enthusiasm for making return visits

00:48:12.072 --> 00:48:13.907 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and conducting Bible studies.

00:48:13.907 --> 00:48:17.244 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s just wonderful to see!

00:48:17.244 --> 00:48:19.346 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎To wake up each day knowing

00:48:19.346 --> 00:48:23.750 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that I am going to do something new
for Jehovah is extraordinary.

00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:26.620 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s an unbelievable blessing;
it’s like living a dream.

00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:29.289 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I feel that I belong 
to a global organization

00:48:29.289 --> 00:48:32.426 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and we are all going
in the same direction.

00:48:32.426 --> 00:48:35.429 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s something really wonderful for me.

00:48:35.429 --> 00:48:38.665 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎To sing for Jehovah
is the most beautiful privilege

00:48:38.665 --> 00:48:40.701 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I could ever imagine.

00:48:40.701 --> 00:48:43.670 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎One of the biggest blessings

00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:45.772 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is that I have a real friendship 
with Jehovah

00:48:46.607 --> 00:48:49.743 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and friendships with my brothers and sisters
—young or old.

00:48:49.743 --> 00:48:51.712 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It doesn’t matter.

00:48:52.746 --> 00:48:55.882 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I am really happy 
that when Jehovah looks at me, 

00:48:55.882 --> 00:48:57.484 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I feel his approval.

00:48:57.484 --> 00:49:00.354 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That makes me happy.

00:49:00.354 --> 00:49:03.056 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎My trust in Jehovah has grown stronger.

00:49:03.056 --> 00:49:06.793 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The way I communicate with him
continues to improve.

00:49:06.793 --> 00:49:09.162 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And I also love my assignment

00:49:09.162 --> 00:49:12.532 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of being a regular pioneer,
an elder, and being able to support

00:49:12.532 --> 00:49:14.034 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the brothers and sisters.

00:49:14.034 --> 00:49:16.737 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎To continue to be among Jehovah’s people,

00:49:16.737 --> 00:49:18.839 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that’s the joy I was looking for

00:49:18.839 --> 00:49:21.341 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—and I found it!

00:49:22.509 --> 00:49:27.514 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The world tries to pass off the thrill 
of recognition or fame as fulfillment,

00:49:27.514 --> 00:49:29.883 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but do not be deceived. 

00:49:29.883 --> 00:49:33.720 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎These fine examples show 
that doing your best for Jehovah

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:36.456 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎leads to real contentment. 

00:49:36.456 --> 00:49:38.625 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎His smile of approval is worth

00:49:38.625 --> 00:49:42.796 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎more than any accolade 
this system of things could ever bestow. 

00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:46.133 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Satan works tirelessly

00:49:46.133 --> 00:49:49.436 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to wear us down physically and emotionally. 

00:49:49.436 --> 00:49:51.438 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How can we have the courage

00:49:51.438 --> 00:49:55.776 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to stand up to challenges 
and pressures to give up? 

00:49:55.776 --> 00:49:59.146 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The loving support 
true Christians give to one another

00:49:59.146 --> 00:50:02.549 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is illustrated in this month’s music video,

00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:06.153 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎entitled Do Not Be Afraid.

00:50:30.444 --> 00:50:39.319 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s hard to see clear
when challenges appear.

00:50:42.155 --> 00:50:50.731 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We get lost inside
the emotions we feel.

00:50:55.135 --> 00:51:00.373 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When adversity
strikes us down,

00:51:00.373 --> 00:51:05.078 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎No need to stay
on the ground.

00:51:05.078 --> 00:51:10.684 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Look up;
Reach out.

00:51:10.684 --> 00:51:17.524 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Do not be afraid,
for He is with us,

00:51:17.524 --> 00:51:22.996 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Saving us with His right hand
of righteousness.

00:51:22.996 --> 00:51:28.935 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So when it gets
hard sometimes,

00:51:28.935 --> 00:51:34.274 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We need to remember
we’re not alone.

00:51:37.410 --> 00:51:41.214 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎No, we’re never alone. 

00:51:41.214 --> 00:51:45.886 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Just pray;
Do not be afraid.

00:51:55.262 --> 00:52:04.204 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He gives us friends
who stick by our side.

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:16.783 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Their prayers of faith and love
are always right on time.

00:52:19.653 --> 00:52:25.091 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And each day
when we read His Word,

00:52:25.091 --> 00:52:30.130 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It gives us
the strength to endure.

00:52:30.130 --> 00:52:35.802 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When we’re down,
We’ll reach out.

00:52:36.937 --> 00:52:41.675 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Do not be afraid,
for He is with us,

00:52:42.676 --> 00:52:47.848 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Saving us with His right hand
of righteousness.

00:52:47.848 --> 00:52:53.119 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So when it gets
hard sometimes,

00:52:54.154 --> 00:53:00.760 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We need to remember
we’re not alone.

00:53:02.128 --> 00:53:08.134 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎No, we’re never alone.
Just pray.

00:53:09.936 --> 00:53:14.274 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So when those dark clouds
come rolling in,

00:53:15.141 --> 00:53:22.782 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Hold your head high.
It’ll be all right.

00:53:55.749 --> 00:54:01.488 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Do not be afraid,
for He is with us,

00:54:01.488 --> 00:54:06.359 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Saving us with His right hand
of righteousness.

00:54:07.027 --> 00:54:11.031 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So when it gets
hard sometimes,

00:54:12.999 --> 00:54:20.040 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We need to remember
we’re not alone.

00:54:21.207 --> 00:54:25.078 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎No, we’re never alone. 

00:54:25.078 --> 00:54:32.552 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Just pray;
Do not be afraid.

00:54:52.639 --> 00:54:55.141 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The heartfelt appeal of that song

00:54:55.141 --> 00:54:58.244 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎brings to mind the words of Isaiah 41:10,

00:54:58.244 --> 00:55:00.280 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where we’re encouraged:

00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:03.783 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Do not be afraid, for I am with you. 

00:55:03.783 --> 00:55:07.454 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Do not be anxious, for I am your God. 

00:55:07.454 --> 00:55:10.890 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I will fortify you, yes, I will help you,

00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:15.395 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I will really hold on to you 
with my right hand of righteousness.” 

00:55:16.229 --> 00:55:18.231 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Be assured that you will receive help

00:55:18.231 --> 00:55:20.266 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from our heavenly Father, Jehovah,

00:55:20.266 --> 00:55:22.268 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and from fellow believers

00:55:22.268 --> 00:55:25.271 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to resist being molded by this system.

00:55:26.673 --> 00:55:29.242 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎To conclude, 
we bring you greetings

00:55:29.242 --> 00:55:32.078 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from Maraã, 
in the state of Amazonas

00:55:32.078 --> 00:55:34.647 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in northern Brazil. 

00:55:34.647 --> 00:55:38.518 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Nestled in the Amazon rain forest
along the Japurá River,

00:55:38.518 --> 00:55:41.321 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎there are no roads leading to this city;

00:55:41.321 --> 00:55:44.991 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎it can only be reached by river. 

00:55:44.991 --> 00:55:48.995 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For most travelers, 
reaching the city is a three-day journey,

00:55:48.995 --> 00:55:52.999 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎which involves sleeping 
in hammocks along the way. 

00:55:52.999 --> 00:55:56.703 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Around 18,000 people inhabit the area,

00:55:56.703 --> 00:55:58.872 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but because of its remote location,

00:55:58.872 --> 00:56:03.576 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎many people have never had 
the opportunity to hear the good news.

00:56:03.576 --> 00:56:07.180 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎With that in mind, 
along with several other cities,

00:56:08.548 --> 00:56:12.385 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Maraã was included 
in the Amazonas national preaching campaign.

00:56:12.385 --> 00:56:16.689 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The goal of this special campaign
was to reach the thousands of people

00:56:16.689 --> 00:56:20.627 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎who live in some 
of Amazon’s most isolated areas.

00:56:20.627 --> 00:56:23.063 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As a result, 
many willing brothers and sisters

00:56:23.063 --> 00:56:27.967 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎moved here to serve 
where the need is greater.

00:56:27.967 --> 00:56:31.104 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Since the city 
is completely surrounded by rivers,

00:56:31.104 --> 00:56:35.442 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
