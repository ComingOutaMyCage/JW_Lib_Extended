during the Gilead graduation

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:41.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
held on September 8, 2018.

00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:43.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is just the opener!

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:46.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Parts 2 and 3 of the Gilead graduation program

00:00:46.362 --> 00:00:48.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be released in the upcoming weeks.

00:00:48.998 --> 00:00:51.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition to motivating Bible talks,

00:00:51.868 --> 00:00:54.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll get to know
some of the students later this month

00:00:54.904 --> 00:00:58.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you watch
another edition of The Inside Story.

00:00:58.808 --> 00:01:02.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now,
please enjoy Part 1 of the graduation

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the 145th class of Gilead.

00:01:06.116 --> 00:01:08.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what an exciting time this is

00:01:08.685 --> 00:01:10.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be here for the graduation

00:01:10.754 --> 00:01:14.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the 145th class of Gilead!

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s start by asking a question:

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:23.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What makes a graduation program of Gilead

00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:27.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
different from the various graduation programs

00:01:27.637 --> 00:01:31.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that people engage
in right throughout the earth?

00:01:31.274 --> 00:01:34.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’m sure all of us would agree,

00:01:34.077 --> 00:01:37.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
usually with regard to worldly institutions,

00:01:37.547 --> 00:01:41.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
graduation programs
are all about the accomplishments

00:01:41.284 --> 00:01:44.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and praise of individuals.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as you dear students realize,

00:01:47.223 --> 00:01:50.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Gilead program
and the training that you’ve received

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is all about glorifying Jehovah,

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s why the theme
of our introductory comments are

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Always Seek Jehovah’s Glory
and Not Your Own Glory.”

00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:05.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s in harmony
with what the Scriptures tell us.

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:09.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’d like to turn with me, please,
to the book of Romans

00:02:09.145 --> 00:02:11.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Romans chapter 12

00:02:11.714 --> 00:02:16.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice what verses 3 and 16 remind us.

00:02:16.486 --> 00:02:19.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 12:3:

00:02:19.856 --> 00:02:22.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For through the undeserved kindness
given to me,

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I tell everyone there among you

00:02:25.094 --> 00:02:28.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not to think more of himself
than it is necessary to think,

00:02:28.698 --> 00:02:31.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but to think so as to have a sound mind,

00:02:31.768 --> 00:02:35.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each one as God
has given to him a measure of faith.”

00:02:35.638 --> 00:02:37.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice the point there:

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever we have
has been given to us by Jehovah.

00:02:41.277 --> 00:02:44.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we shouldn’t think
more of ourselves than is necessary.

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:47.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then verse 16 reminds us:

00:02:47.617 --> 00:02:51.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Have the same attitude
toward others as toward yourselves;

00:02:51.387 --> 00:02:54.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“do not set your mind on lofty things,

00:02:54.691 --> 00:02:57.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but be led along with the lowly things.

00:02:57.327 --> 00:03:01.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not become wise in your own eyes.”

00:03:01.397 --> 00:03:05.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we trust that you 
fully understand that admonition

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:08.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because your Gilead training
has been helping you

00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:11.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to strengthen
your relationship with Jehovah,

00:03:11.474 --> 00:03:14.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when we know Jehovah,
we can’t help but glorify him

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we know
that any good things we have come from him.

00:03:18.815 --> 00:03:21.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, as you graduate

00:03:21.517 --> 00:03:25.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you go either back
to your former assignments

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:27.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to new assignments,

00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:30.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you may find various tests to this resolve

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:35.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that you have to always glorify
Jehovah and not yourself.

00:03:35.098 --> 00:03:37.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what might be some of those tests?

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:40.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one is perhaps an obvious test.

00:03:40.336 --> 00:03:43.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You go back maybe to your former assignment,

00:03:43.573 --> 00:03:46.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the brothers say,
“Oh, you’ve changed;

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re so much better.”

00:03:49.846 --> 00:03:52.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s humbling in itself, isn’t it?

00:03:52.115 --> 00:03:55.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You didn’t realize
how bad you were before you left.

00:03:56.853 --> 00:04:00.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And your knowledge, the illustrations,

00:04:00.223 --> 00:04:02.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the way you’re teaching seems so much better”

00:04:02.725 --> 00:04:04.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so now what’s your reaction?

00:04:04.294 --> 00:04:07.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’m sure you’re not going to say:
“You’re welcome.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I noticed that too.”

00:04:11.234 --> 00:04:13.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know (and I’m sure all of us know)

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’ll be determined
in a situation like that

00:04:17.573 --> 00:04:20.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to bring glory to Jehovah
and not to yourselves.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So perhaps that’s the easy time

00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:27.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because that’s obvious we have to be careful.

00:04:27.083 --> 00:04:30.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when is the other occasion, or situation,

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we may be tempted

00:04:32.922 --> 00:04:36.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show a measure
of pride and glorify ourselves?

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:40.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it could be if people criticize us

00:04:40.897 --> 00:04:45.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or perhaps don’t show us the respect
that we feel that we deserve.

00:04:45.068 --> 00:04:49.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe we don’t get the privileges
that we hope to receive.

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:52.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that could be a temptation for us

00:04:52.508 --> 00:04:57.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to remind everyone of the special training

00:04:57.246 --> 00:05:01.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the fact
that we graduated from that training.

00:05:01.017 --> 00:05:04.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, this is similar

00:05:04.654 --> 00:05:07.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the trap that Job fell into.

00:05:07.824 --> 00:05:10.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when we think of Job,

00:05:10.493 --> 00:05:14.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we think of a very faithful man
—a man of integrity.

00:05:14.364 --> 00:05:17.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The two words go together:
Job and integrity.

00:05:17.867 --> 00:05:22.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we also realize that Job
needed to have very strong counsel.

00:05:22.872 --> 00:05:26.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, at what point in his life

00:05:26.042 --> 00:05:30.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did he do something
that warranted him getting counsel?

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:32.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s think about it.

00:05:32.115 --> 00:05:34.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We won’t read the verses
because you know them well,

00:05:34.884 --> 00:05:39.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in chapter 1,
remember that Job lost everything

00:05:39.022 --> 00:05:43.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his children and his possessions
one after the other.

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:47.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when we look at Job 1:22,

00:05:47.096 --> 00:05:51.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it tells us there that “Job did not sin.”

00:05:51.067 --> 00:05:54.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t “accuse God
of doing anything wrong.”

00:05:54.103 --> 00:05:57.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So all these horrific things happened to him.

00:05:57.006 --> 00:06:01.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had these huge tests,
and he came out looking pretty good.

00:06:01.644 --> 00:06:04.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He hadn’t sinned at that point.

00:06:04.347 --> 00:06:06.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So then what happened in the second round?

00:06:06.983 --> 00:06:10.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you remember
that he had this loathsome disease,

00:06:10.887 --> 00:06:14.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then his wife said to him,
“Curse God and die!”

00:06:14.424 --> 00:06:17.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, is that when he deserved some counsel?

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:06:18.361 --> 00:06:20.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 2 of Job and verse 10,

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it tells us
that he “did not sin with his lips.”

00:06:24.534 --> 00:06:28.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So at that point,
he was winning we might say.

00:06:28.337 --> 00:06:31.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He proved himself an integrity keeper.

00:06:31.574 --> 00:06:36.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when was it
that he started to make a few mistakes

00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:39.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that resulted in getting that strong counsel?

00:06:39.215 --> 00:06:43.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, The Watchtower, back in 1980, tells us.

00:06:43.052 --> 00:06:46.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said that it was
when these three so-called friends

00:06:46.556 --> 00:06:48.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
started to criticize him and said:

00:06:48.558 --> 00:06:50.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Maybe you did this.
Maybe you did that.

00:06:50.593 --> 00:06:53.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the—
There’s a reason.’

00:06:53.062 --> 00:06:55.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then The Watchtower said

00:06:55.298 --> 00:06:58.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that because of these false accusations,

00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:01.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s as if it pushed Job over the edge

00:07:01.604 --> 00:07:06.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he vigorously determined to justify himself

00:07:06.476 --> 00:07:09.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though that inferred 
that maybe Jehovah

00:07:09.145 --> 00:07:11.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wasn’t treating him correctly.

00:07:11.414 --> 00:07:13.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So do we see that this is a situation

00:07:13.983 --> 00:07:18.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where if we are criticized
or some false accusations are made about us,

00:07:18.888 --> 00:07:22.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then all of a sudden,
the self-justification can come in?

00:07:22.291 --> 00:07:25.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what is self-justification?

00:07:25.328 --> 00:07:30.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Glorifying ourselves
rather than glorifying Jehovah.

00:07:30.333 --> 00:07:34.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, our Lord Jesus Christ
is an excellent example in that regard.

00:07:34.971 --> 00:07:37.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s have a look at the record

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:40.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recorded in John chapter 8

00:07:40.977 --> 00:07:45.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—John 8:48-50.

00:07:45.214 --> 00:07:48.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now here,
we have a group of Jewish persons

00:07:48.751 --> 00:07:52.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
criticizing Jesus,
falsely accusing him of something.

00:07:52.288 --> 00:07:54.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice there in verse 48:

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In answer the Jews said to him
[that is, to Jesus]:

00:07:57.927 --> 00:08:02.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Are we not right in saying,
“You are a Samaritan

00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:04.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“[now, you remember that’s not a compliment]

00:08:04.167 --> 00:08:05.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have a demon”?’”

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:08.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On another occasion,
they said, ‘You’re out of your mind.’

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:11.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, what did Jesus do?

00:08:11.607 --> 00:08:16.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he fall into the trap
that Job fell into and try to justify himself?

00:08:16.512 --> 00:08:20.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.
He just made a simple comment in verse 49:

00:08:20.082 --> 00:08:25.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I do not have a demon,
but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.”

00:08:25.087 --> 00:08:30.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he says:
“But I am not seeking glory for myself;

00:08:30.092 --> 00:08:33.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is One who is seeking and judging.”

00:08:33.896 --> 00:08:37.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see the excellent example
of our Lord Jesus

00:08:37.066 --> 00:08:40.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in that difficult situation,
where he was falsely accused

00:08:40.803 --> 00:08:44.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yet still focused on glorifying Jehovah.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the lesson there for each one of us

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not only yourselves but all of us?

00:08:50.746 --> 00:08:54.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you don’t need to remind other people

00:08:54.917 --> 00:08:58.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you graduated from Gilead,

00:08:58.254 --> 00:09:01.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you don’t need to try to impress others

00:09:01.991 --> 00:09:03.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get their respect,

00:09:03.993 --> 00:09:07.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you don’t need to praise yourself.

00:09:07.463 --> 00:09:10.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What should be the goal of all of us?

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:13.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, our final scripture
that we want to share with you

00:09:13.202 --> 00:09:16.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are the words of Jesus
as recorded in Matthew

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:21.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Matthew 5:16:

00:09:21.477 --> 00:09:25.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Likewise, let your light shine before men,

00:09:25.848 --> 00:09:29.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that they may see your fine works

00:09:29.452 --> 00:09:33.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and give glory to your Father
who is in the heavens.”

00:09:33.856 --> 00:09:35.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful goal!

00:09:35.858 --> 00:09:39.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, the goal is that we don’t glorify ourselves,

00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:43.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we give all the glory to Jehovah God.

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:44.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So with that in mind,

00:09:44.734 --> 00:09:47.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to look forward
to our wonderful program.

00:09:47.169 --> 00:09:49.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve got a number
of brothers who put a lot of effort

00:09:49.905 --> 00:09:53.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in thinking about what they
would like to convey to you

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:55.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before you go to your assignments.

00:09:55.244 --> 00:09:58.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the first of these brothers
is Brother John Ekrann.

00:09:58.614 --> 00:10:01.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The theme that he selected is

00:10:01.183 --> 00:10:05.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What Will You Do in the Year of the Drought?”

00:10:15.931 --> 00:10:19.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You students 
are really like beautiful trees

00:10:19.702 --> 00:10:23.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
planted along the river Gilead.

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:25.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah 17:8

00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:28.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
describes such beautiful trees.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:32.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read that together,
Jeremiah 17:8.

00:10:32.481 --> 00:10:36.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “He will become
like a tree planted by the waters,

00:10:36.419 --> 00:10:39.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that sends out its roots to the stream.

00:10:39.655 --> 00:10:42.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He will not notice when heat comes,

00:10:42.358 --> 00:10:45.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but his leaves will always flourish.

00:10:45.094 --> 00:10:49.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And in the year of drought
he will not be anxious,

00:10:49.198 --> 00:10:53.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor will he quit producing fruit.”

00:10:53.002 --> 00:10:55.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you’ve enjoyed
the spiritual waters

00:10:55.705 --> 00:10:58.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taught here at Gilead.

00:10:58.407 --> 00:11:02.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as you graduate today
and you go off to your assignments,

00:11:02.645 --> 00:11:05.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your leaves are flourishing

00:11:05.181 --> 00:11:08.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’re producing fruit,
figuratively speaking.

00:11:09.585 --> 00:11:12.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, did you notice,
though, in verse 8

00:11:12.154 --> 00:11:15.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what the righteous trees
had to deal with?

00:11:15.691 --> 00:11:19.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says “when [the] heat comes”

00:11:19.228 --> 00:11:22.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “in the year of drought.”

00:11:22.832 --> 00:11:27.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it doesn’t say if the heat comes
but when the heat comes.

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:31.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what is that heat
and year of drought?

00:11:31.607 --> 00:11:34.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While there are many forms
of heat we deal with

00:11:34.076 --> 00:11:38.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and in addition to what you 
considered about this verse in class),

00:11:38.214 --> 00:11:42.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to focus 
on one particular form of heat,

00:11:42.518 --> 00:11:45.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that is persecution.

00:11:45.721 --> 00:11:49.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Restrictions on our work and bans

00:11:49.191 --> 00:11:52.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are designed to create fear.

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:56.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Negative articles in the media
about Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:11:56.465 --> 00:12:00.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are designed to create doubt.

00:12:00.169 --> 00:12:02.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Religious leaders and opposers

00:12:02.705 --> 00:12:05.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they attack our neutrality,

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:09.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our clear support for the Bible’s view
of sex and marriage,

00:12:09.912 --> 00:12:14.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or discipline by disfellowshipping,
and other matters.

00:12:14.016 --> 00:12:16.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And add to that,
some of our brothers

00:12:16.018 --> 00:12:18.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are being rounded up
and thrown into prison.

00:12:18.754 --> 00:12:23.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can say that Satan
has truly “turned up the heat.”

00:12:24.593 --> 00:12:26.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will happen to the trees?

00:12:26.796 --> 00:12:28.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will fear and doubt cause them

00:12:28.931 --> 00:12:31.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to shrivel up and die
during the drought?

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.
If you notice there in verse 8,

00:12:34.503 --> 00:12:38.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah says that the righteous
‘will not notice the heat’

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:42.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ‘not be anxious in the drought.’

00:12:42.645 --> 00:12:44.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, why is Jehovah confident

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the righteous trees
won’t notice the heat

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and won’t wither up
in the drought?

00:12:50.152 --> 00:12:53.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at verse 7
of Jeremiah 17.

00:12:53.556 --> 00:12:58.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Blessed is the man
who puts his trust in Jehovah,

00:12:58.227 --> 00:13:03.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whose confidence is in Jehovah.”

00:13:03.232 --> 00:13:07.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what will you do
in the year of drought?

00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:11.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trust in Jehovah.

00:13:11.307 --> 00:13:15.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan wants to destroy 
our trust in Jehovah.

00:13:15.311 --> 00:13:17.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right from the very first with Eve:

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:20.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Is it really so?”

00:13:20.416 --> 00:13:24.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His whole system is built on fear,

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
uncertainty, and doubt.

00:13:28.123 --> 00:13:32.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Persecution—we could liken it
to when you’re in an airplane;

00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:34.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it has some turbulence;
and it begins to shake.

00:13:34.964 --> 00:13:36.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One flight I was on,

00:13:36.966 --> 00:13:40.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was one woman
that cried in terror.

00:13:40.836 --> 00:13:45.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She screamed out loud every time
the plane shook even just a little.

00:13:45.841 --> 00:13:49.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was genuinely terrified.

00:13:49.011 --> 00:13:51.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt sorry for her.

00:13:51.347 --> 00:13:53.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the experienced flyers

00:13:53.349 --> 00:13:56.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they were eating,
reading, watching movies;

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:59.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they didn’t even notice
the turbulence.

00:13:59.722 --> 00:14:01.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?
Well, from experience,

00:14:01.924 --> 00:14:04.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they knew
that the plane could easily handle

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such a small amount of turbulence,
and they were not worried.

00:14:08.631 --> 00:14:11.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was designed for that.

00:14:11.367 --> 00:14:14.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we are like experienced flyers.

00:14:14.603 --> 00:14:16.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t let the turbulence,

00:14:16.605 --> 00:14:19.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or persecution, of this system

00:14:19.608 --> 00:14:23.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cause us fear or doubt.

00:14:23.178 --> 00:14:25.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah and Jesus
as our pilots,

00:14:25.247 --> 00:14:27.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we don’t need to be anxious,
do we?

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:31.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider two ways 
that we can show trust in Jehovah

00:14:31.687 --> 00:14:33.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Jeremiah 17:7 says.

00:14:33.689 --> 00:14:37.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, we’re going to talk about trusting
“the faithful and discreet slave”

00:14:37.092 --> 00:14:40.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and trusting Bible principles.

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:43.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s talk first about trusting
the faithful and discreet slave.

00:14:43.699 --> 00:14:45.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The faithful and discreet slave

00:14:45.701 --> 00:14:49.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been selected
and appointed by Jehovah,

00:14:49.238 --> 00:14:52.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and experience has shown
that we can trust them.

00:14:52.908 --> 00:14:57.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trust is built
by repeated good experiences.

00:14:57.913 --> 00:15:01.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of all
the good experiences we’ve had

00:15:01.083 --> 00:15:05.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the faithful and discreet slave
and following their direction.

00:15:05.588 --> 00:15:07.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, some might reason:

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:10.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, you know, the direction
from the faithful and discreet slave

00:15:10.392 --> 00:15:14.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘is good for the United States,
but they don’t understand here.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:18.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘They don’t understand my assignment
where I’ve been assigned.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to do things differently.’

00:15:22.171 --> 00:15:26.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trust in the faithful and discreet slave
is not geographical.

00:15:26.942 --> 00:15:30.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s direction 
through the faithful and discreet slave

00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:34.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
applies to all of God’s people
all over the earth.

00:15:36.251 --> 00:15:39.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fear is really a loss of memory

00:15:39.755 --> 00:15:43.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what Jehovah has done for us.

00:15:43.392 --> 00:15:45.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan wants us to forget

00:15:45.794 --> 00:15:49.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the good experiences we’ve had
with the faithful and discreet slave

00:15:49.498 --> 00:15:52.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let one moment of fear get to us

00:15:52.167 --> 00:15:55.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cause us to wither in the heat.

00:15:55.337 --> 00:15:58.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Thessalonians 2:2 says

00:15:58.307 --> 00:16:02.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not to be quickly shaken 
from your reason nor to be alarmed,”

00:16:02.845 --> 00:16:05.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially at rumors.

00:16:05.347 --> 00:16:08.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, your trust 
in the faithful and discreet slave

00:16:08.651 --> 00:16:10.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is going to be put to the test.

00:16:10.653 --> 00:16:13.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan will make sure of that.

00:16:13.489 --> 00:16:17.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could be your own thoughts 
of ‘I know better,’

00:16:17.126 --> 00:16:21.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or maybe some twisted lies
you read or hear.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:24.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Either way, it’s a trap.

00:16:24.433 --> 00:16:27.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay away from such ideas.

00:16:27.469 --> 00:16:32.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trust what you know
about the faithful and discreet slave.

00:16:32.474 --> 00:16:35.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Isaiah 30:15 says:

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:37.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Your strength will be

00:16:37.112 --> 00:16:41.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in keeping calm and showing trust.”

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:43.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, 
the faithful and discreet slave

00:16:43.986 --> 00:16:46.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been selected 
and appointed by Jehovah,

00:16:46.989 --> 00:16:51.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our experience 
has shown that we can trust them.

00:16:52.695 --> 00:16:57.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s consider
trusting Bible principles, our second point.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bible principles

00:16:59.768 --> 00:17:03.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are timeless pearls
of wisdom from Jehovah.

00:17:03.372 --> 00:17:06.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But many people today
attack our decision

00:17:06.508 --> 00:17:09.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to live by Bible principles
in this modern world.

00:17:09.278 --> 00:17:11.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They say, “That’s outdated.”

00:17:11.647 --> 00:17:14.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, we trust Bible principles

00:17:14.883 --> 00:17:19.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because experience tells us
they always work.

00:17:19.488 --> 00:17:22.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked one sister what helps her to be calm

00:17:22.091 --> 00:17:24.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in very difficult, or trying, situations.

00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:28.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she said, “Give me a scripture.”

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:30.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus’ mother, Mary,

00:17:30.332 --> 00:17:33.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had that same
“give-me-a-scripture” attitude.

00:17:33.535 --> 00:17:37.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Luke 2:51 says 
that Mary made it her habit

00:17:37.239 --> 00:17:40.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep “these sayings in her heart.”

00:17:40.042 --> 00:17:44.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mary was really like a tree,
soaking in all of these waters

00:17:44.179 --> 00:17:47.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jesus’ teachings 
and his amazing miracles.

00:17:47.483 --> 00:17:52.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the heat for Mary came 
when the Pharisees and Sadducees,

00:17:52.154 --> 00:17:54.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe even her own family,

00:17:54.156 --> 00:17:56.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and her neighbors began to attack Jesus,

00:17:56.825 --> 00:18:00.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
call him names, slander his reputation,

00:18:00.129 --> 00:18:02.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and attack his motives.

00:18:02.564 --> 00:18:07.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped Mary
to deal with the heat?

00:18:07.402 --> 00:18:11.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those waters
that she had treasured up in her heart.

00:18:13.609 --> 00:18:16.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What Bible principles
and experiences

00:18:16.879 --> 00:18:19.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are you keeping
in your heart

00:18:19.314 --> 00:18:23.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help you 
when you come under attack?

00:18:23.452 --> 00:18:26.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be like Mary and keep in your heart

00:18:26.955 --> 00:18:31.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your good experiences
in applying Bible principles.

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:35.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stick to what you know works
—Bible principles.

00:18:35.697 --> 00:18:39.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They always work,
and they never get out of date.

00:18:39.368 --> 00:18:41.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not you or anyone else

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can come up
with better principles to live by.

00:18:44.273 --> 00:18:48.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, we trust Bible principles

00:18:48.143 --> 00:18:50.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they come from Jehovah

00:18:50.579 --> 00:18:55.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our own experience tells us 
they always work.

00:18:55.484 --> 00:18:58.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, trusting 
the faithful and discreet slave

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and trusting the Bible

00:19:00.556 --> 00:19:03.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are just two of many ways

00:19:03.959 --> 00:19:07.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can show
that we trust Jehovah.

00:19:07.362 --> 00:19:10.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what will you do
in the year of drought?

00:19:10.599 --> 00:19:13.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trust in Jehovah.

00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:15.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of the birds.

00:19:15.671 --> 00:19:17.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they’re flying high up there,
are they worried?

00:19:17.673 --> 00:19:20.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Oh, I think I’m going to fall.
I’m really worried.’

00:19:20.509 --> 00:19:23.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, no.
Birds don’t worry about that, do they?

00:19:23.312 --> 00:19:27.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why? Well, they rely on the wings
and instincts Jehovah gave them.

00:19:27.983 --> 00:19:29.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They can fly.

00:19:29.985 --> 00:19:34.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, we don’t need to be anxious
when faced with lies,

00:19:34.489 --> 00:19:38.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bans, or attacks
on our Bible principles.

00:19:38.794 --> 00:19:42.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has given us 
what we need to fly, so to speak

00:19:42.464 --> 00:19:45.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the faithful and discreet slave,
Bible principles,

00:19:45.734 --> 00:19:49.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prayer,
holy spirit, and more.

00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:51.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we head further into this system

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:56.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as the heat
from this system intensifies, remember,

00:19:56.211 --> 00:19:59.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fear and doubt are reactions,

00:19:59.781 --> 00:20:04.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but our decision
is trust and courage.

00:20:14.363 --> 00:20:16.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, thank you very much, Brother Ekrann.

00:20:16.832 --> 00:20:18.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really appreciated that.

00:20:18.834 --> 00:20:21.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I neglected to mention that Brother Ekrann

00:20:21.203 --> 00:20:23.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a helper to the Coordinators’ Committee.

00:20:23.939 --> 00:20:28.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As chairman, you’d probably appreciate
that it’s hard for me to take notes.

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:30.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are a few other things
that I’m worried about.

00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:33.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I did jot down a few things here:

00:20:33.015 --> 00:20:35.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Drought won’t make us doubt.

00:20:35.183 --> 00:20:37.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trust is a must.”

00:20:37.185 --> 00:20:41.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So hopefully, I’ve got something
I’ll remember from Brother Ekrann’s talk.

00:20:42.224 --> 00:20:46.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now Brother William Turner,
who is a helper to the Service Committee,

00:20:46.194 --> 00:20:48.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is giving us a challenging question.

00:20:48.497 --> 00:20:52.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The theme is
“Have You Become a Different Person?”

00:20:56.004 --> 00:20:58.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I think it’s safe to say

00:20:58.006 --> 00:21:02.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that with all of the training
and instruction you’ve received,

00:21:02.344 --> 00:21:05.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you definitely are not
the same individuals you were

00:21:05.948 --> 00:21:08.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you first arrived at Patterson.

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:12.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how exactly have you changed,

00:21:12.988 --> 00:21:17.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and why is it important
that you continue to do so?

00:21:17.693 --> 00:21:20.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s consider this
by looking at someone who,

00:21:20.762 --> 00:21:24.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just like you,
received a special privilege.

00:21:25.067 --> 00:21:30.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His privilege was being
the first divinely selected king of Israel.

00:21:31.106 --> 00:21:33.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the man was Saul.

00:21:33.775 --> 00:21:35.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Saul was anointed,

00:21:35.777 --> 00:21:39.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the prophet Samuel
gave him three prophetic signs

00:21:39.481 --> 00:21:42.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to confirm
that Jehovah was with him.

00:21:42.451 --> 00:21:44.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I invite you
to turn with me in your Bibles,

00:21:44.486 --> 00:21:47.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please,
to 1 Samuel chapter 10.

00:21:47.856 --> 00:21:52.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we read verse 6,
note what was to happen after the last sign.

00:21:56.164 --> 00:21:58.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chapter 10, verse 6, says:

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:02.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The spirit of Jehovah
will empower you,

00:22:02.571 --> 00:22:05.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and you will prophesy
along with them

00:22:05.607 --> 00:22:10.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be changed
into a different person.”

00:22:11.146 --> 00:22:13.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what did this change mean?

00:22:13.982 --> 00:22:17.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would Saul all of a sudden
become unrecognizable?

00:22:17.319 --> 00:22:21.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or would there be
a drastic change in his personality?

00:22:21.423 --> 00:22:24.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s go back
one chapter to chapter 9.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:28.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 21, here we get
a glimpse of Saul’s personality

00:22:28.096 --> 00:22:31.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before he was appointed as king.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 21 says:
“At this Saul answered:

00:22:35.137 --> 00:22:40.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Am I not a Benjaminite
of the smallest of the tribes of Israel,

00:22:40.075 --> 00:22:42.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and my family
the most insignificant

00:22:42.677 --> 00:22:45.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘of all the families
of the tribe of Benjamin?

00:22:45.414 --> 00:22:48.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why have you spoken
to me in this way?’”

00:22:48.717 --> 00:22:52.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Saul shows himself
to be a very humble,

00:22:52.387 --> 00:22:55.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
modest individual.

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:59.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how about 
after his appointment as king?

00:22:59.127 --> 00:23:01.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go back to chapter 10.

00:23:01.229 --> 00:23:03.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you look in verse 22,

00:23:03.598 --> 00:23:08.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here we see Saul’s introduction 
as king to the people.

00:23:08.537 --> 00:23:11.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 22 says: 
“So they inquired of Jehovah:

00:23:11.273 --> 00:23:13.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Has the man come here yet?’

00:23:13.375 --> 00:23:16.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah answered: ‘There he is

00:23:16.545 --> 00:23:20.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hiding himself among the luggage.’”

00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:25.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so evidently still modest, 
still humble.

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, 
the Insight book mentions

00:23:28.023 --> 00:23:30.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that about a month
after his appointment as king,

00:23:30.892 --> 00:23:34.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saul gained a couple
of great military victorie

00:23:34.162 --> 00:23:37.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against the Ammonites
and later against the Philistines.

00:23:37.899 --> 00:23:40.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, you think about that.

00:23:40.202 --> 00:23:44.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did Saul change,
and rather quickly,

00:23:44.039 --> 00:23:48.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from bashfully hiding
among luggage

00:23:48.443 --> 00:23:51.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to leading a nation to victory?

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:54.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is evidence

00:23:54.983 --> 00:23:57.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the power of God’s spirit

00:23:57.986 --> 00:24:01.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the impact that it can have

00:24:01.223 --> 00:24:05.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when one allows it 
to be operative in their lives.

00:24:05.026 --> 00:24:07.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the lesson?

00:24:07.429 --> 00:24:10.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of you 
have manifested qualities

00:24:10.132 --> 00:24:13.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are very pleasing 
and useful to Jehovah.

00:24:13.301 --> 00:24:15.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has allowed you 
to be productive in your assignment.

00:24:15.837 --> 00:24:19.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s allowed you to now have 
this privilege of Gilead training.

00:24:19.007 --> 00:24:22.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as you now
go to your assignments,

00:24:22.544 --> 00:24:25.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re going to continue to need

00:24:25.814 --> 00:24:29.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have that spirit 
operative in your life.

00:24:29.017 --> 00:24:31.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just as we’ve seen 
in the case of Saul,

00:24:31.419 --> 00:24:35.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will not always mean 
a drastic change in your personality.

00:24:35.991 --> 00:24:38.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps when we think 
of that expression

00:24:38.126 --> 00:24:39.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of someone 
becoming a different person,

00:24:39.828 --> 00:24:41.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe that’s where our mind goes

00:24:41.663 --> 00:24:44.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to someone 
who has come out of Satan’s world,

00:24:44.065 --> 00:24:47.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now into Jehovah’s organization,
and they put on the new personality.

00:24:47.169 --> 00:24:49.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s correct.

00:24:49.571 --> 00:24:54.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the reality is that all Christians,

00:24:54.543 --> 00:24:57.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even those spiritually mature,

00:24:57.979 --> 00:25:01.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
need to be adjusted from time to time,

00:25:01.449 --> 00:25:05.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and those adjustments 
can have a tremendous impact.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps your personality is such

00:25:08.323 --> 00:25:11.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you are
naturally shy and reserved.

00:25:11.159 --> 00:25:15.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you would be quite comfortable,
no problem, staying with the luggage.

00:25:15.397 --> 00:25:19.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now having God’s spirit

00:25:19.701 --> 00:25:22.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
coupled with appreciation
for what you’ve learned

00:25:22.971 --> 00:25:27.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now perhaps move you
to come out of your comfort zone

00:25:27.275 --> 00:25:31.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to initiate ways to share things
that you’ve learned with others.

00:25:31.947 --> 00:25:36.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe before you came to Gilead, 
you had very good leadership skills.

00:25:36.685 --> 00:25:39.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You had a take-charge personality
—one who got things done.

00:25:41.389 --> 00:25:44.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now you may see 
the need to adjust.

00:25:44.726 --> 00:25:47.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You recognize there is wisdom

00:25:47.562 --> 00:25:51.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in perhaps slowing down, 
or even waiting,

00:25:51.833 --> 00:25:54.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps even seeking input 
from others.

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:57.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the help of God’s spirit,

00:25:57.138 --> 00:25:59.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it can help you 
to become a kinder overseer,

00:25:59.975 --> 00:26:02.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a better shepherd, 
one who is more tolerant,

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:03.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
empathetic of others.

00:26:03.979 --> 00:26:06.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just tremendous benefits 
all the way around.

00:26:06.815 --> 00:26:11.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the extent 
that you become different

00:26:11.453 --> 00:26:15.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
depends upon you
and your response to God’s spirit.

00:26:17.292 --> 00:26:21.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, obviously, we know Saul’s story;
it does not end well.

00:26:21.196 --> 00:26:24.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of maintaining 
his reliance on Jehovah,

00:26:24.399 --> 00:26:27.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he begins 
to trust his own judgment.

00:26:27.135 --> 00:26:30.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He focuses more 
on his position as king

00:26:30.839 --> 00:26:33.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than he does 
on his relationship with God.

00:26:33.942 --> 00:26:37.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s quite interesting, 
if you are still in chapter 10,

00:26:37.078 --> 00:26:41.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you look in verse 27,
where Saul had God’s spirit

00:26:41.416 --> 00:26:43.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when he encountered challenges

00:26:43.918 --> 00:26:46.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in this particular case, 
some questioning his appointment—

00:26:46.855 --> 00:26:49.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll notice 
that Saul didn’t feel the need

00:26:49.157 --> 00:26:52.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prove himself 
or challenge the men.

00:26:52.961 --> 00:26:57.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He just stayed silent 
and focused on his assignment.

00:26:57.932 --> 00:27:01.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you read a little later
that when he lost God’s spirit

00:27:01.102 --> 00:27:03.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when that bad spirit 
began to take over him,

00:27:03.705 --> 00:27:07.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, now the negative comments
—the comments of others:

00:27:07.342 --> 00:27:10.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Saul has struck down his thousands 
and David his tens of thousands”

00:27:10.812 --> 00:27:14.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—oh, well, now it’s an issue.

00:27:14.249 --> 00:27:16.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a problem.

00:27:16.718 --> 00:27:18.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It affected his judgment;

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it affected his emotions

00:27:21.489 --> 00:27:24.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and caused him to make bad decisions.

00:27:24.426 --> 00:27:27.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what can help you 
to avoid that

00:27:27.696 --> 00:27:29.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to keep your focus?

00:27:29.964 --> 00:27:32.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s look at the example

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:35.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the other Saul 
that’s mentioned in the Bible

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:37.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the man who later 
became the apostle Paul.

00:27:37.939 --> 00:27:41.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we know, obviously, Paul’s personality
needed more than a refinement.

00:27:41.876 --> 00:27:44.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul needed a complete overhaul.

00:27:44.346 --> 00:27:49.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he truly became a different person 
by way of God’s spirit.

00:27:49.117 --> 00:27:52.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he was given a privilege
to serve as “an apostle to the nations.”

00:27:52.754 --> 00:27:56.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you turn 
to 1 Corinthians chapter 15,

00:27:56.391 --> 00:28:00.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s just note 
the attitude that Paul showed.

00:28:00.795 --> 00:28:04.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 Corinthians 15:9,

00:28:04.466 --> 00:28:08.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he says:
“For I am the least of the apostles,

00:28:08.737 --> 00:28:11.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I’m not worthy 
of being called an apostle,

00:28:11.206 --> 00:28:13.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because I persecuted 
the congregation of God.

00:28:13.908 --> 00:28:16.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But by God’s undeserved kindness

00:28:16.978 --> 00:28:20.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am what I am.”

00:28:20.081 --> 00:28:22.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beautiful perspective, isn’t it?

00:28:22.484 --> 00:28:25.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why do you think Paul was able

00:28:25.754 --> 00:28:29.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to maintain this humble attitude 
for the rest of his life,

00:28:29.657 --> 00:28:32.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whereas King Saul could not?

00:28:32.761 --> 00:28:35.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, both men knew

00:28:35.263 --> 00:28:38.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it was only by means 
of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness

00:28:38.233 --> 00:28:41.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they could enjoy 
their privilege of service.

00:28:41.136 --> 00:28:46.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Paul never viewed 
his privilege of service

00:28:46.074 --> 00:28:50.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
greater than 
his relationship with God.

00:28:50.678 --> 00:28:54.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why he studied, he meditated,

00:28:54.616 --> 00:28:57.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he discerned God’s will for him,

00:28:57.385 --> 00:29:01.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then he was alert 
to follow the leadings of God’s spirit.

00:29:01.589 --> 00:29:04.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in his assignment,
Paul had challenges.

00:29:04.159 --> 00:29:06.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You remember, 
early on for parts of three years,

00:29:06.027 --> 00:29:09.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of the brothers
didn’t even believe he was an apostle.

00:29:09.097 --> 00:29:12.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But yet he never
asserted his authority.

00:29:12.967 --> 00:29:17.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never distanced himself
from his brothers;

00:29:17.972 --> 00:29:20.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he just loved them.

00:29:20.675 --> 00:29:25.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He let his example speak for him,
and you can do the same.

00:29:25.413 --> 00:29:28.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, let the brothers feel.

00:29:28.383 --> 00:29:32.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let them see the love
that you have for Jehovah

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:35.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the love that you have for them.

00:29:35.356 --> 00:29:39.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in review, maintain
those wonderful traits

00:29:39.227 --> 00:29:43.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that qualified you for Gilead,
like your modesty and humility.

00:29:43.598 --> 00:29:46.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then study, meditate,

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
continue to follow
the leadings of God’s spirit.

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:52.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when it becomes apparent
that changes need to be made

00:29:52.607 --> 00:29:56.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
either for the sake of the work
or peace with your brother,

00:29:56.311 --> 00:29:59.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, please
be willing to make them.

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:01.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you do, you will show

00:30:01.583 --> 00:30:04.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you have become
a different person

00:30:04.018 --> 00:30:07.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one who is refined,
one who is useful,

00:30:07.155 --> 00:30:10.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one who is dearly loved
by Jehovah.

00:30:10.892 --> 00:30:13.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And may Jehovah
continue to bless you

00:30:13.294 --> 00:30:15.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all of the hard work 
that you do

00:30:15.396 --> 00:30:17.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in behalf of his name.

00:30:27.075 --> 00:30:29.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much, Brother Turner.

00:30:29.244 --> 00:30:30.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really appreciated that.

00:30:30.979 --> 00:30:32.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So my quick notes:

00:30:32.981 --> 00:30:35.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Don’t change the change.

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:38.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Continue to make the right change.”

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:41.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good.
Well, now we have the privilege of listening

00:30:41.089 --> 00:30:44.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a member of the Governing Body,
Brother Kenneth Cook.

00:30:44.726 --> 00:30:47.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Brother Cook
is going to talk to us on the theme

00:30:47.595 --> 00:30:51.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Find Joy in Jehovah’s Gradual Blessing!”

00:30:53.601 --> 00:30:56.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you know from your own life experience

00:30:56.838 --> 00:30:59.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and from your Gilead instruction,

00:30:59.407 --> 00:31:02.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is a God of action.

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:06.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as such,
he does some things quickly, doesn’t he?

00:31:06.347 --> 00:31:10.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s true when it’s needed,
or it’s warranted.

00:31:10.184 --> 00:31:14.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He makes sure it happens
just at the right time.

00:31:14.122 --> 00:31:16.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:31:16.124 --> 00:31:18.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when a sudden stiff breeze

00:31:18.359 --> 00:31:20.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rushed into the upper room at Pentecost,

00:31:20.995 --> 00:31:24.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those present were filled with holy spirit.

00:31:24.732 --> 00:31:26.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In another example,

00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:30.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible tells us
that when this world in some way says

00:31:30.471 --> 00:31:33.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it has achieved “peace and security,”

00:31:33.575 --> 00:31:35.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what happens next?

00:31:35.577 --> 00:31:38.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Thessalonians 5:3 says

00:31:38.913 --> 00:31:43.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ‘sudden destruction
will come instantly on them.’

00:31:44.819 --> 00:31:47.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But not all things that Jehovah

00:31:47.722 --> 00:31:50.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
causes to happen occur so quickly.

00:31:50.792 --> 00:31:54.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, he often does things gradually.

00:31:54.195 --> 00:31:57.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at two examples

00:31:57.131 --> 00:31:59.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see what we can learn from them.

00:31:59.467 --> 00:32:03.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, we will look
at the angels and creation,

00:32:03.972 --> 00:32:08.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then resurrected ones and perfection.

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:13.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, we will look
at how this applies to you

00:32:13.114 --> 00:32:15.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how you can find great joy

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:17.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a gradual blessing.

00:32:18.553 --> 00:32:21.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We begin with the angels
who were on hand

00:32:21.155 --> 00:32:24.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah made
the earth and all the things in it.

00:32:24.892 --> 00:32:27.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did the angels see?

00:32:27.228 --> 00:32:30.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did they see an instant burst

00:32:30.231 --> 00:32:32.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of unimaginable power

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that suddenly formed 
the earth and all life on it?

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:37.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not at all.

00:32:37.772 --> 00:32:40.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah could have done that,

00:32:40.375 --> 00:32:44.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but instead he created things gradually.

00:32:44.078 --> 00:32:48.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Job 38:5, 6

00:32:48.116 --> 00:32:51.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
speak of him as setting
the earth’s “measurements,”

00:32:51.319 --> 00:32:53.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sinking “its pedestals,”

00:32:53.721 --> 00:32:57.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and laying “its cornerstone.”

00:32:57.091 --> 00:33:00.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in Genesis chapters 1 and 2,

00:33:00.161 --> 00:33:03.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we also read
about how he gradually brought forth

00:33:03.665 --> 00:33:07.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
life on earth and ultimately humans.

00:33:08.603 --> 00:33:12.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine the joy
that his angelic sons experienced

00:33:12.707 --> 00:33:16.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they watched
what Jehovah was gradually doing.

00:33:16.577 --> 00:33:20.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, undoubtedly,
the angels could see

00:33:20.114 --> 00:33:23.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that their heavenly Father
received great satisfaction

00:33:23.451 --> 00:33:26.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a job well done.

00:33:26.888 --> 00:33:28.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would also learn about facets

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:32.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s marvelous personality

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:35.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they observed everything
from the first whale

00:33:35.329 --> 00:33:37.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
breaching the surface of an ocean

00:33:37.999 --> 00:33:41.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a hummingbird hovering
over a beautiful flower

00:33:41.703 --> 00:33:45.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or seeing lion cubs playing together.

00:33:46.574 --> 00:33:49.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So stupendous was Jehovah’s work

00:33:49.577 --> 00:33:53.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so enriching this experience
for his angelic sons,

00:33:53.981 --> 00:33:57.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Job 38:7 tells us

00:33:57.452 --> 00:33:59.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that at some point,

00:33:59.454 --> 00:34:02.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on seeing all of this 
and seeing the earth formed,

00:34:02.457 --> 00:34:05.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they “began shouting in applause.”

00:34:06.761 --> 00:34:09.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That gradual blessing

00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:12.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is something that the faithful angels

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will never forget.

00:34:14.702 --> 00:34:17.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, God’s Word tells us that the angels

00:34:17.238 --> 00:34:21.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are still focused
on what Jehovah is doing on the earth,

00:34:21.209 --> 00:34:24.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially with regard to his people.

00:34:24.479 --> 00:34:28.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 1:12 says

00:34:28.015 --> 00:34:30.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “into these very things,

00:34:30.151 --> 00:34:33.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
angels are desiring to peer.”

00:34:33.788 --> 00:34:37.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So then, do the angels find pleasure

00:34:37.358 --> 00:34:40.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s gradual work and blessing?

00:34:40.128 --> 00:34:41.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they do.

00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:43.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And aren’t we grateful

00:34:43.831 --> 00:34:46.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they love Jehovah so much

00:34:46.734 --> 00:34:50.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as each one of us?

00:34:50.104 --> 00:34:55.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we learn from their response
to Jehovah’s gradual work?

00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:58.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learn to treasure every moment

00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:01.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s service and to be grateful

00:35:01.415 --> 00:35:03.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for every opportunity we have

00:35:03.918 --> 00:35:06.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn more about him.

00:35:06.454 --> 00:35:09.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So be like the angels and, in effect,

00:35:09.524 --> 00:35:11.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shout in applause

00:35:11.659 --> 00:35:15.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at each new thing you learn
about our heavenly Father.

00:35:15.096 --> 00:35:18.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take time to meditate on his works,

00:35:18.266 --> 00:35:20.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on his Word of truth,

00:35:20.268 --> 00:35:22.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and on his indescribable mercy

00:35:22.904 --> 00:35:25.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
toward us through his Son.

00:35:26.207 --> 00:35:28.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our next example,

00:35:28.209 --> 00:35:32.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we look to the future
but not too far into the future.

00:35:32.079 --> 00:35:35.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re talking about the resurrection

00:35:35.516 --> 00:35:38.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—specifically the resurrection

00:35:38.052 --> 00:35:40.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and perfection.

00:35:40.488 --> 00:35:44.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jehovah through his Son
resurrects countless millions

00:35:44.358 --> 00:35:47.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to life again in the new world,

00:35:47.328 --> 00:35:50.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will not all come back
at the same time,

00:35:50.331 --> 00:35:53.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor will they come back in perfection.

00:35:53.935 --> 00:35:57.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah
will bring them back in such a way

00:35:57.471 --> 00:35:59.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they will know themselves;

00:35:59.473 --> 00:36:01.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will recognize themselves.

00:36:01.876 --> 00:36:05.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although their serious infirmities will be gone,

00:36:05.479 --> 00:36:07.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will instantly know

00:36:07.715 --> 00:36:10.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their own familiar thoughts and feelings.

00:36:10.651 --> 00:36:13.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will know who they are as a person.

00:36:14.989 --> 00:36:18.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine the joy that such ones will have

00:36:18.726 --> 00:36:21.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they apply what they learn

00:36:21.195 --> 00:36:23.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then see the progress

00:36:23.197 --> 00:36:27.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they are making day after day
in serving Jehovah.

00:36:27.568 --> 00:36:32.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will experience the words
of Proverbs 10:22 coming true for them.

00:36:33.174 --> 00:36:37.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please follow along,
where it says in verse 22:

00:36:37.812 --> 00:36:41.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is the blessing of Jehovah
that makes one rich,

00:36:41.949 --> 00:36:45.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he adds no pain with it.”

00:36:46.721 --> 00:36:50.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what will God’s gradual blessing do

00:36:50.625 --> 00:36:53.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for such ones at that time?

00:36:53.027 --> 00:36:55.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His blessing will make them rich

00:36:55.696 --> 00:37:00.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the most important way of all
—and that is spiritually.

00:37:00.268 --> 00:37:05.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Things that they struggle
to be able to overcome

00:37:05.039 --> 00:37:07.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this old world under man’s control

00:37:07.608 --> 00:37:09.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Satan’s influence,

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:12.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will be able to overcome

00:37:12.513 --> 00:37:14.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they love Jehovah

00:37:14.649 --> 00:37:17.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will help them to do so.

00:37:17.218 --> 00:37:21.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But even more than this,
in the new world,

00:37:21.389 --> 00:37:23.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
millions and millions of people

00:37:23.824 --> 00:37:27.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will come to experience physical vitality

00:37:27.061 --> 00:37:29.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and strength that exceeds

00:37:29.063 --> 00:37:32.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
anything imaginable today.

00:37:32.867 --> 00:37:36.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s gradual blessing will take hold,

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:40.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and grateful ones will rejoice day after day.

00:37:40.207 --> 00:37:42.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also important is the fact

00:37:42.643 --> 00:37:45.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that as each person grows

00:37:45.513 --> 00:37:48.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
toward perfection,

00:37:48.049 --> 00:37:51.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will keep hold
of the empathy needed

00:37:51.485 --> 00:37:55.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach and help still others

00:37:55.022 --> 00:37:58.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will come back
in a gradual resurrection.

00:37:59.593 --> 00:38:03.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can contemplating
such future blessings benefit us?

00:38:03.931 --> 00:38:06.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
benefit you right now?

00:38:07.401 --> 00:38:12.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We benefit
when we patiently focus on Jehovah

00:38:12.406 --> 00:38:15.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how he often fulfills his promises

00:38:15.776 --> 00:38:17.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a gradual way.

00:38:17.845 --> 00:38:21.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having this in mind
keeps us grounded, you could say.

00:38:21.115 --> 00:38:24.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do our best, but we do not expect

00:38:24.685 --> 00:38:28.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everything right now, do we,

00:38:28.089 --> 00:38:30.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially perfection?

00:38:30.291 --> 00:38:32.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is yet in the future.

00:38:32.793 --> 00:38:35.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, when we develop strong faith,

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:39.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will find joy
no matter what we will yet face.

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:38:41.202 --> 00:38:43.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because we are absolutely certain

00:38:43.504 --> 00:38:47.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah’s promises
will come true, right on time.

00:38:48.376 --> 00:38:52.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we get to the part
that especially involves you.

00:38:54.115 --> 00:38:57.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As one graduating from Gilead School,

00:38:57.118 --> 00:39:01.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you may look back
on the past five months

00:39:01.222 --> 00:39:04.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and worry that you
did not do everything perfectly.

00:39:04.925 --> 00:39:06.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know that’s how I would feel,

00:39:06.927 --> 00:39:09.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but please don’t focus on that.

00:39:09.797 --> 00:39:13.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, imagine the joy that you will find

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:17.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you patiently apply
the things that you have learned

00:39:17.772 --> 00:39:22.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then you see
Jehovah’s gradual blessing on your efforts.

00:39:22.777 --> 00:39:25.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, a head full of knowledge

00:39:25.946 --> 00:39:29.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not what brings Jehovah’s blessing.

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:34.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What matters
is what we do with what we know.

00:39:34.021 --> 00:39:36.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider the example of King Solomon.

00:39:36.624 --> 00:39:41.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Kings 4:32 says

00:39:41.095 --> 00:39:43.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ‘he composed 3,000 proverbs

00:39:43.998 --> 00:39:47.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 1,005 songs.’

00:39:47.568 --> 00:39:49.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there was a disconnect

00:39:49.804 --> 00:39:51.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between what was in his mind

00:39:51.806 --> 00:39:55.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what was
really driving him from the heart.

00:39:55.709 --> 00:39:57.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as a result,

00:39:57.711 --> 00:40:00.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Solomon drifted
away from Jehovah, didn’t he?

00:40:00.881 --> 00:40:03.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible tells us that his foreign wives

00:40:03.451 --> 00:40:06.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gradually inclined his heart

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:08.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
away from Jehovah.

00:40:08.622 --> 00:40:12.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you could say that he, in effect,
substituted one gradual thing

00:40:12.693 --> 00:40:15.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for another gradual thing.

00:40:15.196 --> 00:40:17.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In turn, he lost the opportunity

00:40:17.598 --> 00:40:21.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find joy in Jehovah’s gradual blessing.

00:40:22.703 --> 00:40:25.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in contrast to that example,

00:40:25.106 --> 00:40:29.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make it your heart’s desire
to be like the faithful angels.

00:40:29.743 --> 00:40:32.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although they undoubtedly know

00:40:32.513 --> 00:40:36.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
far more than 3,000 proverbs and songs,

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:40.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they savor every morsel that they learn

00:40:40.855 --> 00:40:44.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about our magnificent heavenly Father.

00:40:44.258 --> 00:40:46.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And again, as you look to the future

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to the real life—

00:40:48.762 --> 00:40:52.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take what you have learned
in this beautiful schooling

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:56.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and humbly work for the interests of others.

00:40:56.203 --> 00:40:59.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will bless that effort,
and the gradual blessing

00:40:59.673 --> 00:41:03.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you will enjoy will serve as a taste

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:06.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what is yet ahead in God’s new world.

00:41:06.881 --> 00:41:11.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep in mind that those who find joy now

00:41:11.752 --> 00:41:14.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a gradual blessing

00:41:14.088 --> 00:41:18.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will have no problem
in patiently waiting for

00:41:18.225 --> 00:41:22.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then enjoying
the gradual blessings that are still to come.

00:41:33.807 --> 00:41:35.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much, Brother Cook.

00:41:35.809 --> 00:41:39.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We truly appreciated those fine comments.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:42.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just had a brief note here:

00:41:42.316 --> 00:41:45.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Expect the unexpected gradually.”

00:41:47.054 --> 00:41:49.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’m sure we all got that point,

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:53.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll enjoy looking forward
to seeing that program, or that talk,

00:41:53.827 --> 00:41:56.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
again and going through the main points.

00:41:56.297 --> 00:41:58.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, for you students,

00:41:58.299 --> 00:42:02.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re about to be addressed
by one of your instructors from Gilead.

00:42:02.136 --> 00:42:04.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve heard
from Brother Cauthon a number of times,

00:42:04.772 --> 00:42:07.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now he’s going
to address you this final time

00:42:07.975 --> 00:42:10.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on this intriguing theme

00:42:10.744 --> 00:42:14.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Shoulder to Shoulder.”

00:42:16.517 --> 00:42:19.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the spring of 1945,

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:23.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Allied and Russian armies
were converging upon Germany.

00:42:23.557 --> 00:42:25.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Nazis were losing the war.

00:42:26.293 --> 00:42:28.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Germans gave the ominous order:

00:42:28.629 --> 00:42:31.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
March all the concentration camp prisoners west,

00:42:31.765 --> 00:42:33.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and destroy all the evidence of the horrors

00:42:33.968 --> 00:42:36.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that had taken place in those camps.

00:42:37.238 --> 00:42:42.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the 20th of April,
the evacuation of Sachsenhausen began.

00:42:42.243 --> 00:42:46.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The plan was to march
the prisoners to the Baltic Coast,

00:42:46.714 --> 00:42:50.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ship them out to sea, and drown them.

00:42:51.785 --> 00:42:53.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if that wasn’t horrific enough,

00:42:53.954 --> 00:42:57.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the SS guards had explicit orders

00:42:57.024 --> 00:43:01.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to shoot any of the prisoners
who couldn’t keep up.

00:43:01.228 --> 00:43:03.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Already in a weakened state,

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:07.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hundreds were shot along the way,

00:43:07.167 --> 00:43:12.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while many thousands more died
of exposure, starvation, and exhaustion.

00:43:12.172 --> 00:43:17.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thus began what came to be known
as a death march.

00:43:19.747 --> 00:43:23.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly,
the Sachsenhausen evacuation

00:43:23.684 --> 00:43:26.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
included 230 of our brothers.

00:43:26.453 --> 00:43:28.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just like the other prisoners,

00:43:28.489 --> 00:43:30.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were in no shape

00:43:30.557 --> 00:43:34.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make this journey physically,

00:43:34.662 --> 00:43:39.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they were 
more than up to the journey spiritually.

00:43:39.133 --> 00:43:40.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?

00:43:40.868 --> 00:43:44.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, open your Bibles, if you would,
to a promise Jehovah made.

00:43:44.838 --> 00:43:48.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s found at Zephaniah 3:9.

00:43:48.542 --> 00:43:51.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here,
he promised to give to his people

00:43:51.779 --> 00:43:53.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a pure language.

00:43:53.814 --> 00:43:57.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the point being
so that they could do what?

00:43:57.685 --> 00:43:59.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The latter part of that verse says

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:02.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to serve him shoulder to shoulder”

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:06.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or, as the footnote says, “in unity.”

00:44:06.894 --> 00:44:09.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was the key.

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:11.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The secret weapon

00:44:11.632 --> 00:44:15.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was their shoulder-to-shoulder unity.

00:44:16.036 --> 00:44:20.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even the weak become strong
when they are united.

00:44:20.774 --> 00:44:25.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, today,
you and I are on a march for life.

00:44:25.479 --> 00:44:28.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And never forget
that we’re not marching alone.

00:44:28.682 --> 00:44:32.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have our brothers and sisters
from all backgrounds and all ages

00:44:32.686 --> 00:44:34.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with us for the journey.

00:44:34.822 --> 00:44:36.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the question is,

00:44:36.824 --> 00:44:40.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we marching shoulder to shoulder?

00:44:40.894 --> 00:44:45.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we learn from our brothers
who went through this death march?

00:44:45.899 --> 00:44:48.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, first of all,

00:44:48.135 --> 00:44:51.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach the coast,
the Sachsenhausen prisoners

00:44:51.171 --> 00:44:54.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were to march 155 miles

00:44:54.508 --> 00:44:57.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s 250 kilometers.

00:44:57.177 --> 00:45:00.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And throughout that journey,
the Witnesses pooled all their food supplies

00:45:00.881 --> 00:45:05.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into one small bundle
that was used for the benefit of all.

00:45:05.018 --> 00:45:09.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you can imagine
that sharing food is not an easy thing to do

00:45:09.456 --> 00:45:13.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you’ve already been starved
and you’re very weak.

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:17.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But our brothers knew Bible principles,

00:45:17.197 --> 00:45:20.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as the one at Proverbs 11:25 that says:

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:22.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The generous person will prosper,

00:45:22.436 --> 00:45:27.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and whoever refreshes others
will himself be refreshed.”

00:45:27.007 --> 00:45:30.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the lesson for us today?

00:45:30.577 --> 00:45:32.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The lesson is this:

00:45:32.679 --> 00:45:37.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unity to be real
must withstand the severest test.

00:45:38.352 --> 00:45:42.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being a true Christian
is more than a commitment to God;

00:45:42.122 --> 00:45:45.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is a commitment to other Christians as well.

00:45:45.759 --> 00:45:48.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So don’t hold back.

00:45:48.429 --> 00:45:51.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Show a generous disposition
in your assignment.

00:45:51.932 --> 00:45:55.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And remember,
one of the most important resources

00:45:55.169 --> 00:45:58.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you can share with others is your time.

00:45:58.605 --> 00:46:00.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So learn the balance.

00:46:00.874 --> 00:46:04.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take time with others who may need it,

00:46:04.011 --> 00:46:06.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and don’t be ruled by time.

00:46:06.146 --> 00:46:09.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather than rush, refresh.

00:46:11.919 --> 00:46:13.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second point:

00:46:13.921 --> 00:46:17.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the SS guards
gave the Witnesses a cart to haul,

00:46:17.191 --> 00:46:21.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that easily could have seemed
like just another burden to bear,

00:46:21.495 --> 00:46:23.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but instead our brothers were thrilled.

00:46:23.831 --> 00:46:25.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:46:25.833 --> 00:46:28.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because they saw it as an opportunity.

00:46:28.135 --> 00:46:30.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?

00:46:30.137 --> 00:46:32.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, during the journey,
the sick and elderly ones

00:46:32.673 --> 00:46:35.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were able to sit 
on top of the cart and rest for a while,

00:46:35.909 --> 00:46:38.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then when one 
would get his strength back,

00:46:38.745 --> 00:46:40.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
another one would replace him.

00:46:40.981 --> 00:46:45.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so in a very real way,
they carried one another.

00:46:46.587 --> 00:46:49.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The lesson for us?

00:46:49.423 --> 00:46:53.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where there is unity, there is victory.

00:46:53.227 --> 00:46:57.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the middle of difficulty, lies opportunity.

00:46:57.431 --> 00:47:02.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So look for opportunities
to encourage one another.

00:47:02.436 --> 00:47:07.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The word “encourage” literally means
“to make strong or to hearten.”

00:47:07.207 --> 00:47:11.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being spiritual people,
we may not lose our hope

00:47:11.011 --> 00:47:13.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we could lose heart,

00:47:13.013 --> 00:47:16.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially during times
of extreme crisis or grief.

00:47:16.884 --> 00:47:19.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But something
as simple as a reassuring word

00:47:19.786 --> 00:47:23.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even a kind deed
can work like a miracle.

00:47:23.991 --> 00:47:26.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can restore the weary soul.

00:47:26.093 --> 00:47:29.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can carry others through a hard time.

00:47:29.062 --> 00:47:31.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the point is this:

00:47:31.398 --> 00:47:36.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re not responsible
for everyone in the Christian congregation,

00:47:36.036 --> 00:47:39.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you are responsible to them.

00:47:39.239 --> 00:47:43.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah expects us to do
whatever we can to help our brothers.

00:47:43.644 --> 00:47:45.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We simply cannot allow ourselves

00:47:45.913 --> 00:47:48.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be separated in interest

00:47:48.181 --> 00:47:51.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or divided in purpose.

00:47:51.184 --> 00:47:53.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then one more point:

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:58.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On their last night,
the prisoners were stopped near a forest.

00:47:58.125 --> 00:48:02.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The SS guards encouraged
everyone to walk across to freedom.

00:48:02.863 --> 00:48:04.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine you were there.

00:48:04.932 --> 00:48:08.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It must have seemed very tempting.

00:48:08.368 --> 00:48:10.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But naturally,
they were unsure of what to do,

00:48:10.771 --> 00:48:13.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they prayed for guidance

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:17.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and unitedly they decided to stay put

00:48:17.377 --> 00:48:20.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not one of them left the group.

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:23.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, it was learned that those
who had accepted the offer

00:48:23.417 --> 00:48:25.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were shot down.

00:48:25.485 --> 00:48:27.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The lesson for us?

00:48:27.487 --> 00:48:31.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t allow anything
or anyone to cause division.

00:48:32.693 --> 00:48:36.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan is the master of divide and conquer.

00:48:36.363 --> 00:48:41.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must stand together until forever.

00:48:42.603 --> 00:48:44.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When problems arise,

00:48:44.905 --> 00:48:47.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can use your energy

00:48:47.574 --> 00:48:51.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for retaliation or resolution, but not both.

00:48:51.311 --> 00:48:54.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible says:
“Have intense love for one another.”

00:48:54.047 --> 00:48:57.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So don’t allow differences
to develop into distance,

00:48:57.918 --> 00:49:01.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and don’t nurture past offenses.

00:49:01.622 --> 00:49:06.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brotherhood is a place
where mistakes are not rubbed in

00:49:06.059 --> 00:49:08.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but rubbed out.

00:49:11.465 --> 00:49:13.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To recap:

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:16.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We serve God in part, brothers,

00:49:16.303 --> 00:49:18.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by serving others.

00:49:18.505 --> 00:49:21.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Willingly share
your resources with one another,

00:49:21.575 --> 00:49:23.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially your time.

00:49:23.744 --> 00:49:26.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s in times
of deep crisis and grief and doubt

00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:29.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we need each other the most.

00:49:29.316 --> 00:49:31.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you see
a brother’s or a sister’s shoulders

00:49:31.918 --> 00:49:34.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beginning to droop,

00:49:34.287 --> 00:49:36.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pull out your “cart” for them.

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:40.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do what is needed
even if it’s difficult or inconvenient.

00:49:40.694 --> 00:49:44.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, our actions
reveal what’s in our heart,

00:49:44.531 --> 00:49:46.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether we like it or not.

00:49:46.533 --> 00:49:51.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have intense love for one another;

00:49:51.371 --> 00:49:54.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remain united in heart and mind;

00:49:54.675 --> 00:49:57.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
continue committed to one another

00:49:57.177 --> 00:50:00.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you are to Jehovah God and Jesus Christ.

00:50:00.313 --> 00:50:02.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally,

00:50:02.315 --> 00:50:06.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is beauty and power in unity.

00:50:06.053 --> 00:50:10.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is creating a new world,
brothers and sisters, a new world.

00:50:10.891 --> 00:50:13.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One world, one people

00:50:13.393 --> 00:50:17.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a new world society of unified worshippers.

00:50:17.264 --> 00:50:19.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay focused on that fact.

00:50:22.202 --> 00:50:24.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In conclusion,

00:50:24.571 --> 00:50:27.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over 10,700 lost their lives

00:50:27.841 --> 00:50:30.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on that infamous death march
from Sachsenhausen,

00:50:30.711 --> 00:50:32.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but not one,

00:50:32.713 --> 00:50:36.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not one of our 230 brothers lost their life.

00:50:36.149 --> 00:50:38.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:50:38.151 --> 00:50:41.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s let them
tell us in their own words.

00:50:41.121 --> 00:50:43.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s a quotation from a resolution

00:50:43.356 --> 00:50:46.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made by our brothers in that forest

00:50:46.793 --> 00:50:48.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just before their freedom.

00:50:48.895 --> 00:50:50.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I quote:

00:50:50.697 --> 00:50:54.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘A long, hard time of trial is behind us

00:50:54.201 --> 00:50:57.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and we have been brought forth
from the fiery furnace

00:50:57.204 --> 00:51:00.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘without a scent of the fire upon us.

00:51:00.073 --> 00:51:02.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘On the contrary,

00:51:02.075 --> 00:51:05.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘we are full of power and strength in Jehovah.

00:51:05.612 --> 00:51:08.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘We have only one desire

00:51:08.615 --> 00:51:11.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘after our stay in the “lions’ den.”

00:51:11.618 --> 00:51:14.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘We will serve Jehovah throughout eternity.

00:51:14.621 --> 00:51:19.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This would be our most precious reward.’

00:51:19.059 --> 00:51:20.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s signed:

00:51:21.528 --> 00:51:24.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“YOUR CO-FIGHTERS 
FOR JEHOVAH’S HOLY NAME.”

00:51:24.264 --> 00:51:26.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, they didn’t pretend to be brothers;

00:51:26.533 --> 00:51:28.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were brothers.

00:51:28.535 --> 00:51:32.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They functioned as one united family
throughout the whole ordeal,

00:51:32.439 --> 00:51:34.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were victorious.

00:51:34.608 --> 00:51:39.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so, as this world
grows colder and colder, brothers,

00:51:39.045 --> 00:51:42.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let us be more determined than ever

00:51:42.449 --> 00:51:47.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve our God shoulder to shoulder.

00:52:06.006 --> 00:52:09.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, thank you so much, Brother Cauthon.

00:52:09.142 --> 00:52:12.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were so many excellent points in that talk.

00:52:12.579 --> 00:52:15.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did I write down to remind me?

00:52:15.649 --> 00:52:17.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Shoulder to shoulder.”

00:52:18.652 --> 00:52:20.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did also write down, though:

00:52:20.654 --> 00:52:23.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Imperfections—don’t rub in, rub out.”

00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:26.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there are a lot of good points

00:52:26.126 --> 00:52:28.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you dear students,
soon-to-be graduates,

00:52:28.795 --> 00:52:31.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are taking down, I’m sure.

00:52:31.164 --> 00:52:33.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now you’re going to listen

00:52:33.266 --> 00:52:36.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to another brother who’s very familiar to you

00:52:36.169 --> 00:52:38.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one of your instructors.

00:52:38.171 --> 00:52:40.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the difference is that this time

00:52:40.473 --> 00:52:45.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re not going to be looking at him
and thinking of written exercises.

00:52:46.646 --> 00:52:48.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you’re going to be thinking,

00:52:48.748 --> 00:52:51.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, I can sit back and enjoy these comments.’

00:52:51.852 --> 00:52:56.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Mark Noumair,
a helper to the Teaching Committee

00:52:56.289 --> 00:52:58.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as an instructor of Gilead,

00:52:58.658 --> 00:53:00.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now talk to you on the theme

00:53:00.794 --> 00:53:03.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Four Words to Live By.”

00:53:05.265 --> 00:53:09.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can there really be four words
that you can base your life on?

00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:13.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if so, what would they be?

00:53:13.173 --> 00:53:16.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we look
to our Exemplar, Christ Jesus, for the answer.

00:53:16.643 --> 00:53:19.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We focus on the night before his death.

00:53:19.846 --> 00:53:24.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The future of every human being
rested upon his shoulders.

00:53:24.718 --> 00:53:29.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His words, his actions,
his very thoughts in these critical moments

00:53:29.389 --> 00:53:32.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be remembered for thousands of years.

00:53:32.792 --> 00:53:36.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would he give the world to remember?

00:53:36.830 --> 00:53:40.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He left no room for guesswork.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In one verse, one verse,

00:53:42.736 --> 00:53:47.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus reveals what governed
his every action and his decision

00:53:47.274 --> 00:53:49.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in one verse.

00:53:49.376 --> 00:53:54.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Four words
—four words that he lived by—

00:53:54.381 --> 00:53:58.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we encourage you
to live by these four words.

00:53:58.518 --> 00:54:02.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We encourage you
to take these four words to heart.

00:54:02.555 --> 00:54:04.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take them seriously.

00:54:04.858 --> 00:54:09.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re found at John 14:31,

00:54:11.398 --> 00:54:13.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John 14:31,

00:54:13.633 --> 00:54:17.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the last night of Jesus life:

00:54:17.003 --> 00:54:22.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But for the world to know
that I love the Father.”

00:54:22.008 --> 00:54:24.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I love the Father.”

00:54:24.311 --> 00:54:26.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In these four words,

00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:31.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we find the most powerful bond in the universe

00:54:31.284 --> 00:54:36.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—an unbreakable bond of love
between Jesus and his Father.

00:54:36.289 --> 00:54:40.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it is this unbreakable attachment

00:54:40.093 --> 00:54:43.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that enabled Jesus to unselfishly defend

00:54:43.296 --> 00:54:47.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his Father’s reputation to his dying breath,

00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:51.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trusting that Jehovah
would protect and resurrect him.

00:54:52.906 --> 00:54:55.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I love the Father.”

00:54:55.575 --> 00:54:58.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how did this love develop?

00:54:58.111 --> 00:55:03.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did this unbreakable bond,
this attachment of love, develop?

00:55:03.116 --> 00:55:05.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the only-begotten Son was created perfect.

00:55:05.685 --> 00:55:06.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True.

00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:11.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, was he created
with love already fully developed?

00:55:11.825 --> 00:55:13.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:55:13.393 --> 00:55:15.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was created with free will;

00:55:15.562 --> 00:55:18.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan was created with free will

00:55:18.398 --> 00:55:22.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with the capacity to extend,
enlarge, and enrich this love.

00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:25.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Son of God

00:55:25.572 --> 00:55:29.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was not created
with an unselfish, self-sacrificing love

00:55:29.809 --> 00:55:32.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
already fully in place.

00:55:32.078 --> 00:55:34.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did he have to do?

00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:37.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had to cultivate
this deep attachment for his Father,

00:55:37.951 --> 00:55:39.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cultivate this deep love.

00:55:39.953 --> 00:55:42.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did he do that?

00:55:42.188 --> 00:55:46.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By observing his Father’s personality.

00:55:46.993 --> 00:55:51.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In his prehuman existence,
imagine how the Son would do this.

00:55:51.064 --> 00:55:55.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He would observe closely
how his Father used his power,

00:55:55.201 --> 00:55:58.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how he used his authority,
how he used his strength

00:55:58.405 --> 00:56:00.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in behalf of people

00:56:00.407 --> 00:56:04.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—‘those crushed, those lowly in spirit.’

00:56:04.978 --> 00:56:08.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He would observe
how his Father used his power

00:56:08.515 --> 00:56:11.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help those “crushed in spirit.”

00:56:11.317 --> 00:56:14.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He watched his Father 
deal with Ruth the Moabite girl

00:56:14.821 --> 00:56:18.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a Moabite girl from a pagan nation.

00:56:18.625 --> 00:56:21.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Might he have thought: ‘Now, a Moabite girl?

00:56:21.561 --> 00:56:23.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Weren’t these the Moabite women—?

00:56:23.563 --> 00:56:28.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Weren’t these the very women
that lured the Israelite men into immorality

00:56:28.201 --> 00:56:31.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right on the threshold of the Promised Land?’

00:56:31.004 --> 00:56:32.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True.

00:56:32.672 --> 00:56:35.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But his Father saw that this girl was different.

00:56:35.308 --> 00:56:36.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was different.

00:56:36.643 --> 00:56:39.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a lesson for the Son of God!

00:56:39.746 --> 00:56:42.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His Father did not put people in categories;

00:56:42.949 --> 00:56:45.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he did not stereotype individuals.

00:56:45.785 --> 00:56:49.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Oh, that’s the Moabite girl.
I’m not going to deal with her.’

00:56:49.289 --> 00:56:50.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:56:50.957 --> 00:56:54.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah God looked at Ruth as an individual.

00:56:54.727 --> 00:56:58.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Son’s love must have grown 
as now He allows this girl—

00:56:58.498 --> 00:57:01.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He allows a Bible book
to be named in behalf of her

00:57:01.868 --> 00:57:04.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Ruth as opposed to Naomi or Boaz—

00:57:04.671 --> 00:57:06.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ruth, a Moabite girl.

00:57:06.673 --> 00:57:08.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right.

00:57:08.675 --> 00:57:11.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Son’s love would’ve continued to grow

00:57:11.578 --> 00:57:15.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he observed
how his Father then allowed this girl

00:57:15.148 --> 00:57:18.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to become an ancestress to the Messiah.

00:57:19.619 --> 00:57:23.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But watching and admiring
his Father wasn’t enough.

00:57:23.623 --> 00:57:25.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He went further.

00:57:25.625 --> 00:57:29.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the Son continued to develop appreciation

00:57:29.162 --> 00:57:31.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for his Father’s qualities,

00:57:31.164 --> 00:57:35.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this bond of love
became more than just a feeling.

00:57:35.001 --> 00:57:36.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:57:36.002 --> 00:57:40.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His love for his Father
began to shape his decisions and actions,

00:57:40.273 --> 00:57:43.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jesus demonstrated this
when he was on earth.

00:57:43.676 --> 00:57:47.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t just say the words,
“I love the Father.”

00:57:47.447 --> 00:57:49.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t just feel the words

00:57:49.516 --> 00:57:52.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—feel “I love the Father’s cozy, warm, little feeling.”

00:57:52.719 --> 00:57:54.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, no, no.

00:57:54.387 --> 00:57:57.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He lived those words,

00:57:57.690 --> 00:58:02.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that is why Jesus could say
in the second half of John 14:31:

00:58:04.531 --> 00:58:09.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am doing just as the Father
has commanded me to do.”

00:58:09.536 --> 00:58:11.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am doing”

00:58:11.538 --> 00:58:14.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—you see, his entire life course

00:58:14.908 --> 00:58:18.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
proved that he loved the Father.

00:58:20.046 --> 00:58:22.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:58:22.048 --> 00:58:24.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when a Syrophoenician woman

00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:27.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
begged Jesus
to cure her demonized daughter,

00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:29.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
initially Jesus said:

00:58:29.122 --> 00:58:33.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘No, 
I was sent forth not to the Gentiles

00:58:33.059 --> 00:58:35.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but to the Jews.’

00:58:35.562 --> 00:58:37.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the woman would not give up,

00:58:37.564 --> 00:58:41.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and showing her faith,
she kept asking and asking.

00:58:41.734 --> 00:58:46.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in light of this exceptional circumstance,

00:58:46.739 --> 00:58:50.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus could see that this was no time

00:58:50.176 --> 00:58:55.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to enforce a general rule
or to stereotype people

00:58:55.181 --> 00:58:58.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to become inflexible
or to put her in a category.

00:58:58.451 --> 00:59:02.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Oh, no. You’re a Gentile.
You’re Syrophoenician. No, no.’

00:59:02.021 --> 00:59:06.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, Jesus saw this was a time to bend

00:59:06.559 --> 00:59:10.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in response to higher principles.

00:59:10.530 --> 00:59:12.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he remember

00:59:12.532 --> 00:59:16.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how his Father handled that situation with Ruth?

00:59:16.202 --> 00:59:19.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this moved him to say:
‘My Father did that with Ruth.

00:59:19.606 --> 00:59:21.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Now we have a similar situation.

00:59:21.774 --> 00:59:24.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would my Father want me to do?’

00:59:24.711 --> 00:59:28.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus helped the Syrophoenician woman.

00:59:28.348 --> 00:59:32.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was ready to act
in imitation of his Father’s love.

00:59:34.287 --> 00:59:37.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another example 
would be what Jesus learned

00:59:37.724 --> 00:59:40.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from his Father about forgiveness.

00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:44.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He watched his Father forgive
—forgive people.

00:59:44.464 --> 00:59:47.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He watched his Father
forgive David for adultery,

00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:50.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
forgive David for the murder of Uriah.

00:59:50.403 --> 00:59:53.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How many others
did the Son of God watch?

00:59:53.306 --> 00:59:56.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How many others
did he watch his Father forgive?

00:59:56.709 --> 01:00:00.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Hebrew Scriptures
are replete with Jehovah forgiving people.

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s a largehearted Forgiver.

01:00:02.715 --> 01:00:04.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s ready to forgive.

01:00:04.284 --> 01:00:06.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s on the lookout to forgive.

01:00:06.619 --> 01:00:09.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what the Son of God learned.

01:00:10.890 --> 01:00:14.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this no doubt helped him
to deal with the frequency

01:00:14.961 --> 01:00:19.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the imperfections
of the apostles and others.

01:00:19.465 --> 01:00:22.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus viewed forgiving others

01:00:22.902 --> 01:00:27.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as an opportunity to imitate his Father

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:31.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—another opportunity to allow his actions

01:00:31.611 --> 01:00:34.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to declare loud and clear

01:00:34.347 --> 01:00:37.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“like Father, like Son.”

01:00:37.984 --> 01:00:41.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t just say, “I love the Father.”

01:00:41.287 --> 01:00:44.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t just feel it; he lived it.

01:00:45.858 --> 01:00:50.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we take this discussion out of the classroom

01:00:50.129 --> 01:00:54.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and apply it to your real-life situations.

01:00:54.801 --> 01:00:57.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right after Jesus said,

01:00:57.070 --> 01:00:59.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I love the Father,”

01:00:59.172 --> 01:01:04.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said,
“Get up, let us go from here.”

01:01:04.977 --> 01:01:07.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, soon you’re going to get up

01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:10.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’re going to go from here,

01:01:10.817 --> 01:01:14.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you don’t know what tests of faith
are going to come upon you.

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:16.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t know.

01:01:16.222 --> 01:01:20.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can’t anticipate every test
that’s going to come upon us of faith.

01:01:20.993 --> 01:01:22.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However,

01:01:22.995 --> 01:01:26.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you know these four words,

01:01:26.232 --> 01:01:28.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know enough.

01:01:29.335 --> 01:01:32.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Etch these four words
“I love the Father”

01:01:32.739 --> 01:01:35.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on your minds and on your hearts.

01:01:35.708 --> 01:01:40.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let these four words govern
every decision and action of yours.

01:01:41.414 --> 01:01:43.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

01:01:43.449 --> 01:01:46.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you’re entrusted with authority,

01:01:46.786 --> 01:01:48.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how will you treat people?

01:01:48.888 --> 01:01:51.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How will you treat those under you?

01:01:51.924 --> 01:01:56.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Learn from Jesus on this last night.

01:01:56.629 --> 01:02:00.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His words could’ve been all about himself.

01:02:00.333 --> 01:02:02.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘For the world to know

01:02:02.835 --> 01:02:07.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘that I am the Son of God,

01:02:07.006 --> 01:02:09.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘“the firstborn of all creation.”

01:02:09.008 --> 01:02:12.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m the second greatest personage in the universe.’

01:02:12.211 --> 01:02:14.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or he could’ve said,

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:18.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I plan to surrender my life for you

01:02:18.151 --> 01:02:22.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the ransom sacrifice for you.’

01:02:22.422 --> 01:02:27.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or, ‘I am the one
—I’m the one who fulfills all prophecy.’

01:02:27.427 --> 01:02:30.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But none of his thoughts were about himself,

01:02:30.997 --> 01:02:34.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his authority, or his accomplishments.

01:02:34.534 --> 01:02:39.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So like Jesus, don’t focus on your position.

01:02:39.405 --> 01:02:41.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Show by your dealings with others

01:02:41.574 --> 01:02:44.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that your heartfelt desire and motives

01:02:44.310 --> 01:02:46.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are to please your heavenly Father.

01:02:46.412 --> 01:02:48.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what you want to do.

01:02:49.916 --> 01:02:54.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as you go from here,

01:02:54.921 --> 01:02:58.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will be your “Ruth”?

01:02:59.559 --> 01:03:03.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Show that you don’t put people in categories.

01:03:03.729 --> 01:03:05.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Show it.

01:03:05.731 --> 01:03:08.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of that department,

01:03:08.067 --> 01:03:11.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that nationality, that language group,

01:03:11.804 --> 01:03:15.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or those sisters,

01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:19.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will be your “Syrophoenician woman”?

01:03:19.979 --> 01:03:24.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seize opportunities to be
more flexible and reasonable.

01:03:24.984 --> 01:03:29.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Discern when it will be a time to bend

01:03:29.355 --> 01:03:33.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in response to higher principles

01:03:33.526 --> 01:03:37.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than always being
on the lookout to check and correct.

01:03:38.364 --> 01:03:42.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Work hard to acquire thinking ability

01:03:42.401 --> 01:03:44.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—thinking ability that will assist you

01:03:44.871 --> 01:03:48.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to respond to higher principles.

01:03:49.942 --> 01:03:53.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Developing thinking ability is not easy

01:03:53.279 --> 01:03:56.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because as you begin to think about a person,

01:03:56.115 --> 01:03:58.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
often your emotional reactions

01:03:58.417 --> 01:04:02.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
toward that person start interfering.

01:04:02.421 --> 01:04:04.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You begin registering likes, dislikes,

01:04:04.924 --> 01:04:06.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
respect, disrespect,

01:04:06.926 --> 01:04:08.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trust, distrust

01:04:08.961 --> 01:04:13.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—reacting emotionally
before beginning an intellectual appraisal.

01:04:15.468 --> 01:04:19.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you make decisions
solely based on feelings

01:04:19.705 --> 01:04:23.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have slipped in
under the guise of thoughts,

01:04:23.376 --> 01:04:26.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this often leads to poor decisions.

01:04:28.247 --> 01:04:32.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So listen
to what I’m going to tell you right now.

01:04:33.986 --> 01:04:36.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ask yourself,

01:04:36.489 --> 01:04:40.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Will my decision-making process

01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:44.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘—will it be in response to higher principles

01:04:44.664 --> 01:04:49.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or simply because I do or don’t like the person?’

01:04:49.669 --> 01:04:52.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it’s a response to higher principles,

01:04:52.204 --> 01:04:57.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now you’re strengthening
and stabilizing the organization.

01:04:58.744 --> 01:05:03.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who will be
your imperfect, disappointing “apostles”?

01:05:03.749 --> 01:05:07.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be on the lookout
for opportunities to be more forgiving,

01:05:07.653 --> 01:05:10.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more patient with the shortcomings of others.

01:05:10.756 --> 01:05:12.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you’re an overseer

01:05:12.758 --> 01:05:15.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your imperfect, disappointing “apostles”

01:05:15.962 --> 01:05:19.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be those working under you.

01:05:19.098 --> 01:05:23.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For others, it might be a fellow translator

01:05:23.202 --> 01:05:27.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a workmate in your department
that disappoints you.

01:05:27.206 --> 01:05:29.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If this happens,

01:05:29.208 --> 01:05:34.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will these four words govern your thinking?

01:05:34.013 --> 01:05:36.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They did for one sister.

01:05:36.816 --> 01:05:39.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what she says:

01:05:39.452 --> 01:05:43.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Something that happened 
in my department hurt me deeply,

01:05:43.389 --> 01:05:46.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and it shook me to my very core.

01:05:46.425 --> 01:05:50.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And since then, I struggle
with constant feelings of inadequacy.

01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:53.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I felt completely discouraged and dried up.

01:05:53.866 --> 01:05:56.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“However, I’m not a quitter.

01:05:56.702 --> 01:06:00.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will cling to Jehovah and not let go.

01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:03.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I love Jehovah above everything,

01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:06.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I’m sure 
that I will overcome my negative feelings

01:06:06.212 --> 01:06:10.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and will become 
stronger spiritually and mentally.”

01:06:11.283 --> 01:06:14.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She didn’t just say the words

01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:16.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I love the Father”;

01:06:16.088 --> 01:06:18.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she lived those words

01:06:18.557 --> 01:06:22.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—four words
that gave her a proper perspective

01:06:22.595 --> 01:06:24.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and balance in life.

01:06:26.332 --> 01:06:30.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it comes down to this:

01:06:30.436 --> 01:06:35.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you cherish Jehovah’s approval

01:06:35.441 --> 01:06:40.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your unbreakable bond of love for him

01:06:40.046 --> 01:06:44.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this spiritual relationship overrides,

01:06:44.050 --> 01:06:48.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or supersedes, our human sphere of activity,

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:50.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not much else matters.

01:06:51.657 --> 01:06:55.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you reach that point?

01:06:55.161 --> 01:06:59.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By thinking deeply
on Jehovah’s way of doing things,

01:06:59.065 --> 01:07:01.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then loving those ways,

01:07:01.567 --> 01:07:05.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then imitating your heavenly Father.

01:07:06.672 --> 01:07:11.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At John 13:15, Jesus said:

01:07:11.677 --> 01:07:15.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I set the pattern for you.”

01:07:15.748 --> 01:07:20.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s a pattern
that we are confident that you will follow.

01:07:20.619 --> 01:07:22.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Jesus, show the world.

01:07:22.988 --> 01:07:26.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s your opportunity now to show the world

01:07:26.358 --> 01:07:28.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you too can meet any challenge

01:07:28.427 --> 01:07:30.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and test of faith that comes your way.

01:07:30.930 --> 01:07:34.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know you can do it;
we have confidence in you.

01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:37.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do we know you can do it?

01:07:37.103 --> 01:07:39.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because you are clothed

01:07:39.238 --> 01:07:43.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the most unbreakable bond in the universe

01:07:43.709 --> 01:07:48.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and empowered
by the unfailing four words to live by,

01:07:48.714 --> 01:07:52.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I love the Father.”

01:08:07.566 --> 01:08:11.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, even though you
were able to listen to Brother Noumair

01:08:11.303 --> 01:08:14.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not have a written exercise afterward,

01:08:14.273 --> 01:08:17.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure, like me,
you wrote down those four words:

01:08:17.943 --> 01:08:20.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I love the Father.”

01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:22.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much, Brother Noumair.

01:08:22.348 --> 01:08:24.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really appreciated that.

01:08:24.183 --> 01:08:28.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And truly, there’s been
an abundance of good points

01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:30.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ve learned
from the program so far.

01:08:30.723 --> 01:08:33.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, all of a sudden, I realized

01:08:33.492 --> 01:08:36.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this program is going to be broadcast

01:08:36.095 --> 01:08:40.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on JW Broadcasting in 163 languages,

01:08:40.232 --> 01:08:43.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I don’t have to take notes after all.

01:08:44.703 --> 01:08:47.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an exciting and upbuilding program!

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And don’t forget to tune in later this month

01:08:49.975 --> 01:08:52.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Parts 2 and 3 of this special event.

01:08:53.412 --> 01:08:57.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To conclude,
we’d like to share greetings from Taiwan.

01:08:57.716 --> 01:09:00.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Taiwan is a Southeast Asian island

01:09:00.886 --> 01:09:03.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over 35,000 square kilometers,

01:09:03.455 --> 01:09:06.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or nearly 13,000 square miles, in size.

01:09:07.993 --> 01:09:11.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s densely populated
with over 23 million inhabitants.

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:15.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first Westerner who saw this island

01:09:15.534 --> 01:09:19.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
named it Ilha Formosa, or “Island Beautiful.”

01:09:19.538 --> 01:09:21.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s not hard to see why.

01:09:21.941 --> 01:09:26.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Taiwan has a beautiful coastline, fertile land,

01:09:26.111 --> 01:09:30.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and majestic mountains
covered in thick, luxuriant forests.

01:09:30.382 --> 01:09:34.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The majority of the population
live on the narrow coastal plains,

01:09:34.286 --> 01:09:36.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where you’ll find large bustling cities.

01:09:38.190 --> 01:09:42.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Manufacturing and exporting various goods
drives the economy in Taiwan.

01:09:43.395 --> 01:09:46.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The official language of Taiwan
is Mandarin Chinese.

01:09:46.432 --> 01:09:50.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, there are
also 16 recognized indigenous language groups.

01:09:51.804 --> 01:09:56.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the languages
that our brothers reach out to is Amis.

01:09:56.175 --> 01:09:58.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In January 2018,

01:09:58.210 --> 01:10:03.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Amis remote translation office
was opened in Hualien City.

01:10:03.782 --> 01:10:06.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They translate written publications

01:10:06.118 --> 01:10:09.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and produce audio publications in Amis.

01:10:09.321 --> 01:10:13.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Hualien Amis Congregation,
there are 80 publishers.

01:10:13.659 --> 01:10:17.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Five serve as elders and 22 are regular pioneers.

01:10:18.397 --> 01:10:21.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They conduct over 70 Bible studies each month.

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:26.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These brothers search out
Amis-speaking people in Hualien City,

01:10:26.105 --> 01:10:30.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where they live 
alongside Chinese- and Min Nan-speaking people.

01:10:30.276 --> 01:10:34.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the mountains,
Amis-speaking people are more isolated,

01:10:34.313 --> 01:10:37.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so our brothers travel long distances,

01:10:37.216 --> 01:10:40.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
using scooters,
to share the good news with them.

01:10:40.386 --> 01:10:44.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers and sisters
in the Hualien Amis Congregation

01:10:44.256 --> 01:10:46.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
send you their warm love.

01:10:47.559 --> 01:10:49.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the world headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:10:49.762 --> 01:10:51.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
