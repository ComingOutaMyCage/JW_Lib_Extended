Welcome to this special news update.

00:00:04.608 --> 00:00:06.610 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
As reported

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.446 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in the “Newsroom” section of jw.org,

00:00:09.446 --> 00:00:12.616 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on November 30, 2018,

00:00:12.616 --> 00:00:16.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the South Korean government
released 57 of our brothers

00:00:16.787 --> 00:00:20.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had been imprisoned
for conscientious objection.

00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:24.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body,
together with our worldwide brotherhood,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rejoices with these brothers
and their families.

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:32.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Ministry of Justice
granted an early release for our brothers

00:00:32.845 --> 00:00:35.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had already served at least 6 months

00:00:35.347 --> 00:00:37.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of their 18-month sentence.

00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:40.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We expect that the remaining eight brothers

00:00:40.644 --> 00:00:43.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will also be released
sometime after they’ve served

00:00:43.814 --> 00:00:46.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
six months of their sentence.

00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:48.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will be the last

00:00:48.402 --> 00:00:51.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the more than 19,000 Witnesses

00:00:51.614 --> 00:00:55.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have been sent
to prison in Korea since 1953.

00:00:56.911 --> 00:01:00.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what led to this momentous event?

00:01:00.164 --> 00:01:02.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During 2018,

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:06.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a series of historic court rulings in Korea

00:01:06.045 --> 00:01:09.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
finally recognized
conscientious objection

00:01:09.214 --> 00:01:11.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a fundamental right.

00:01:11.884 --> 00:01:16.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This development
now puts South Korea in line

00:01:16.013 --> 00:01:18.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with many other countries in the world

00:01:18.265 --> 00:01:21.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who say that refraining
from military service

00:01:21.018 --> 00:01:24.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for religious reasons is not a crime.

00:01:24.897 --> 00:01:27.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result of these rulings,

00:01:27.775 --> 00:01:32.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the prison doors
were opened for 57 brothers.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.420 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Recently, our branch received a report

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.339 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from the elders appointed to assist

00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:52.132 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
our imprisoned brothers.

00:01:52.132 --> 00:01:54.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They said that brothers
who have served at least six months

00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:58.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of their sentence
could be released early on parole.

00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:04.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was such great news
that I almost couldn’t believe it.

00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:08.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My son will be released
two months earlier than expected.

00:02:08.774 --> 00:02:11.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve heard that two months
in prison feels very long.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, even a single day feels long.

00:02:14.154 --> 00:02:16.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since our brothers in the past
had been allowed parole

00:02:16.281 --> 00:02:19.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after serving at least 14 months,

00:02:19.827 --> 00:02:21.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this was a great surprise to our brothers,

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many were
beside themselves with joy.

00:02:26.667 --> 00:02:30.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been over a year
since I’ve been able to hug my son.

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I meet him tomorrow,
the first thing I want to do

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:37.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is give him a warm hug

00:02:37.052 --> 00:02:41.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tell him he did a good job
staying strong in prison.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My son was a caregiver for ill inmates,
which can be dangerous

00:02:46.937 --> 00:02:48.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of bloodborne diseases.

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he’d always show me
he had no open wounds

00:02:52.234 --> 00:02:54.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on his hands and feet.

00:02:54.278 --> 00:02:56.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tomorrow, I’ll be able to hold those hands,

00:02:56.697 --> 00:02:59.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I don’t plan on letting go.

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:18.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, 57 brothers

00:03:18.886 --> 00:03:21.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were released at the same time

00:03:21.055 --> 00:03:23.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from 16 different prisons
throughout South Korea.

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s an amazing development!

00:03:31.482 --> 00:03:35.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Supreme Court’s
not-guilty decision last month

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was pivotal in our brothers’ early release.

00:03:39.114 --> 00:03:41.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It stated that those
‘who object to military service

00:03:41.533 --> 00:03:44.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘based on a conviction that is deep, firm,

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and genuine should be protected.’

00:03:47.164 --> 00:03:51.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many developments in the past few years
led up to this wonderful outcome.

00:03:53.545 --> 00:03:57.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, since 2007,
the Governing Body provided assistance

00:03:57.841 --> 00:04:01.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and encouragement to our brothers 
to make a fine defense in court.

00:04:03.097 --> 00:04:05.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result,
more than 120 not-guilty decisions

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:08.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were rendered in the lower courts.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Constitutional Court,
which had deliberated

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:15.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on this issue for many years,
rendered a historic decision,

00:04:15.567 --> 00:04:20.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
declaring that the absence
of alternative service is unconstitutional.

00:04:22.282 --> 00:04:25.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Furthermore, international
human rights organizations

00:04:25.911 --> 00:04:29.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recommended the releasing
of conscientious objectors.

00:04:31.792 --> 00:04:33.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, our brothers worldwide

00:04:33.794 --> 00:04:36.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have prayed incessantly
for our imprisoned brothers.

00:04:36.922 --> 00:04:39.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We believe these prayers

00:04:39.299 --> 00:04:42.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were an important factor
that brought about this great change.

00:04:44.054 --> 00:04:46.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They also sent
many letters of encouragement

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our brothers to the branch,

00:04:48.892 --> 00:04:52.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and every one of these
were forwarded to them.

00:04:54.898 --> 00:04:59.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no doubt these letters
helped our brothers to endure.

00:04:59.153 --> 00:05:02.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now our brothers
who were separated from their families

00:05:02.739 --> 00:05:05.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for many months have been reunited.

00:05:06.785 --> 00:05:09.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve been looking forward
to this day so much,

00:05:09.997 --> 00:05:13.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m so happy
to be with my family again.

00:05:13.417 --> 00:05:15.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to Jehovah’s protection,

00:05:15.961 --> 00:05:19.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re able to have our son
back in our arms in good health.

00:05:20.883 --> 00:05:23.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We welcome this decision
and are overjoyed

00:05:23.886 --> 00:05:26.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the early release of our brothers.

00:05:26.305 --> 00:05:29.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We look forward
to seeing our brothers using their freedom

00:05:29.641 --> 00:05:31.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to bring praise to Jehovah.

00:05:31.894 --> 00:05:35.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has brought salvation
and shown favor to our brothers

00:05:35.564 --> 00:05:39.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
walking the path of integrity
for the past 65 years.

00:05:39.234 --> 00:05:42.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are grateful
for Jehovah’s loving care.

00:05:43.989 --> 00:05:47.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 2:19 states:

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:51.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is agreeable
when someone endures hardship

00:05:51.163 --> 00:05:55.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and suffers unjustly
because of conscience toward God.”

00:05:56.418 --> 00:05:59.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This strongly applies
to you brothers in Korea.

00:05:59.922 --> 00:06:03.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through your long legacy
of faith and endurance,

00:06:03.258 --> 00:06:06.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have set
a sterling example of integrity

00:06:06.428 --> 00:06:09.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and given a powerful witness.

00:06:09.181 --> 00:06:13.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result, you have
Jehovah’s smile of approval.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our thanks go to your families
and all those around the world

00:06:19.233 --> 00:06:21.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have kept you in their prayers.

00:06:21.693 --> 00:06:23.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The words of Romans 10:11

00:06:23.946 --> 00:06:27.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
echo a fundamental truth about Jehovah:

00:06:27.366 --> 00:06:32.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No one who rests his faith
on him will be disappointed.”

00:06:32.162 --> 00:06:37.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, all praise and honor go to Jehovah!
