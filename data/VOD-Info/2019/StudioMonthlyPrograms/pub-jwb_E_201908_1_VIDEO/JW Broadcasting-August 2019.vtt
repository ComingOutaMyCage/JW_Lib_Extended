Welcome to JW Broadcasting.

00:00:05.021 --> 00:00:07.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are some highlights
from this month’s program.

00:00:07.857 --> 00:00:10.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What should we do if we encounter spiritism

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in some form?

00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:14.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how can we help

00:00:14.164 --> 00:00:16.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
others break free from it?

00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:20.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This dramatization will provide
some valuable principles.

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:24.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve all beheld the wonders of creation.

00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:26.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This month’s beautiful music video

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:29.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will move us to pause,

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:31.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think, and thank Jehovah

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:34.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for his magnificent works.

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:39.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we go to world headquarters
to visit another museum.

00:00:39.923 --> 00:00:43.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see how, in our time, Jehovah is

00:00:43.226 --> 00:00:46.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
blessing “a people for his name.”

00:00:46.596 --> 00:00:49.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the August 2019 edition

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:51.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:13.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our broadcast this month has the theme

00:01:13.757 --> 00:01:16.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Cherish Your Privilege of Prayer.”

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think it’s appropriate

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:21.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to label prayer as a miracle?

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:24.200 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Miracles are described

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.102 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in our New World Translation

00:01:26.102 --> 00:01:28.238 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Glossary of Bible Terms”

00:01:28.238 --> 00:01:31.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “actions or phenomena

00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:33.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that surpass all powers

00:01:33.977 --> 00:01:37.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“known to humans and are attributed

00:01:37.247 --> 00:01:40.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a supernatural agency.”

00:01:40.083 --> 00:01:43.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does prayer fit that description?

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The moment you say a prayer,

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your innermost thoughts and feelings

00:01:49.392 --> 00:01:51.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are communicated instantly to the Creator

00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:54.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from wherever you are

00:01:54.063 --> 00:01:57.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even if you pray silently.

00:01:57.233 --> 00:02:01.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s certainly
beyond any power that humans know.

00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:03.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, the fact that a human

00:02:03.873 --> 00:02:05.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can call out to God in prayer

00:02:05.975 --> 00:02:08.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be heard by him

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:11.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is truly a miracle.

00:02:11.347 --> 00:02:16.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s only
by the undeserved kindness of Jehovah

00:02:16.052 --> 00:02:19.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can approach
his heavenly throne in prayer.

00:02:19.956 --> 00:02:23.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today our lives are very complicated

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, in some cases, very troubled.

00:02:26.563 --> 00:02:30.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether young or old, there are times

00:02:30.633 --> 00:02:34.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may feel overwhelmed with our problems.

00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:39.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At other times,
we may simply feel alone and helpless.

00:02:39.175 --> 00:02:41.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we do?

00:02:41.477 --> 00:02:45.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul says that prayer will help.

00:02:45.615 --> 00:02:49.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bible to Philippians 4:6

00:02:49.786 --> 00:02:54.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and listen
to his spirit-inspired recommendations:

00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:58.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be anxious over anything,

00:02:58.528 --> 00:03:02.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but in everything by prayer and supplication

00:03:02.332 --> 00:03:04.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“along with thanksgiving,

00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:07.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let your petitions be made known to God.”

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:11.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Paul is saying
that in all circumstances of life,

00:03:11.774 --> 00:03:14.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prayer is essential.

00:03:14.177 --> 00:03:16.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While no one around us

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can see the inner struggles we may be having,

00:03:20.683 --> 00:03:22.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sees them.

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:24.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will he do?

00:03:24.721 --> 00:03:26.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read verse 7:

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And the peace of God
that surpasses all understanding

00:03:31.861 --> 00:03:35.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will guard your hearts
and your mental powers

00:03:35.164 --> 00:03:37.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of Christ Jesus.”

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:41.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This incomparable “peace of God”

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is an unusual tranquillity

00:03:44.274 --> 00:03:47.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enjoyed by Jehovah’s dedicated servants,

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even in the most trying circumstances.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you felt that inner peace

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that results
from intimate communication with Jehovah?

00:03:58.187 --> 00:04:01.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How much we benefit from prayer

00:04:01.724 --> 00:04:04.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is closely related to the strength

00:04:04.427 --> 00:04:08.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:12.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A key factor in that relationship

00:04:12.068 --> 00:04:15.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is found at Psalm 37:3:

00:04:16.806 --> 00:04:20.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Trust in Jehovah and do what is good;

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:24.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reside in the earth,
and act with faithfulness.”

00:04:24.814 --> 00:04:29.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likely you’d agree that when we need
to talk to someone about our worries,

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:31.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we go to a trusted friend.

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:33.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:04:33.022 --> 00:04:36.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s because we’ve developed
a relationship with him.

00:04:36.426 --> 00:04:39.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows us and our situation,

00:04:39.495 --> 00:04:42.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we know we can count on him.

00:04:42.432 --> 00:04:44.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than ever,

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need
a close personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:04:49.238 --> 00:04:53.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For that to be possible, we must be convinced

00:04:53.609 --> 00:04:58.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah knows
who we are and that he understands us

00:04:58.614 --> 00:05:01.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—our situation, our worries,

00:05:01.617 --> 00:05:05.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our concerns, and our needs.

00:05:05.355 --> 00:05:07.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what Jehovah promises

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:10.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in verses 4 and 5:

00:05:11.427 --> 00:05:14.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Find exquisite delight in Jehovah,

00:05:14.163 --> 00:05:17.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he will grant you
the desires of your heart.

00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:19.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Commit your way to Jehovah;

00:05:19.602 --> 00:05:23.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rely on him, and he will act in your behalf.”

00:05:24.674 --> 00:05:27.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah does know who we are.

00:05:27.477 --> 00:05:31.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He understands us better than anyone else,

00:05:31.447 --> 00:05:35.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even better than we understand ourselves.

00:05:35.151 --> 00:05:38.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He invites us to trust him,

00:05:38.221 --> 00:05:41.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he promises to act in our behalf.

00:05:41.391 --> 00:05:44.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The miracle of prayer lets us experience

00:05:44.494 --> 00:05:49.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s love in a truly intimate way.

00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:54.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our Father personally
takes the time to listen to us;

00:05:54.003 --> 00:05:57.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he has not delegated that to anyone else.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, you might be wondering,

00:06:00.343 --> 00:06:05.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‛Why would the Creator
of the universe want to listen to me?’

00:06:05.348 --> 00:06:10.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The inspired answer at 1 Peter 5:7 says:

00:06:10.353 --> 00:06:13.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Because he cares for you.”

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:16.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your determination to keep doing

00:06:16.359 --> 00:06:18.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the best you can to serve him

00:06:18.694 --> 00:06:21.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in spite of all the problems you face

00:06:21.597 --> 00:06:24.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
endears you to him.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He feels for you and is eager to help.

00:06:28.704 --> 00:06:31.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does that make you feel?

00:06:31.407 --> 00:06:35.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Psalm 116:1, it says:

00:06:36.512 --> 00:06:38.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I love Jehovah

00:06:38.514 --> 00:06:40.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because he hears my voice,

00:06:40.883 --> 00:06:43.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my pleas for help.”

00:06:43.252 --> 00:06:46.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though we can’t see him listening to us,

00:06:46.722 --> 00:06:48.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s as if we feel

00:06:48.724 --> 00:06:53.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s loving arms around us when we pray.

00:06:53.096 --> 00:06:56.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result, the more we pray,

00:06:56.566 --> 00:07:00.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more our love and trust in him grows.

00:07:00.303 --> 00:07:02.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What else will help us

00:07:02.338 --> 00:07:05.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build our love
and trust in our God, Jehovah?

00:07:05.708 --> 00:07:10.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s more than recognizing
that he hears our prayers.

00:07:10.346 --> 00:07:12.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must be convinced

00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:15.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he answers our prayers.

00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:20.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What evidence do we have
that Jehovah answers prayers?

00:07:20.156 --> 00:07:23.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at some
specific answers to prayers,

00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:26.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both past and present.

00:07:26.095 --> 00:07:30.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open your Bible to 2 Chronicles chapter 20.

00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:34.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Judah was threatened
by the combined forces

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:39.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Ammon and Moab
and the mountainous region of Seir,

00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:44.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King Jehoshaphat
humbly prayed for Jehovah’s help.

00:07:44.013 --> 00:07:46.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 12, he prayed:

00:07:47.917 --> 00:07:52.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“O our God,
will you not execute judgment on them?

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:54.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For we are powerless

00:07:54.924 --> 00:07:58.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“before this large crowd
that is coming against us;

00:07:58.261 --> 00:08:01.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and we do not know what we should do,

00:08:01.063 --> 00:08:04.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but our eyes are toward you.”

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was Jehovah’s answer?

00:08:06.769 --> 00:08:09.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was no voice from heaven.

00:08:09.472 --> 00:08:12.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah caused a prophet to speak up.

00:08:12.708 --> 00:08:14.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 15 says:

00:08:15.945 --> 00:08:18.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Here is what Jehovah says to you,

00:08:18.514 --> 00:08:22.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Do not be afraid or be terrified
because of this large crowd,

00:08:22.785 --> 00:08:27.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the battle is not yours but God’s.’”

00:08:27.123 --> 00:08:29.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then verse 17 continues:

00:08:29.992 --> 00:08:32.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You will not need to fight this battle.

00:08:32.828 --> 00:08:35.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Take your position, stand still,

00:08:35.865 --> 00:08:39.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see the salvation
of Jehovah in your behalf.”

00:08:40.803 --> 00:08:42.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you note the formula?

00:08:42.805 --> 00:08:47.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s dedicated servant
is facing a serious problem.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He prays specifically,

00:08:50.513 --> 00:08:55.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then he remains attentive to the answer.

00:08:55.017 --> 00:09:00.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer may have seemed
strange to Jehoshaphat.

00:09:00.022 --> 00:09:03.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah didn’t provide a battle plan.

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:06.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As strategies go, just walking out

00:09:06.562 --> 00:09:10.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to meet the enemy
doesn’t sound like a very good one.

00:09:10.032 --> 00:09:12.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehoshaphat discerned

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:15.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this was the answer from Jehovah,

00:09:15.238 --> 00:09:18.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he let it direct his actions.

00:09:18.274 --> 00:09:20.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What happened?

00:09:20.276 --> 00:09:22.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah fought for Judah

00:09:22.845 --> 00:09:26.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by striking confusion
into the ranks of the enemy

00:09:26.616 --> 00:09:29.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they slaughtered one another.

00:09:29.252 --> 00:09:32.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehoshaphat’s prayer was answered

00:09:32.188 --> 00:09:34.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a mighty way.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have examples in the first century

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of collective prayers being answered.

00:09:40.763 --> 00:09:43.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One occasion was when King Herod

00:09:43.899 --> 00:09:47.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was out to gain the favor of the Jews,

00:09:47.069 --> 00:09:50.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so he had the apostle Peter imprisoned

00:09:50.573 --> 00:09:53.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and placed under heavy guard.

00:09:53.075 --> 00:09:55.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would the congregation do?

00:09:55.344 --> 00:09:58.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acts 12:5 gives us the answer:

00:10:00.116 --> 00:10:02.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So Peter was being kept in the prison,

00:10:02.918 --> 00:10:07.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the congregation
was intensely praying to God for him.”

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:11.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did Jehovah answer their prayers
in behalf of Peter?

00:10:11.994 --> 00:10:16.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The account in verses 7-11 tells us

00:10:16.666 --> 00:10:20.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that an angel of Jehovah
led Peter out of jail

00:10:20.936 --> 00:10:24.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and delivered him to safety.

00:10:24.106 --> 00:10:28.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine how these events must have drawn

00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:31.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Christians in Jerusalem closer to Jehovah

00:10:31.681 --> 00:10:35.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they saw
that he had answered their prayers.

00:10:35.785 --> 00:10:38.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about today?

00:10:38.654 --> 00:10:43.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider the example
of our brothers in South Korea.

00:10:43.159 --> 00:10:48.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over the years,
more than 19,000 of our brothers

00:10:48.164 --> 00:10:52.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been imprisoned
as conscientious objectors

00:10:52.001 --> 00:10:54.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to military service.

00:10:54.003 --> 00:10:58.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you personally pray
in behalf of these brothers

00:10:58.307 --> 00:11:00.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they might endure in their faith

00:11:00.943 --> 00:11:04.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or that they might be released from prison

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if it was Jehovah’s will?

00:11:06.349 --> 00:11:08.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re sure that you did.

00:11:08.351 --> 00:11:12.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, many of you prayed
for these brothers by name,

00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:15.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as the congregation in the first century

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:18.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prayed in behalf of Peter.

00:11:18.294 --> 00:11:20.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With what result?

00:11:20.396 --> 00:11:25.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2018, a series
of court rulings in South Korea

00:11:25.134 --> 00:11:28.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
finally recognized conscientious objection

00:11:28.704 --> 00:11:32.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to military service for religious reasons

00:11:32.241 --> 00:11:35.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a fundamental human right,

00:11:35.478 --> 00:11:39.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our brothers
were gradually released

00:11:39.181 --> 00:11:41.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from their prison bonds.

00:11:41.183 --> 00:11:43.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think?

00:11:43.185 --> 00:11:45.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did Jehovah hear our prayers

00:11:45.721 --> 00:11:48.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in behalf of these dear brothers?

00:11:48.357 --> 00:11:51.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a worldwide brotherhood,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there can be no doubt

00:11:53.429 --> 00:11:56.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our incessant prayers to Jehovah

00:11:56.499 --> 00:12:01.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were a major factor
in these marvelous developments,

00:12:01.404 --> 00:12:04.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we praise and thank Jehovah

00:12:04.974 --> 00:12:07.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he’s heard our prayers.

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:11.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does this review
of how Jehovah answered the prayers

00:12:11.547 --> 00:12:15.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of his servants
in the past and present do for us?

00:12:15.217 --> 00:12:18.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doesn’t it build confidence that Jehovah

00:12:18.687 --> 00:12:22.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is listening to and acting on
the prayers of his people?

00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:26.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle John had that confidence.

00:12:26.862 --> 00:12:31.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wrote at 1 John 5:14:

00:12:32.234 --> 00:12:35.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And this is the confidence
that we have toward him,

00:12:35.638 --> 00:12:39.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that no matter what we ask
according to his will,

00:12:39.308 --> 00:12:41.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he hears us.”

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:43.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now the question is:

00:12:43.879 --> 00:12:46.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When was the last time
that Jehovah answered

00:12:46.882 --> 00:12:49.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one of your personal prayers?

00:12:49.652 --> 00:12:52.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We spend much time on learning

00:12:52.488 --> 00:12:55.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to pray and what to pray for,

00:12:55.758 --> 00:12:58.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but do we put forth enough effort

00:12:58.627 --> 00:13:02.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in identifying the answers to our prayers?

00:13:02.965 --> 00:13:06.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For us to have the closeness to Jehovah,

00:13:06.535 --> 00:13:09.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we must be certain that he’s listening

00:13:09.705 --> 00:13:13.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and responding to our personal prayers.

00:13:13.375 --> 00:13:16.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may not always be readily discernible

00:13:16.779 --> 00:13:19.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just how some prayers are answered.

00:13:19.715 --> 00:13:22.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what can we do?

00:13:22.051 --> 00:13:25.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take time to meditate on Jehovah’s response

00:13:25.754 --> 00:13:28.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to your prayerful requests.

00:13:28.491 --> 00:13:30.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re married,

00:13:30.493 --> 00:13:35.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
freely discuss matters
that you have prayed for in common

00:13:35.297 --> 00:13:38.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how Jehovah
may be answering those prayers.

00:13:38.868 --> 00:13:43.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be observant and alert to things
that are happening around you,

00:13:43.706 --> 00:13:46.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and learn to connect these things

00:13:46.775 --> 00:13:49.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the answers to your prayers.

00:13:49.545 --> 00:13:52.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make your prayers more specific,

00:13:52.515 --> 00:13:56.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’ll become
more keenly aware of Jehovah’s answers

00:13:56.785 --> 00:14:00.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even though they may be subtle.

00:14:00.723 --> 00:14:04.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Identifying your answered prayers

00:14:04.426 --> 00:14:08.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will make Jehovah more real to you.

00:14:08.531 --> 00:14:13.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This process
of identifying answers to our prayers

00:14:13.402 --> 00:14:18.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should be learned early on
in one’s spiritual development.

00:14:18.173 --> 00:14:22.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We cannot take it
for granted that our children

00:14:22.711 --> 00:14:26.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or our Bible students
will connect the answers

00:14:26.582 --> 00:14:29.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they receive to the prayers they’ve offered.

00:14:29.752 --> 00:14:31.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One Witness said,

00:14:31.954 --> 00:14:35.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I find that people feel closer to God

00:14:35.591 --> 00:14:38.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“if I help them to recognize

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
answers to their prayers.”

00:14:40.996 --> 00:14:43.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if we can’t identify

00:14:43.799 --> 00:14:47.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the answer to one of our prayers?

00:14:47.069 --> 00:14:51.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does that mean
it wasn’t according to Jehovah’s will?

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not necessarily.

00:14:53.409 --> 00:14:58.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are two important factors
that might be involved.

00:14:58.047 --> 00:15:01.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One is that Jehovah knows

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:04.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the best time and way

00:15:04.353 --> 00:15:06.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to answer our prayers.

00:15:06.722 --> 00:15:10.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He takes all matters into consideration.

00:15:10.926 --> 00:15:13.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer may not come

00:15:13.362 --> 00:15:17.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to our timetable, but it will come.

00:15:17.433 --> 00:15:20.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we must be patient

00:15:20.235 --> 00:15:23.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and keep looking for the answer.

00:15:23.072 --> 00:15:26.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second factor that Jehovah considers

00:15:26.709 --> 00:15:29.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the issue raised by Satan

00:15:29.578 --> 00:15:32.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding man’s integrity.

00:15:32.281 --> 00:15:35.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen again to the challenge Satan makes

00:15:35.751 --> 00:15:40.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded at Job 1:10, 11:

00:15:41.857 --> 00:15:44.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Have you not put up a protective hedge

00:15:44.059 --> 00:15:47.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“around him and his house
and everything he has?

00:15:47.563 --> 00:15:50.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You have blessed the work of his hands,

00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:53.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and his livestock
has spread out in the land.

00:15:53.435 --> 00:15:56.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But, for a change, stretch out your hand

00:15:56.538 --> 00:15:58.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and strike everything he has,

00:15:58.774 --> 00:16:02.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will surely
curse you to your very face.”

00:16:03.512 --> 00:16:05.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah permitted this issue

00:16:05.514 --> 00:16:09.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be raised out of love
for his intelligent creatures.

00:16:09.518 --> 00:16:12.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He permitted Job to undergo a test

00:16:12.721 --> 00:16:16.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Satan before the entire universe.

00:16:16.825 --> 00:16:20.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gives his creatures the privilege

00:16:20.696 --> 00:16:24.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of proving the Devil a liar
and of removing the slander

00:16:24.867 --> 00:16:27.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only from God’s name

00:16:27.136 --> 00:16:29.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also from their own.

00:16:29.938 --> 00:16:33.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah, seeing the entire issue,

00:16:33.942 --> 00:16:37.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may allow his servants to endure trials.

00:16:37.179 --> 00:16:39.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that doesn’t mean

00:16:39.548 --> 00:16:42.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s not answering
the prayer of the afflicted.

00:16:42.985 --> 00:16:47.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we are under trial,
we may have prayed for relief,

00:16:47.623 --> 00:16:50.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we may have also prayed:

00:16:50.526 --> 00:16:54.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let your name be sanctified.”

00:16:54.396 --> 00:16:57.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must remain convinced that Jehovah

00:16:57.533 --> 00:17:00.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will not simply answer a prayer;

00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:03.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will provide the best answer.

00:17:03.739 --> 00:17:08.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t it true that
when we maintain our integrity,

00:17:08.677 --> 00:17:11.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even through serious illness,

00:17:11.814 --> 00:17:15.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it can be a tremendous witness to others?

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:18.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the case with Jerod Septer.

00:17:21.824 --> 00:17:24.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Word says:

00:17:24.693 --> 00:17:27.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Remember, then, your Grand Creator

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:29.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the days of your youth,

00:17:29.264 --> 00:17:33.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the days of distress come.”

00:17:33.035 --> 00:17:35.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And “the days of distress”

00:17:35.204 --> 00:17:39.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they arrived early on Jerod at 11.

00:17:39.274 --> 00:17:43.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jerod was diagnosed
with lymphoma cancer in the middle of 1991.

00:17:44.613 --> 00:17:47.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We started trying
to figure out how we could get him

00:17:47.883 --> 00:17:51.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the treatment that he needed,
of course, but in no way would we accept

00:17:51.353 --> 00:17:54.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a blood transfusion, and neither would Jerod.

00:17:54.389 --> 00:17:58.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jerod was in the hospital,
Child Protective Services

00:17:58.694 --> 00:18:00.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did investigate us.

00:18:00.229 --> 00:18:02.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were concerned there was negligence.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:04.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just adding to the pain.

00:18:04.633 --> 00:18:08.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The way it turned out,
they backed completely away from that.

00:18:08.837 --> 00:18:10.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They realized that we hadn’t been negligent.

00:18:10.873 --> 00:18:15.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as we faced different situations,
we’d pray at the time,

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:17.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to have miraculous answers,

00:18:17.913 --> 00:18:22.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but for Jehovah to open our eyes
and to be able to find things.

00:18:22.518 --> 00:18:26.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it seemed as though
he was really directing us,

00:18:26.388 --> 00:18:29.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we could take care
of ourselves spiritually

00:18:29.024 --> 00:18:34.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through this situation as well as take care
of Jerod’s medical needs.

00:18:34.029 --> 00:18:36.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember

00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:39.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many times falling on my knees

00:18:39.268 --> 00:18:41.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and praying and thinking: ‘This is it.

00:18:41.804 --> 00:18:44.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m tested beyond what I can bear.’

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah would strengthen me.

00:18:47.376 --> 00:18:49.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And someone would come,

00:18:49.011 --> 00:18:52.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or they would say something.

00:18:52.047 --> 00:18:53.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they fed us.

00:18:53.949 --> 00:18:56.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brother made a schedule, and he said,

00:18:56.585 --> 00:18:59.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You’re going to feed these friends.”

00:18:59.021 --> 00:19:01.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the brother’s instructions were:

00:19:01.223 --> 00:19:03.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You don’t bring it
and just drop off the food.

00:19:03.258 --> 00:19:05.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You stay with those friends.”

00:19:05.327 --> 00:19:08.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It made me cry

00:19:08.096 --> 00:19:10.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the love and the care that we experienced.

00:19:10.365 --> 00:19:12.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One time, I remember

00:19:12.367 --> 00:19:14.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the hallways of this hospital

00:19:14.369 --> 00:19:17.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1,500 miles (2,400 km) away from our home—

00:19:17.306 --> 00:19:19.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
started filling up with people.

00:19:19.808 --> 00:19:21.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To me, that was answering prayers too.

00:19:23.679 --> 00:19:26.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was hard for us
to get out of the hospital,

00:19:26.682 --> 00:19:28.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they recorded talks.

00:19:28.517 --> 00:19:30.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would look us in the eye,
and they’d say:

00:19:30.986 --> 00:19:32.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now, you need to listen to this.

00:19:32.821 --> 00:19:34.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will keep you strong.”

00:19:35.924 --> 00:19:39.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jerod was worried about us,
and he made it clear

00:19:39.094 --> 00:19:41.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he was going to be fine.

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:44.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He just didn’t know if we were going to be.

00:19:44.399 --> 00:19:46.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He died

00:19:46.935 --> 00:19:50.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in June of 1992.

00:19:50.505 --> 00:19:52.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was at home.

00:19:52.941 --> 00:19:56.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the last thing he said to us was,

00:19:56.378 --> 00:20:00.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Work hard so we can all be together again.”

00:20:08.357 --> 00:20:10.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s numbing

00:20:10.125 --> 00:20:13.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it’s almost like
you’re living a nightmare

00:20:13.428 --> 00:20:17.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you never think
that those things will happen to you,

00:20:20.936 --> 00:20:22.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it did.

00:20:22.938 --> 00:20:25.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want people to see me cry.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:29.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want pity, and I didn’t—

00:20:31.146 --> 00:20:33.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of that

00:20:33.148 --> 00:20:36.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—those negative feelings—
my imagination ran wild.

00:20:39.521 --> 00:20:42.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped me, I know,

00:20:42.324 --> 00:20:45.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was Gary putting into my heart and mind

00:20:45.994 --> 00:20:48.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this is a fight.

00:20:48.096 --> 00:20:50.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been a challenge for all mankind.

00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:53.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If you make it hard on them,
they won’t love you’

00:20:53.168 --> 00:20:56.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Satan said that
about Jehovah and individuals.

00:20:56.638 --> 00:20:58.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I would be giving in to that.

00:21:00.842 --> 00:21:03.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The strong feelings I had

00:21:03.078 --> 00:21:06.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my sorrow almost made me stop.

00:21:06.548 --> 00:21:10.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed a lot
to go back to the Kingdom Hall.

00:21:10.018 --> 00:21:15.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The congregation cried;
they lost a little boy.

00:21:15.057 --> 00:21:16.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t just Gary and Beth.

00:21:16.491 --> 00:21:18.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They lost a little boy.

00:21:18.493 --> 00:21:20.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They cried,

00:21:22.531 --> 00:21:25.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I didn’t feel alone.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:29.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we hugged; we cried together.

00:21:30.706 --> 00:21:33.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really benefited us to get right back

00:21:33.942 --> 00:21:37.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into spiritual focus
and to get our minds off ourselves.

00:21:37.245 --> 00:21:40.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I could’ve given in
to my pain and thought,

00:21:40.048 --> 00:21:41.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, I’m too heartbroken.’

00:21:41.917 --> 00:21:43.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It made me have more joy

00:21:43.952 --> 00:21:46.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I realized that now they have a hope.

00:21:48.056 --> 00:21:50.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People around us were vital

00:21:50.425 --> 00:21:52.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the support system Jehovah has—

00:21:52.461 --> 00:21:55.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his Word, his spirit.

00:21:55.764 --> 00:21:57.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah answered those prayers.

00:21:57.899 --> 00:22:00.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our goal was really to stay

00:22:00.535 --> 00:22:04.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the full-time ministry
(maybe doing something else),

00:22:04.106 --> 00:22:07.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we never, ever thought
we would be in the circuit work.

00:22:07.676 --> 00:22:11.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to have our daughter
working with her husband in the circuit work

00:22:11.847 --> 00:22:14.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it’s almost hard
to believe that it’s happening.

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:19.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We look forward to seeing Jerod again,
having him back with us.

00:22:19.254 --> 00:22:24.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I’m waiting,
and I know I’m not going to be disappointed.

00:22:24.259 --> 00:22:27.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How encouraging to know that Gary and Beth

00:22:27.496 --> 00:22:30.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are able to take vacation time
to travel occasionally

00:22:30.565 --> 00:22:33.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see their daughter and her husband,

00:22:33.435 --> 00:22:36.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are also serving in the traveling work.

00:22:36.872 --> 00:22:41.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And did you notice how Gary, Beth, and Jerod

00:22:41.443 --> 00:22:45.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
felt Jehovah’s loving support as they prayed

00:22:45.614 --> 00:22:48.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
throughout this heart-wrenching trial?

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:50.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They asked for wisdom

00:22:50.852 --> 00:22:53.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when seeking medical treatment for Jerod.

00:22:53.555 --> 00:22:57.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah put his arms around them and listened

00:22:57.626 --> 00:23:02.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they felt overwhelmed
with grief and negative feelings.

00:23:02.097 --> 00:23:06.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He strengthened
Jerod’s hope in the resurrection

00:23:06.134 --> 00:23:08.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helped Brother and Sister Septer

00:23:08.703 --> 00:23:11.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stay spiritually strong.

00:23:11.373 --> 00:23:13.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can there be any doubt

00:23:13.875 --> 00:23:17.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah was answering their prayers?

00:23:17.045 --> 00:23:20.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doesn’t that strengthen our conviction

00:23:20.048 --> 00:23:23.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will also answer Jerod’s prayer

00:23:23.718 --> 00:23:27.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they all will be together again?

00:23:27.055 --> 00:23:31.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, Jehovah didn’t miraculously cure Jerod.

00:23:31.793 --> 00:23:36.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But through his endurance and strong faith,

00:23:36.264 --> 00:23:39.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jerod gave a witness to the universe

00:23:39.568 --> 00:23:43.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that even a child that trusts in Jehovah

00:23:43.872 --> 00:23:47.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can prove his loyalty to death.

00:23:47.042 --> 00:23:50.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, other situations

00:23:50.278 --> 00:23:54.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may turn out differently
and not end up in death.

00:23:54.082 --> 00:23:57.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If an individual feels that relief

00:23:57.519 --> 00:24:00.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was because of Jehovah’s intervention,

00:24:00.655 --> 00:24:03.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he should certainly give thanks.

00:24:03.425 --> 00:24:07.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, we must recognize that Jehovah knows

00:24:07.496 --> 00:24:10.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the best way to handle matters

00:24:10.132 --> 00:24:13.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that it results in honor to his name

00:24:13.869 --> 00:24:18.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to the lasting good of his servants.

00:24:18.173 --> 00:24:22.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, it’s worth mentioning that the Bible

00:24:22.244 --> 00:24:25.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
often connects
our remaining spiritually alert

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with our need to pray.

00:24:28.016 --> 00:24:31.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 26:41,

00:24:31.586 --> 00:24:33.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said:

00:24:33.488 --> 00:24:37.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep on the watch and pray continually.”

00:24:37.759 --> 00:24:40.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 Peter 4:7,

00:24:40.829 --> 00:24:42.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter wrote:

00:24:43.665 --> 00:24:47.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the end of all things has drawn close.

00:24:47.169 --> 00:24:49.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore, be sound in mind,

00:24:49.905 --> 00:24:53.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be vigilant with a view to prayers.”

00:24:54.543 --> 00:24:58.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Indeed, our prayers are so important.

00:24:58.213 --> 00:25:00.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our personal prayers will help us

00:25:00.749 --> 00:25:05.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to remain spiritually alert
and active in God’s service

00:25:05.554 --> 00:25:08.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we await the great tribulation

00:25:08.256 --> 00:25:11.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that lies just ahead of us.

00:25:11.293 --> 00:25:15.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in summary, our prayers to Jehovah

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:19.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reveal the closeness
of our relationship with him

00:25:19.134 --> 00:25:23.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the degree of our dependence upon him.

00:25:23.205 --> 00:25:26.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They show the trueness of our faith,

00:25:26.208 --> 00:25:28.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the depth of our devotion,

00:25:28.777 --> 00:25:32.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the genuineness of our appreciation.

00:25:32.714 --> 00:25:37.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our prayers also help us
to remain spiritually alert

00:25:37.285 --> 00:25:39.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we endure these last days

00:25:39.988 --> 00:25:42.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the great tribulation.

00:25:42.724 --> 00:25:46.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll be drawn even closer to Jehovah

00:25:46.228 --> 00:25:51.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we learn to recognize
his answers to our prayers.

00:25:51.032 --> 00:25:54.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we can be assured that Jehovah

00:25:54.569 --> 00:25:58.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will not fail in giving us
the desires of our heart

00:25:58.073 --> 00:26:02.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we continue rendering him sacred service.

00:26:02.711 --> 00:26:06.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May we all cherish our marvelous,

00:26:06.348 --> 00:26:09.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
miraculous privilege of prayer.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at one practical example

00:26:14.122 --> 00:26:17.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of when prayer is of utmost importance

00:26:17.626 --> 00:26:21.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—when confronted
with the powers of wicked spirits.

00:26:21.463 --> 00:26:25.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Spiritism is very real and dangerous.

00:26:25.734 --> 00:26:27.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, with Jehovah’s help,

00:26:27.936 --> 00:26:32.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people can break free from its hold.

00:26:32.173 --> 00:26:34.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this dramatization,

00:26:34.409 --> 00:26:38.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how one sister
helped her Bible student to do that.

00:26:46.054 --> 00:26:48.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Emma and I were so worried

00:26:48.657 --> 00:26:51.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about her Bible study, Palesa.

00:26:51.092 --> 00:26:54.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She had spent another sleepless night

00:26:54.329 --> 00:26:58.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after again hearing
her dead grandmother’s voice,

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:02.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
plus the sound of slamming doors
and items crashing in the house.

00:27:12.614 --> 00:27:16.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Palesa had put an amulet
on her baby’s wrist for protection,

00:27:16.518 --> 00:27:19.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the terror continued all night long.

00:27:21.656 --> 00:27:24.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, it wasn’t really her grandmother,

00:27:24.959 --> 00:27:28.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and nothing in the house was broken;

00:27:28.697 --> 00:27:31.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the attack was real.

00:27:39.341 --> 00:27:42.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stories about the spirit world weren’t new to me.

00:27:42.877 --> 00:27:46.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our neighbors, the people I work with,

00:27:46.314 --> 00:27:48.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the people in our territory

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:52.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—almost everyone believes in spirits,
whether they admit it or not.

00:27:53.888 --> 00:27:58.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No—more than believe—they fear them!

00:27:59.828 --> 00:28:04.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had only been studying the Bible
about six months longer than Palesa.

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:10.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But my study had proved to me
that wicked spirits are here on earth,

00:28:10.038 --> 00:28:12.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they try to interact with people,

00:28:12.974 --> 00:28:15.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that they are dangerous enemies.

00:28:18.213 --> 00:28:20.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Emma called the elders for help.

00:28:20.882 --> 00:28:23.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She didn’t want us to handle
the situation on our own.

00:28:31.259 --> 00:28:33.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Emma told the story,

00:28:33.528 --> 00:28:37.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to speak up and tell the elders
that she was leaving things out.

00:28:40.335 --> 00:28:45.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I was surprised when the elders
said they didn’t need all the details.

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:50.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They explained that while we are aware
of the danger the demons pose,

00:28:50.345 --> 00:28:54.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we do not spend time
talking about their activities.

00:28:54.282 --> 00:28:57.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even Jesus, when he was on earth,

00:28:57.218 --> 00:29:00.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could have told his disciples many stories

00:29:00.221 --> 00:29:02.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the doings of wicked spirits,

00:29:02.957 --> 00:29:07.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but instead,
he focused on Jehovah and His activities.

00:29:07.962 --> 00:29:10.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should do the same

00:29:10.198 --> 00:29:13.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
instead of telling stories about what the demons

00:29:13.501 --> 00:29:16.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may or may not have done.

00:29:16.037 --> 00:29:20.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elders skillfully used the Bible,
shepherding everyone.

00:29:20.475 --> 00:29:23.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read Ephesians 6:11:

00:29:23.244 --> 00:29:26.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Put on the complete suit of armor from God

00:29:26.648 --> 00:29:29.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that you may be able to stand firm

00:29:29.651 --> 00:29:31.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against the crafty acts of the Devil.”

00:29:36.057 --> 00:29:39.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those instructions were so important.

00:29:40.094 --> 00:29:44.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A soldier would be vulnerable
if he only wore part of his armor

00:29:44.098 --> 00:29:47.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or if he didn’t keep it in good repair.

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we read Ephesians 4:27:

00:29:56.478 --> 00:29:59.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not give the Devil an opportunity.”

00:30:00.515 --> 00:30:03.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elders explained to Palesa

00:30:03.518 --> 00:30:05.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the string around her daughter’s wrist

00:30:05.653 --> 00:30:08.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not part of the armor from God.

00:30:08.456 --> 00:30:13.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, it is giving Satan
an opportunity to continue to harass the family.

00:30:15.864 --> 00:30:20.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers reminded us
that anyone who wants Jehovah’s protection

00:30:20.468 --> 00:30:22.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must completely break free

00:30:22.604 --> 00:30:25.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from anything associated with superstition,

00:30:25.507 --> 00:30:28.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spiritism, and demon worship.

00:30:29.143 --> 00:30:34.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who would ever choose to side
with wicked spirits instead of with Jehovah?

00:30:37.785 --> 00:30:41.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Emma reminded Palesa
of how urgent the situation was.

00:30:43.491 --> 00:30:46.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But only Palesa could decide what she would do.

00:31:04.145 --> 00:31:07.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to be a loyal servant of Jehovah.

00:31:07.582 --> 00:31:10.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why I’m getting baptized.

00:31:10.351 --> 00:31:13.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve decided not to listen to or tell

00:31:13.555 --> 00:31:16.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any more stories about the demons.

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:18.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But more than that,

00:31:18.192 --> 00:31:21.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to look at other parts of my life.

00:31:21.529 --> 00:31:26.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Am I doing anything
that would “give the Devil an opportunity”?

00:31:26.334 --> 00:31:31.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly,
there are still changes I need to make.

00:31:31.573 --> 00:31:33.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how they prayed

00:31:33.575 --> 00:31:36.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Jehovah’s direction?

00:31:36.077 --> 00:31:40.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They followed the principle of Psalm 37:5:

00:31:40.315 --> 00:31:42.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Commit your way to Jehovah;

00:31:42.617 --> 00:31:46.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rely on him, and he will act in your behalf.”

00:31:47.822 --> 00:31:49.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as you noticed,

00:31:49.591 --> 00:31:52.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he’s committing
his life course to Jehovah,

00:31:52.827 --> 00:31:57.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thomas’ Christian conscience
has now started to guide him.

00:31:57.832 --> 00:32:00.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he likely realizes

00:32:00.168 --> 00:32:05.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he has to safeguard his heart
from things that may tempt him.

00:32:05.173 --> 00:32:07.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this Bethel Morning Worship,

00:32:07.976 --> 00:32:12.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Morris of the Governing Body
helps us to see why it requires

00:32:12.213 --> 00:32:16.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
effort to protect 
our relationship with Jehovah.

00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:18.252 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This morning, I thought we’d talk about accepting

00:32:18.252 --> 00:32:20.421 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the facts about our figurative heart

00:32:20.421 --> 00:32:22.624 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and how that safeguards

00:32:22.624 --> 00:32:24.826 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
our relationship with Jehovah.

00:32:24.826 --> 00:32:26.995 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read the day’s text

00:32:26.995 --> 00:32:29.931 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in its entirety

00:32:29.931 --> 00:32:33.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jeremiah chapter 17.

00:32:33.334 --> 00:32:36.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a sobering inspired thought

00:32:36.871 --> 00:32:39.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from our heavenly Father!

00:32:39.707 --> 00:32:42.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah chapter 17

00:32:42.243 --> 00:32:44.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll read verse 9:

00:32:44.912 --> 00:32:47.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The heart is more treacherous

00:32:47.715 --> 00:32:50.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than anything else and is desperate.”

00:32:50.918 --> 00:32:52.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there we have it.

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the truth.

00:32:54.922 --> 00:32:57.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what Jehovah makes very clear to us

00:32:57.425 --> 00:33:02.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that each and every one of us
has to deal with a treacherous,

00:33:02.096 --> 00:33:04.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or deceitful, figurative heart.

00:33:04.399 --> 00:33:06.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how encompassing

00:33:06.401 --> 00:33:08.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the expression here

00:33:08.703 --> 00:33:13.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“more treacherous than anything else.”

00:33:13.574 --> 00:33:17.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what complicates it even more
is that it’s desperate.

00:33:17.712 --> 00:33:20.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It always wants its way

00:33:20.682 --> 00:33:23.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so a lot to meditate on.

00:33:23.017 --> 00:33:26.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now,
Jehovah put it here for the very reason

00:33:26.754 --> 00:33:29.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have to accept this fact.

00:33:29.023 --> 00:33:32.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to safeguard our relationship with him,

00:33:32.994 --> 00:33:35.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to accept that this is the case.

00:33:35.329 --> 00:33:39.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you could be a fine Christian for many years

00:33:39.667 --> 00:33:44.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—mature, nice outlook, nice attitude.

00:33:44.005 --> 00:33:48.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you ever find yourself
forgetting Jehovah’s estimation

00:33:48.776 --> 00:33:53.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what we have within us,
in our figurative heart,

00:33:53.014 --> 00:33:57.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we’re in danger
because the Devil will always exploit

00:33:57.485 --> 00:34:00.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the fact that our imperfect figurative hearts

00:34:00.521 --> 00:34:02.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are treacherous and deceitful

00:34:02.924 --> 00:34:06.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than anything else
and are desperate.

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:08.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So accept that fact.

00:34:08.663 --> 00:34:11.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not that we want to dwell on it,
and you start feeling,

00:34:11.532 --> 00:34:13.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, what a miserable person I am!’

00:34:13.935 --> 00:34:17.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though that is something
the apostle Paul acknowledged,

00:34:17.572 --> 00:34:19.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s just accepting the fact.

00:34:19.574 --> 00:34:22.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we’re cautious about allowing

00:34:22.677 --> 00:34:26.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the treacherous heart to lead us astray.

00:34:26.013 --> 00:34:29.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, perhaps you haven’t thought
about this in a while,

00:34:29.617 --> 00:34:31.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but notice what Jesus said

00:34:31.686 --> 00:34:34.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a fundamental truth for all of us—

00:34:34.021 --> 00:34:36.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here in Matthew chapter 6

00:34:36.791 --> 00:34:41.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what we sometimes
refer to as the model prayer.

00:34:41.796 --> 00:34:44.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew chapter 6

00:34:44.932 --> 00:34:49.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and a lot of spiritual food for thought,

00:34:49.937 --> 00:34:54.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of course, anything Jesus said
is spiritual food for thought)

00:34:54.942 --> 00:34:59.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 13 of Matthew chapter 6:

00:34:59.947 --> 00:35:04.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And do not bring us into temptation,

00:35:04.152 --> 00:35:08.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but deliver us from the wicked one.”

00:35:08.089 --> 00:35:13.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s been there for all these years.

00:35:13.094 --> 00:35:16.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could personally reflect on,

00:35:16.097 --> 00:35:21.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘When was the last time we mentioned
that in a prayer to our Father, Jehovah:

00:35:21.102 --> 00:35:24.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘“Do not bring us into temptation

00:35:24.305 --> 00:35:28.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but deliver us from the wicked one,”
or “rescue us from the wicked one”?’

00:35:28.709 --> 00:35:31.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are we really saying there?

00:35:31.546 --> 00:35:36.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’re asking our heavenly Father
to guide and help us

00:35:36.417 --> 00:35:41.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we’re not “overreached by Satan”
—very simple.

00:35:41.422 --> 00:35:44.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the closer we get to the end,

00:35:44.358 --> 00:35:47.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make no mistake, it’s even more urgent

00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:52.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep in mind the need
to beg Jehovah not to bring us into temptation

00:35:52.834 --> 00:35:56.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to guide us so that we’ll be delivered

00:35:56.404 --> 00:36:01.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from this wicked one
who wants to exploit the fact that we have

00:36:01.042 --> 00:36:05.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a treacherous,
traitorous figurative heart

00:36:05.613 --> 00:36:09.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can ruin our relationship
with Jehovah personally.

00:36:09.951 --> 00:36:13.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the apostle Paul recognized this,

00:36:13.387 --> 00:36:15.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s quite interesting what he wrote

00:36:15.456 --> 00:36:20.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to his beloved brothers
in Thessalonians, that first letter.

00:36:20.461 --> 00:36:23.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you’d find 1 Thessalonians,

00:36:23.497 --> 00:36:26.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in chapter 3,

00:36:26.334 --> 00:36:30.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found this quite revealing.

00:36:30.538 --> 00:36:33.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And tying in with the thought

00:36:33.207 --> 00:36:35.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of accepting the facts
about how our figurative heart

00:36:35.543 --> 00:36:40.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
safeguards our relationship
with our God and Father, Jehovah,

00:36:40.481 --> 00:36:45.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Thessalonians 3:5,

00:36:45.486 --> 00:36:49.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul writes: “That is why,
when I could bear it no longer,

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:52.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I sent to learn of your faithfulness,

00:36:52.026 --> 00:36:55.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[now notice] in case somehow

00:36:55.396 --> 00:36:58.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Tempter might have tempted you,

00:36:58.633 --> 00:37:01.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our labor
might have turned out to be in vain.”

00:37:01.836 --> 00:37:05.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he didn’t get into any specific detail.

00:37:05.439 --> 00:37:10.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it helps us to appreciate
that there’s this danger that somehow

00:37:10.444 --> 00:37:15.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Tempter, Satan the Devil,
might tempt us,

00:37:15.016 --> 00:37:17.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is connected with the need to beg

00:37:17.818 --> 00:37:21.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah to deliver us, or rescue us,
from the wicked one

00:37:21.789 --> 00:37:26.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his effort to tempt us to break our integrity

00:37:26.027 --> 00:37:31.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have our cherished relationship
with Jehovah be damaged.

00:37:31.032 --> 00:37:33.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he knows the heart is treacherous.

00:37:33.768 --> 00:37:38.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And whoever we are and however long
we’ve been in the truth,

00:37:38.272 --> 00:37:40.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember what Paul wrote to the Thessalonians

00:37:40.908 --> 00:37:43.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“somehow”—
because he’s always looking

00:37:43.377 --> 00:37:45.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to somehow lead us

00:37:45.913 --> 00:37:48.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into breaking our integrity to Jehovah God.

00:37:48.549 --> 00:37:52.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you think of Revelation chapter 12

00:37:52.753 --> 00:37:56.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and where we are in this stream of time,

00:37:56.390 --> 00:38:00.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(this occurred to me
when preparing these thoughts here)

00:38:00.461 --> 00:38:04.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation chapter 12
has very familiar thoughts here.

00:38:04.165 --> 00:38:08.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Devil is expelled from the heavens,

00:38:08.469 --> 00:38:11.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he and the demons, and notice

00:38:11.372 --> 00:38:14.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the familiar verse 12
of Revelation chapter 12:

00:38:14.542 --> 00:38:16.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘On this account be glad, you heavens

00:38:16.877 --> 00:38:20.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and [boy, they’re rejoicing]
those that reside in them!’

00:38:20.448 --> 00:38:22.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s an exclamation.

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:27.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice, though:
“Woe for the earth and for the sea,

00:38:27.288 --> 00:38:32.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because the Devil has come down to you,
having great anger,

00:38:32.059 --> 00:38:35.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing that he has a short period of time.”

00:38:35.096 --> 00:38:39.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if that was true
after he was ousted from the heavens,

00:38:39.767 --> 00:38:42.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what do you think about now?

00:38:42.169 --> 00:38:44.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s sobering.

00:38:44.772 --> 00:38:47.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to safeguard
our relationship with Jehovah

00:38:47.274 --> 00:38:51.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because notice verse 17 of the same chapter:

00:38:51.879 --> 00:38:55.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So the dragon became enraged.”

00:38:55.249 --> 00:38:58.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Great anger—he’s enraged,

00:38:58.819 --> 00:39:02.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s waging war with the remnant,
as it brings out here.

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:04.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And those that observe
the commandments of God

00:39:04.859 --> 00:39:08.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—anyone supporting the remnant—
this is a war.

00:39:08.362 --> 00:39:11.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the war
is that he’s out to somehow

00:39:11.799 --> 00:39:15.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cause us to break our integrity to our precious

00:39:15.669 --> 00:39:20.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
heavenly Father,
so this helps us to appreciate that,

00:39:20.007 --> 00:39:22.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though it was long before

00:39:22.076 --> 00:39:25.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the thoughts here in Revelation
and what Jesus taught us.

00:39:25.479 --> 00:39:28.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Proverbs chapter 4,
it still helps us:

00:39:28.816 --> 00:39:33.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“More than all else that is to be guarded,
safeguard your heart,

00:39:33.454 --> 00:39:37.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for out of it are the sources of life.”

00:39:37.558 --> 00:39:41.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So even back then,
there was the recognition

00:39:41.262 --> 00:39:45.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have to safeguard our heart
and accept the fact that our heart,

00:39:45.966 --> 00:39:48.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our figurative heart, is treacherous

00:39:48.436 --> 00:39:53.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’ll safeguard our precious relationship
with Jehovah God.

00:39:53.441 --> 00:39:57.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, to help us with that,
notice what Paul wrote

00:39:57.978 --> 00:40:02.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—very familiar verses in 2 Timothy chapter 3.

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:07.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ve used this
in the ministry many times,

00:40:07.655 --> 00:40:09.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet think about it as it connects

00:40:09.723 --> 00:40:12.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with safeguarding our hearts

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:15.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and accepting the fact that it’s treacherous

00:40:15.596 --> 00:40:19.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that we won’t break our integrity

00:40:19.366 --> 00:40:23.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or allow the Devil
to somehow cause us to break our integrity.

00:40:23.337 --> 00:40:28.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Timothy chapter 3
and you’ll notice what we’re emphasizing here.

00:40:28.342 --> 00:40:32.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact is in verse 16:
“All Scripture is inspired of God.”

00:40:32.913 --> 00:40:34.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But notice the benefits.

00:40:34.915 --> 00:40:38.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s “for teaching,” it’s “for reproving,”
“setting things straight”

00:40:38.652 --> 00:40:40.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—see the point here, though?—

00:40:40.654 --> 00:40:44.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for disciplining in righteousness.”

00:40:44.091 --> 00:40:46.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you think of that maybe on your Bible study.

00:40:46.894 --> 00:40:51.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I use the Bible to discipline
my Bible study to get God’s thinking.’

00:40:51.532 --> 00:40:56.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s appropriate that elders
use the Scriptures to discipline.

00:40:56.137 --> 00:40:59.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, we want to emphasize here for you

00:40:59.874 --> 00:41:04.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that when you’re doing your
personal Bible reading (many of us),

00:41:04.245 --> 00:41:08.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let the Scriptures discipline
that treacherous heart.

00:41:08.682 --> 00:41:10.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a mirror.

00:41:10.951 --> 00:41:15.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When something hits you
because maybe you’ve had wrong thinking

00:41:15.289 --> 00:41:19.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(could be all sorts of things,
anything that could lead us astray

00:41:19.627 --> 00:41:22.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cause us to break our integrity),
just face the fact.

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:24.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just between you and Jehovah.

00:41:24.732 --> 00:41:29.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re reading it,
and let it discipline you in righteousness.

00:41:29.737 --> 00:41:32.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what’s going
to enable us to protect

00:41:32.873 --> 00:41:36.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our precious relationship
with Jehovah God.

00:41:36.744 --> 00:41:39.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we all have to face that fact,
as we mentioned,

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:43.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our figurative heart is treacherous;
it’s a traitor.

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:47.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s wonderful is we’re confident
that Jehovah loves us.

00:41:47.488 --> 00:41:50.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when he made that estimation in Jeremiah,

00:41:50.291 --> 00:41:53.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s motivated by his love.

00:41:53.294 --> 00:41:57.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that helps us to protect
our relationship with him

00:41:57.231 --> 00:41:59.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—facing that fact.

00:41:59.233 --> 00:42:00.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the way it is.

00:42:00.834 --> 00:42:03.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So indeed, we accept the fact
about our figurative heart,

00:42:03.971 --> 00:42:07.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we’re determined
to protect and safeguard

00:42:07.775 --> 00:42:11.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our precious relationship with Jehovah God.

00:42:11.712 --> 00:42:14.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, praying for Jehovah’s help

00:42:14.315 --> 00:42:18.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is an important tool
in safeguarding our heart.

00:42:18.185 --> 00:42:22.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And having a desire
to protect our relationship with Jehovah

00:42:22.556 --> 00:42:27.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is closely linked to how much
we appreciate what he’s done for us.

00:42:28.629 --> 00:42:31.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our appreciation moves us to action

00:42:31.498 --> 00:42:34.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and strengthens our faith in him.

00:42:34.868 --> 00:42:38.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such appreciation
is highlighted in this month’s

00:42:38.205 --> 00:42:41.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
music video which is entitled Thankful.

00:42:53.621 --> 00:42:59.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dandelions growing
on top of the hill,

00:42:59.293 --> 00:43:04.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mountains in the distance,
wind blowing through the field,

00:43:04.265 --> 00:43:10.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Warmth of the sun
casting down from the sky,

00:43:10.004 --> 00:43:15.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Birds fly up above,
Clouds rolling by—

What did I do
To see such beauty?

00:43:20.648 --> 00:43:26.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what do I do
To show how much I care?

00:43:26.487 --> 00:43:32.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve got to be thankful,
Tell Jehovah in prayer

00:43:32.459 --> 00:43:38.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That I’m thankful
For the love that he shares.

00:43:38.065 --> 00:43:41.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stop, 
look around,

00:43:41.035 --> 00:43:45.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take a moment,
and let it sink down in my heart.

00:43:45.873 --> 00:43:51.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never take for granted
all he’s done.

00:43:51.078 --> 00:44:01.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve got to be thankful.
I’ve got to be thankful.

00:44:04.291 --> 00:44:09.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So many colors
now painted in the sky,

00:44:09.396 --> 00:44:15.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful canvas
you’ve laid before my eyes!

00:44:15.569 --> 00:44:20.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sound of the river
running into the night,

00:44:20.741 --> 00:44:25.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The stars are dancing
in the moon’s spotlight—

00:44:25.813 --> 00:44:31.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did I do
To see such beauty?

00:44:31.085 --> 00:44:37.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I know what to do
To show how much I care.

00:44:37.057 --> 00:44:42.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve got to be thankful,
Tell Jehovah in prayer

00:44:42.763 --> 00:44:48.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That I’m thankful
For the love that he shares.

00:44:48.635 --> 00:44:51.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stop,
look around,

00:44:51.638 --> 00:44:56.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take a moment,
and let it sink down in my heart.

00:44:56.176 --> 00:45:02.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never take for granted 
all he’s done.

00:45:02.082 --> 00:45:05.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve got to be thankful.

00:45:09.089 --> 00:45:12.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I see your wisdom
and your strength,

00:45:12.626 --> 00:45:19.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your goodness in ev’rything,
And how much you love.

00:45:19.099 --> 00:45:26.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m so thankful;
I’ve got to be thankful.

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:53.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve got to be thankful,
Tell Jehovah in prayer

00:45:53.534 --> 00:45:59.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That I’m thankful
For the love that he shares.

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:02.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stop,
look around,

00:46:02.042 --> 00:46:07.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take a moment,
and let it sink down in my heart.

00:46:07.314 --> 00:46:12.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never take for granted
all he’s done.

00:46:12.419 --> 00:46:23.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve got to be thankful.
I’ve got to be thankful.

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:29.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve got to be thankful.

00:46:40.347 --> 00:46:44.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice one way
of expressing our gratitude to Jehovah?

00:46:44.818 --> 00:46:47.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, by means of prayer.

00:46:47.654 --> 00:46:51.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having that channel
to the Sovereign of the universe

00:46:51.358 --> 00:46:55.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a benefit of being his people.

00:46:55.062 --> 00:46:58.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And speaking of being Jehovah’s people,

00:46:58.499 --> 00:47:00.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in last month’s program,

00:47:00.634 --> 00:47:04.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had an opportunity
to visit one of the museums

00:47:04.204 --> 00:47:07.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at world headquarters in Warwick, New York.

00:47:07.374 --> 00:47:09.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there’s more to see.

00:47:09.543 --> 00:47:14.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s join Brother John Ekrann,
a helper to the Coordinators’ Committee,

00:47:14.448 --> 00:47:17.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on another visit, and this time,

00:47:17.351 --> 00:47:22.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll stop by a museum called
“A People for Jehovah’s Name.”

00:47:27.594 --> 00:47:30.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you enjoy a good story?

00:47:30.097 --> 00:47:33.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, you’re in for a special treat.

00:47:33.267 --> 00:47:35.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A People for Jehovah’s Name”

00:47:35.469 --> 00:47:39.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at world headquarters in Warwick
is more than a history museum.

00:47:40.941 --> 00:47:44.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the modern-day story of a people
seeking to know the true God

00:47:44.778 --> 00:47:46.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to do his will.

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:48.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this isn’t just any story

00:47:48.882 --> 00:47:50.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it’s our story.

00:47:50.884 --> 00:47:53.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s take
a thrilling journey back in time.

00:47:55.656 --> 00:47:58.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The story unfolds on the narrative wall

00:47:58.025 --> 00:48:00.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in several galleries along the way.

00:48:01.862 --> 00:48:03.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We begin in the 1870’s,

00:48:03.864 --> 00:48:06.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when a small group
in Allegheny, Pennsylvania,

00:48:06.533 --> 00:48:09.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
decided to reexamine the Bible.

00:48:09.336 --> 00:48:12.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As C. T. Russell reasoned:

00:48:12.139 --> 00:48:14.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All the creeds of Christendom

00:48:14.308 --> 00:48:16.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
claim to be founded on the Bible;

00:48:16.310 --> 00:48:18.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and these are conflicting.

00:48:18.512 --> 00:48:22.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it possible that the Bible
has been misrepresented?

00:48:22.749 --> 00:48:26.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more they learned,
the more they wanted to share.

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:28.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in 1879,

00:48:28.522 --> 00:48:30.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they began publishing Zion’s Watch Tower.

00:48:32.359 --> 00:48:36.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Readers were soon taking a stand
for the truths that they were learning.

00:48:36.496 --> 00:48:38.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen.

00:48:38.231 --> 00:48:41.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What I want to tell you is this,

00:48:41.201 --> 00:48:43.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am free!

00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:46.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The truth has made me free!

00:48:46.239 --> 00:48:49.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To-day I was excluded
from the Baptist church . . .

00:48:49.876 --> 00:48:54.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I am all alone in the ‘flesh,’
but not in the ‘spirit.’

00:48:56.116 --> 00:48:58.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They became known as the Bible Students,

00:48:58.952 --> 00:49:02.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they soon realized that people
everywhere should hear the good news.

00:49:04.358 --> 00:49:08.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how could this small group
preach the Bible’s message earthwide?

00:49:10.097 --> 00:49:12.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Transcontinental and international tours

00:49:12.899 --> 00:49:15.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped them to see how they could expand

00:49:15.035 --> 00:49:17.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their preaching work even further.

00:49:17.704 --> 00:49:19.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In just one tour

00:49:19.706 --> 00:49:22.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beginning in December 1911,

00:49:22.209 --> 00:49:24.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
C. T. Russell and his associates

00:49:24.544 --> 00:49:27.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
traveled completely around the world.

00:49:27.547 --> 00:49:32.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s imagine what it was like
to live in those exciting times.

00:49:33.954 --> 00:49:37.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this gallery,
you can experience what life was like

00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:41.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a pilgrim,
or what we today call a circuit overseer.

00:49:41.728 --> 00:49:46.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s a pilgrim’s formal jacket
that he’d wear when giving a public talk.

00:49:47.668 --> 00:49:51.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible Students offered the Studies
in the Scriptures series in the ministry.

00:49:51.772 --> 00:49:54.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they carried lists to locate

00:49:54.608 --> 00:49:57.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and visit Watch Tower subscribers.

00:49:57.110 --> 00:49:59.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then in 1914,

00:49:59.813 --> 00:50:03.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they presented
the exciting “Photo-Drama of Creation.”

00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:07.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Its purpose was to build faith in the Bible

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:10.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as God’s inspired Word.

00:50:10.157 --> 00:50:13.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was an innovative combination

00:50:13.026 --> 00:50:15.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of moving pictures,

00:50:15.128 --> 00:50:17.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sound recordings,

00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:19.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and beautiful, hand-colored glass slides.

00:50:21.001 --> 00:50:24.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hundreds of people reenacted Bible scenes,

00:50:24.705 --> 00:50:27.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some with live animals!

00:50:27.674 --> 00:50:32.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was this enormous work worth all the effort?

00:50:32.512 --> 00:50:35.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL,
I want to thank you;

00:50:35.816 --> 00:50:38.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
oh, . . . so much, for the privilege

00:50:38.452 --> 00:50:41.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of seeing the PHOTO-DRAMA OF CREATION!

00:50:41.621 --> 00:50:44.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had never thought to live to see

00:50:44.024 --> 00:50:47.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the everlasting Gospel preached
to those who dwell on the earth . . . !

00:50:47.461 --> 00:50:49.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet so it is.

00:50:49.463 --> 00:50:53.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Words cannot tell you how my heart rejoices!

00:50:53.033 --> 00:50:56.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Your sister, F. E. Riley.

00:50:56.203 --> 00:51:00.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the end of 1914,
over nine million had viewed it.

00:51:02.008 --> 00:51:04.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with such success,

00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:08.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible Students didn’t realize
what tests lay ahead.

00:51:14.221 --> 00:51:16.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Gentile Times have ended;

00:51:16.923 --> 00:51:20.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their kings have had their day!

00:51:20.327 --> 00:51:23.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we know not what awaits us.

00:51:26.867 --> 00:51:29.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
World War I broke out in 1914.

00:51:29.369 --> 00:51:31.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then in 1916,

00:51:31.204 --> 00:51:35.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the death of C. T. Russell
left the Bible Students in shock.

00:51:35.709 --> 00:51:38.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a unique time of testing.

00:51:39.946 --> 00:51:41.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Inside the organization,

00:51:41.948 --> 00:51:44.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some struggled over who should take the lead.

00:51:44.618 --> 00:51:46.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Outside,

00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:50.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
governments tried to force them
to take sides in the war.

00:51:51.258 --> 00:51:53.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then in 1918,

00:51:53.393 --> 00:51:56.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
J. F. Rutherford
and seven of his close associates

00:51:56.696 --> 00:51:58.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were imprisoned.

00:51:58.698 --> 00:52:02.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was this the end for the Bible Students?

00:52:02.202 --> 00:52:04.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or would they prove to be

00:52:04.271 --> 00:52:07.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a people for Jehovah’s name?

00:52:07.207 --> 00:52:10.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The joy that came
with the release of our brothers

00:52:10.911 --> 00:52:13.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the Atlanta Federal Prison on Tuesday,

00:52:13.413 --> 00:52:18.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
March 25, 1919, knew no bounds.

00:52:18.151 --> 00:52:22.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their further devotion to Jehovah
was shown in the fact

00:52:22.289 --> 00:52:24.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they immediately set to work to herald

00:52:24.624 --> 00:52:27.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
forth to the people of God everywhere

00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:29.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the knowledge of Jehovah’s deliverance.

00:52:29.830 --> 00:52:31.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Thomas Sullivan.

00:52:31.898 --> 00:52:36.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible Students
moved forward with renewed zeal.

00:52:36.102 --> 00:52:39.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the opposition didn’t end there.

00:52:41.975 --> 00:52:45.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this gallery,
you will see how our brothers and sisters

00:52:45.278 --> 00:52:47.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have stood firm for their faith.

00:52:48.849 --> 00:52:52.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Russia, a father imprisoned for ten years

00:52:52.118 --> 00:52:54.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
encouraged his young daughters

00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:56.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with hand-drawn postcards.

00:52:56.923 --> 00:52:59.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Greece,

00:52:59.125 --> 00:53:01.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a son used the same blanket in prison

00:53:01.928 --> 00:53:05.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his father used
when imprisoned before him.

00:53:05.365 --> 00:53:09.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was an encouraging reminder
of his father’s integrity.

00:53:09.169 --> 00:53:11.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Korea,

00:53:11.204 --> 00:53:13.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Witnesses were locked in tiny cells

00:53:13.273 --> 00:53:17.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for up to 30 days at a time.

00:53:17.777 --> 00:53:22.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you stand in the lighted outline,
you get a sense of what it was like.

00:53:24.384 --> 00:53:27.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of these brothers and sisters
looked beyond the prison bars

00:53:27.787 --> 00:53:30.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to their firm hope for the future.

00:53:32.726 --> 00:53:34.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As light from God’s Word increased,

00:53:34.861 --> 00:53:36.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible Students humbly let go

00:53:36.863 --> 00:53:41.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of cherished but unscriptural traditions.

00:53:41.067 --> 00:53:45.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Songs used in worship were examined
in the light of what the Bible taught.

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:50.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people for Jehovah’s name
were becoming even more evident.

00:53:50.343 --> 00:53:51.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in 1931,

00:53:51.978 --> 00:53:55.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were thrilled to take on their new name

00:53:55.649 --> 00:53:57.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:53:59.352 --> 00:54:01.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then in 1935,

00:54:01.354 --> 00:54:04.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Rutherford identified
the great multitude of other sheep,

00:54:04.991 --> 00:54:07.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who served alongside the anointed.

00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:11.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the climax of his talk, he asked:

00:54:11.264 --> 00:54:15.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will all those who have the hope
of living forever on the earth please stand?

00:54:16.903 --> 00:54:18.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With this new understanding,

00:54:18.905 --> 00:54:23.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they saw the true scope
of Jesus’ commission to make disciples.

00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:26.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
New and innovative methods were needed.

00:54:28.715 --> 00:54:33.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our third gallery shows the preaching
methods used in the 1930’s and 1940’s.

00:54:35.021 --> 00:54:38.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Radio was a powerful way
to spread the Kingdom message

00:54:38.625 --> 00:54:40.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to large audiences.

00:54:41.895 --> 00:54:44.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They also used large phonographs,

00:54:44.431 --> 00:54:47.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
called portable transcription machines,

00:54:47.267 --> 00:54:50.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with loudspeakers mounted on sound cars.

00:54:51.705 --> 00:54:54.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers played recorded talks
wherever people gathered.

00:54:55.942 --> 00:55:00.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lighter phonographs
were also designed and produced so publishers

00:55:00.647 --> 00:55:04.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could take the recorded message
directly to people at home.

00:55:04.551 --> 00:55:08.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These methods 
helped bring unity to the message,

00:55:08.555 --> 00:55:12.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the time had come to train each one

00:55:12.258 --> 00:55:15.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s people
to be an effective Witness.

00:55:15.962 --> 00:55:17.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Schools were started.

00:55:17.964 --> 00:55:19.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Course in Theocratic Ministry

00:55:19.599 --> 00:55:22.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trained publishers in the congregation.

00:55:22.335 --> 00:55:24.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Bible School of Gilead

00:55:24.838 --> 00:55:28.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
began training missionaries
for global expansion.

00:55:28.908 --> 00:55:34.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had entered
into a new era of divine education.

00:55:35.015 --> 00:55:38.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we were about to receive an amazing tool.

00:55:39.686 --> 00:55:41.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1950,

00:55:41.688 --> 00:55:45.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we received the New World Translation
of the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:55:45.291 --> 00:55:49.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And by 1961, the complete Bible was released.

00:55:49.929 --> 00:55:53.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since then,
we’ve seen our tools continue to improve

00:55:53.133 --> 00:55:55.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the wise use of modern technology.

00:55:56.636 --> 00:55:59.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From high-speed printing
to the Internet and video,

00:55:59.606 --> 00:56:02.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these methods help us to stay unified,

00:56:02.642 --> 00:56:04.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach millions with the good news,

00:56:04.644 --> 00:56:07.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to glorify God.

00:56:07.113 --> 00:56:10.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, this museum’s story is about people,

00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:12.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but not just any people.

00:56:12.385 --> 00:56:15.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are “a people for Jehovah’s name.”

00:56:15.822 --> 00:56:17.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only one question remains:

00:56:17.957 --> 00:56:21.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will you contribute
to this wonderful story?

00:56:23.029 --> 00:56:25.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This month, after discussing the theme

00:56:25.532 --> 00:56:28.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Cherish Your Privilege of Prayer,”

00:56:28.001 --> 00:56:30.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we saw how we should act

00:56:30.003 --> 00:56:33.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we encounter spiritism.

00:56:33.206 --> 00:56:36.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When counteracting wicked spirits,

00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:39.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
praying for Jehovah’s guidance
is very important.

00:56:40.914 --> 00:56:44.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, Brother Morris
showed us the importance of praying

00:56:44.584 --> 00:56:46.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to protect our heart.

00:56:46.619 --> 00:56:48.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the music video

00:56:48.621 --> 00:56:52.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reminded us
of not forgetting to thank Jehovah

00:56:52.592 --> 00:56:54.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for everything he’s given us.

00:56:56.129 --> 00:56:58.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The provision of communicating with Jehovah

00:56:58.698 --> 00:57:02.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a privilege we have of being his people.

00:57:02.569 --> 00:57:05.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A visit to Warwick Bethel
showed us how Jehovah

00:57:05.672 --> 00:57:09.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has guided his people in modern times.

00:57:09.509 --> 00:57:11.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before we conclude,

00:57:11.544 --> 00:57:13.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll visit the remote translation office

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:17.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Chinle, Arizona, in the United States.

00:57:17.484 --> 00:57:21.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Located
in the southwestern part of the country,

00:57:21.221 --> 00:57:23.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the region is home

00:57:23.223 --> 00:57:26.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to many native peoples and tribes.

00:57:26.426 --> 00:57:30.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
European settlers arrived in the 1500’s.

00:57:30.797 --> 00:57:33.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout the many years since then,

00:57:33.266 --> 00:57:35.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many of the tribes were able

00:57:35.268 --> 00:57:38.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to retain their culture and language.

00:57:39.606 --> 00:57:42.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Currently,
the United States branch translates

00:57:42.308 --> 00:57:46.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into several indigenous languages, including

00:57:46.279 --> 00:57:50.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cherokee, Hopi, Lakota, and Navajo.

00:57:50.850 --> 00:57:52.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To help with that work,

00:57:52.986 --> 00:57:57.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 2015, a remote translation office, or RTO,

00:57:57.857 --> 00:57:59.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was built in Chinle,

00:57:59.893 --> 00:58:02.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is in the heart of the Navajo nation.

00:58:02.896 --> 00:58:05.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over 100 volunteers,

00:58:05.899 --> 00:58:08.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of which 13 are full-time servants,

00:58:08.902 --> 00:58:10.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
work at the RTO.

00:58:11.905 --> 00:58:16.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Navajo field has over 430 publishers,

00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:20.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including approximately 130 regular pioneers

00:58:20.346 --> 00:58:23.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some 20 special pioneers.

00:58:23.449 --> 00:58:25.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The literature, videos,

00:58:25.818 --> 00:58:28.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and audio publications translated

00:58:28.288 --> 00:58:30.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the RTO

00:58:30.290 --> 00:58:33.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are distributed to 8 Navajo congregations,

00:58:33.259 --> 00:58:38.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
11 groups, and 5 pregroups.

00:58:38.164 --> 00:58:41.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the past five years,
three-day regional conventions

00:58:41.634 --> 00:58:43.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been held in the Navajo language.

00:58:45.038 --> 00:58:49.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2018, they had a peak attendance of 471,

00:58:49.042 --> 00:58:52.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with one baptized.

00:58:52.045 --> 00:58:54.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The volunteers at the RTO in Chinle

00:58:54.581 --> 00:58:59.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
send their warm Christian love
to all of us around the world.

00:58:59.118 --> 00:59:02.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we love them dearly.

00:59:02.288 --> 00:59:04.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is JW Broadcasting

00:59:04.591 --> 00:59:08.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
