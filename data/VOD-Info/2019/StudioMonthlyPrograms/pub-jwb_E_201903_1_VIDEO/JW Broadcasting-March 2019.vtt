Welcome!

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are some highlights from the program:

00:00:06.356 --> 00:00:11.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How should we act
when our Christian neutrality is put to the test?

00:00:12.362 --> 00:00:15.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know where 
to draw the line between being

00:00:15.198 --> 00:00:18.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a respectful observer
and an active participant?

00:00:19.736 --> 00:00:22.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Join this family as these questions come up.

00:00:22.672 --> 00:00:27.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re confronted
by the neutrality issue in all aspects of life.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What Bible principle should guide our thinking?

00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:34.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This month’s music video focuses

00:00:34.517 --> 00:00:37.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the unity among our brothers and sisters.

00:00:37.487 --> 00:00:39.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the world becomes more divided,

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we become more united!

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:48.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the March 2019 program 
of JW Broadcasting!

00:01:07.917 --> 00:01:11.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We begin by traveling to the country of Armenia,

00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:13.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is located in the Caucasus

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a region situated
at the border of Europe and Asia.

00:01:18.228 --> 00:01:20.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite facing persecution for many years,

00:01:20.964 --> 00:01:23.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers and sisters in Armenia

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:25.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have remained loyal to Jehovah.

00:01:25.902 --> 00:01:29.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The story of Armenia

00:01:29.105 --> 00:01:31.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a story of faith

00:01:32.642 --> 00:01:35.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the faith
of courageous brothers and sisters

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:38.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who endured mob violence,

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:40.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
protests, and threats

00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:42.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from those who do not know God;

00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:48.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the faith of young brothers
who were imprisoned

00:01:48.992 --> 00:01:52.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they refused
to compromise their neutrality;

00:01:52.395 --> 00:01:55.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the faith of lawyers

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who defended them
when they were arrested.

00:01:59.702 --> 00:02:01.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the early part of this period,

00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:06.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the work operated out of an office
in a local brother’s home.

00:02:07.243 --> 00:02:11.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, the story is much different.

00:02:11.147 --> 00:02:13.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On May 14, 2016,

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers in Armenia
were delighted to dedicate a group

00:02:17.187 --> 00:02:20.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of new facilities
to accommodate future growth

00:02:20.824 --> 00:02:24.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a branch facility

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(mainly located on six floors
of a local building),

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:32.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a new Assembly Hall,

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:39.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also a school facility.

00:02:39.175 --> 00:02:42.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The dedication week
started off with a welcome night,

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:46.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where many
traveled long distances to attend,

00:02:46.282 --> 00:02:49.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some had not seen
each other for a long time.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’ve never been
to Armenia before,

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:55.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meeting the brothers
and sisters was such an experience.

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They gave us a really warm welcome.

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:02.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 90,

00:03:02.031 --> 00:03:04.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I decided, “No more Armenia.”

00:03:04.968 --> 00:03:08.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now I’m 96, and Jehovah said,

00:03:08.304 --> 00:03:10.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You’re going to Armenia.”

00:03:10.306 --> 00:03:12.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a blessing!

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:17.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was amazing to see so many brothers
and sisters from different countries,

00:03:17.881 --> 00:03:21.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we enjoyed a very,
very nice time with them.

00:03:21.484 --> 00:03:23.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to Jehovah, we really enjoyed this.

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:29.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the spiritual gems
that we all enjoyed the most

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:33.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were during the dedication program
held at the end of the week.

00:03:35.598 --> 00:03:38.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The program was filled
with reports and interviews

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:41.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that touched our hearts,

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Brother Splane of the Governing Body
gave the dedication talk.

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:48.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it your desire to dedicate

00:03:48.912 --> 00:03:52.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the branch facilities, the Assembly Hall,

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the school facility to Jehovah today?

00:04:01.925 --> 00:04:04.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could never have imagined
such a thing happening five years ago.

00:04:04.761 --> 00:04:07.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the time
that we arrived at the airport

00:04:07.297 --> 00:04:09.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we saw
the brothers boldly holding up

00:04:09.866 --> 00:04:12.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the jw.org sign with their badges,

00:04:12.702 --> 00:04:16.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were just so overwhelmed
—so moved.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:19.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I could feel as if
I’m in the Paradise today

00:04:19.976 --> 00:04:23.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we have so many guests
from different countries,

00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:25.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I could see their happy faces.

00:04:25.782 --> 00:04:28.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For many years, to be in courts

00:04:28.885 --> 00:04:32.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in legal battles for our brothers
as conscientious objectors

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to go to the court

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:39.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for fighting a case
for just one Kingdom Hall—

00:04:39.562 --> 00:04:42.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and suddenly to have a branch

00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:44.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Assembly Hall
and school facilities right away,

00:04:44.867 --> 00:04:47.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s for me kind of unbelievable.

00:04:47.637 --> 00:04:50.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today is a great day

00:04:50.306 --> 00:04:53.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Jehovah’s people in Armenia.

00:04:58.247 --> 00:05:01.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Truly, Jehovah has seen

00:05:01.351 --> 00:05:05.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the faithful obedience
of our brothers and sisters in Armenia.

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:08.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have witnessed Jehovah
‘open the floodgates of the heavens

00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:11.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and actually empty out a blessing

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until there is no more want.’

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.165 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Our theme this month is

00:05:16.165 --> 00:05:18.167 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Christian Neutrality

00:05:18.167 --> 00:05:21.070 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“—What It Means, What It Takes,

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.539 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and Why We Choose It.”

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:25.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is your opinion?

00:05:25.708 --> 00:05:27.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where do you stand?

00:05:27.877 --> 00:05:32.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can one person
make a difference in countering injustice?

00:05:32.648 --> 00:05:35.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we hear people
discussing political topics,

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:39.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we might at first think
their conversation is purely philosophical;

00:05:39.522 --> 00:05:42.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but when injustice threatens our loved ones,

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:45.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it can seem personal.

00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:49.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We expect that people
will be divided over political ideology.

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:53.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation chapters 8-13 
foretold that in the last days,

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:58.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
government would be
the burning issue among mankind

00:05:58.007 --> 00:06:02.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that people
would feel pressured to take sides.

00:06:02.412 --> 00:06:05.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The question each of us
needs to ask himself is,

00:06:05.748 --> 00:06:10.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do I respond when people
debate solutions to serious injustices?

00:06:11.687 --> 00:06:14.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Christians,
we’re most interested

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:17.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the example of Christ.

00:06:17.527 --> 00:06:20.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If ever there was a person who could make
a difference in countering injustice,

00:06:20.997 --> 00:06:22.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was Jesus.

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:25.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He felt deep compassion for people.

00:06:25.935 --> 00:06:28.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with his abilities to feed the hungry,

00:06:28.871 --> 00:06:33.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
heal the sick, raise the dead,
and reach hearts with his winsome words,

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:38.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus could have exerted
invincible influence in the realm of politics.

00:06:38.581 --> 00:06:41.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He certainly had the opportunity to do so.

00:06:41.517 --> 00:06:43.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan was pleased to offer him

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:45.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth”

00:06:45.521 --> 00:06:48.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in an exchange for one act of worship.

00:06:48.391 --> 00:06:50.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jesus wouldn’t accept it.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neither did he assert that Satan
had no authority to make such an offer.

00:06:55.398 --> 00:06:59.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, Jesus’ own countrymen
tried to make him king,

00:06:59.135 --> 00:07:01.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he rejected that too.

00:07:01.437 --> 00:07:03.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later still, someone asked him

00:07:03.973 --> 00:07:07.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether it was lawful
to pay taxes to the Roman government.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, Jesus didn’t take sides.

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:14.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He refused to become a world ruler,

00:07:14.117 --> 00:07:17.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a national leader, or a political activist.

00:07:18.354 --> 00:07:22.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did that mean that Jesus didn’t care?
that he had no opinion?

00:07:22.925 --> 00:07:24.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To the contrary!

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus cared more deeply than we can fathom.

00:07:27.463 --> 00:07:29.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And by treating people fairly,

00:07:29.465 --> 00:07:33.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus promoted justice
at the most fundamental level.

00:07:33.803 --> 00:07:36.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, his principal focus

00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:39.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was on teaching people
about the Kingdom of God,

00:07:39.342 --> 00:07:42.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which would eliminate injustice for all time.

00:07:42.678 --> 00:07:46.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what did Jesus
indicate should be our position

00:07:46.782 --> 00:07:49.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding human governments?

00:07:49.051 --> 00:07:53.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learn from Jesus’ response
to the question about Roman taxation

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:58.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded at Mark 12:15-17:

00:07:59.829 --> 00:08:02.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Bring me a denarius to look at.’

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:05.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They brought one, and he said to them:

00:08:05.501 --> 00:08:08.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Whose image and inscription is this?’

00:08:08.471 --> 00:08:10.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They said to him: ‘Caesar’s.’

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jesus then said:

00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:16.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Pay back Caesar’s things to Caesar,

00:08:16.012 --> 00:08:19.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but God’s things to God.’”

00:08:19.682 --> 00:08:22.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are Caesar’s things?

00:08:22.552 --> 00:08:26.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Romans 13:1-7,

00:08:26.022 --> 00:08:29.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the apostle Paul lists tax, tribute,

00:08:29.492 --> 00:08:32.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fear, and honor.

00:08:32.528 --> 00:08:37.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice, too, that Jesus said
to “pay back Caesar’s things.”

00:08:37.533 --> 00:08:39.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that imply?

00:08:39.535 --> 00:08:41.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That Caesar, 
the ruling authority of the day,

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:45.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had issued valuable things
—coins, for example.

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:50.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thus, Caesar had the right
to ask for some of those coins back.

00:08:50.813 --> 00:08:54.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This enabled the State
to continue rendering necessary services.

00:08:54.884 --> 00:08:56.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus acknowledged that.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand,

00:08:59.689 --> 00:09:03.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our most valuable possessions
are grants from God himself

00:09:03.259 --> 00:09:08.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—such gifts as our heart,
our life, our mind, and our strength.

00:09:08.264 --> 00:09:11.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can’t give those things back to Caesar

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Caesar
didn’t grant them to us in the first place.

00:09:13.936 --> 00:09:17.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We rightly give those things back to God

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the form of our dedication and our love.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:26.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regarding our love for God,
Jesus said at Mark 12:30:

00:09:27.717 --> 00:09:30.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You must love Jehovah your God

00:09:30.753 --> 00:09:34.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with your whole heart
and with your whole soul

00:09:34.523 --> 00:09:36.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and with your whole mind

00:09:36.892 --> 00:09:40.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with your whole strength.”

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:44.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the love we give back to God is total

00:09:44.133 --> 00:09:46.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no bodily part, function,

00:09:46.435 --> 00:09:49.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
capacity, or desire being left out.

00:09:49.739 --> 00:09:54.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who love God take the side of Jesus,

00:09:54.677 --> 00:09:58.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whom Jehovah has appointed as King.

00:09:58.247 --> 00:10:02.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how would Jesus’ disciples
defend his Kingdom when people opposed it?

00:10:03.753 --> 00:10:06.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We gain insight from events that occurred

00:10:06.489 --> 00:10:09.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the last night of Jesus’ life on earth.

00:10:09.425 --> 00:10:12.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recall from Matthew chapter 26

00:10:12.261 --> 00:10:16.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that when “a large crowd
with swords and clubs” came to arrest Jesus,

00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:21.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter “drew his sword and struck
the slave of the high priest, taking off his ear.”

00:10:22.605 --> 00:10:26.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John reports that the slave’s name was Malchus.

00:10:26.175 --> 00:10:30.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Luke adds that Jesus touched
the man’s ear and healed him.

00:10:30.713 --> 00:10:32.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine that!

00:10:32.181 --> 00:10:36.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus bore no ill will
toward the men taking him into custody.

00:10:36.819 --> 00:10:40.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Further, according to Matthew 26:52,

00:10:40.623 --> 00:10:42.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus told Peter:

00:10:42.024 --> 00:10:45.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Return your sword to its place,

00:10:45.261 --> 00:10:47.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for all those who take up the sword

00:10:47.797 --> 00:10:50.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will perish by the sword.”

00:10:51.334 --> 00:10:55.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did Jesus disapprove of Peter’s brave act?

00:10:55.104 --> 00:10:59.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the same reason that he had avoided
the political process all the way up to that point.

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:05.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus explained this when he appeared
before Pontius Pilate later that night.

00:11:05.715 --> 00:11:10.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At John 18:36, we read:

00:11:10.686 --> 00:11:15.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My Kingdom is no part of this world.”

00:11:15.891 --> 00:11:19.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, because Jesus’ Kingdom
is not of human origin,

00:11:19.729 --> 00:11:22.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it doesn’t need human defenses.

00:11:22.832 --> 00:11:26.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we be sure
that this is what Jesus meant?

00:11:26.302 --> 00:11:29.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look closely at the rest of John 18:36:

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:34.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If my Kingdom were part of this world,

00:11:34.076 --> 00:11:36.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“my attendants would have fought

00:11:36.345 --> 00:11:38.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that I should not be handed over to the Jews.

00:11:38.681 --> 00:11:41.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But as it is, my Kingdom

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:44.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not from this source.”

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:46.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as Christians,

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:51.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what is our position
where political matters are concerned?

00:11:51.427 --> 00:11:53.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are neutral.

00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:57.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes people
misunderstand this viewpoint.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some have concluded that because we
don’t promote one human government,

00:12:01.404 --> 00:12:04.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we must be promoting
another human government.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the 1950’s,
in what is now the Republic of Congo,

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:12.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
authorities falsely accused
Jehovah’s Witnesses of being Communists.

00:12:12.548 --> 00:12:14.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But during the 1970’s,

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:17.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Congo adopted
a Communist form of government,

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:22.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the new authorities found fault
with us for not being Communists!

00:12:22.057 --> 00:12:24.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, however, and for nearly three decades,

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:28.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses have enjoyed
legal status in the Republic of Congo.

00:12:28.964 --> 00:12:31.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And whereas some have perceived

00:12:31.367 --> 00:12:34.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our Christian neutrality as sheer apathy,

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:38.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
others construe our position as a threat.

00:12:38.374 --> 00:12:41.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s address both of these viewpoints.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:44.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, there is a big difference

00:12:44.113 --> 00:12:47.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between Christian neutrality and apathy.

00:12:47.349 --> 00:12:49.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Apathy is defined

00:12:49.351 --> 00:12:52.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “a lack of interest, enthusiasm, or concern.”

00:12:52.988 --> 00:12:55.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We certainly don’t lack interest in people,

00:12:55.257 --> 00:12:57.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor are we insensitive to their feelings.

00:12:57.693 --> 00:13:00.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Jesus,
we strive to alleviate people’s suffering

00:13:00.963 --> 00:13:03.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by helping them in practical ways

00:13:03.132 --> 00:13:05.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while teaching them about the only Kingdom

00:13:05.968 --> 00:13:08.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can eliminate injustice.

00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:10.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By teaching people from God’s Word,

00:13:10.706 --> 00:13:12.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we endeavor to change hearts,

00:13:12.775 --> 00:13:15.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not political institutions.

00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:17.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We feel this approach is realistic

00:13:17.279 --> 00:13:21.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because mankind’s main problems
are not political

00:13:21.484 --> 00:13:24.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but moral.

00:13:24.053 --> 00:13:27.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why can it be said
that Jehovah’s Witnesses are not a threat

00:13:27.857 --> 00:13:30.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, rather, an asset?

00:13:30.025 --> 00:13:32.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We conscientiously obey the laws,

00:13:32.962 --> 00:13:35.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we support our communities
through volunteer service

00:13:35.865 --> 00:13:39.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or compulsory civilian service where that exists,

00:13:39.702 --> 00:13:41.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we pay our taxes.

00:13:41.837 --> 00:13:46.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true, we don’t vote
for political parties or candidates,

00:13:46.008 --> 00:13:48.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but neither do we disrupt elections

00:13:48.077 --> 00:13:50.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or interfere with those who choose to vote.

00:13:50.546 --> 00:13:54.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true, we don’t lobby,
campaign, or run for government office,

00:13:54.817 --> 00:13:57.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but neither do we criticize those in power,

00:13:57.386 --> 00:14:01.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
undermine their policies,
or demonstrate for political change.

00:14:01.857 --> 00:14:04.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true, we won’t salute a flag,

00:14:04.426 --> 00:14:07.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but neither will we burn a flag, spit on a flag,

00:14:07.296 --> 00:14:10.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or disparage the nation that a flag represents

00:14:10.499 --> 00:14:13.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even in lands where these are considered

00:14:13.002 --> 00:14:16.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
protected expressions of freedom.

00:14:16.505 --> 00:14:19.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true,
we don’t sing national anthems,

00:14:19.475 --> 00:14:21.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but neither do we discourage
others from singing,

00:14:21.977 --> 00:14:25.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor do we make
a public spectacle of not singing;

00:14:25.047 --> 00:14:28.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we simply don’t participate.

00:14:28.417 --> 00:14:31.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true, we wouldn’t kill people in war,

00:14:31.086 --> 00:14:34.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but neither would we attack people at home.

00:14:34.023 --> 00:14:37.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So while we don’t promote any political position,

00:14:37.192 --> 00:14:41.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
neither do we condemn any political position
—even in our heart.

00:14:41.463 --> 00:14:45.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is what neutrality means.

00:14:45.568 --> 00:14:48.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t take sides.

00:14:48.237 --> 00:14:51.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if the demands of the State

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:55.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
conflict with the commands of Jesus?

00:14:55.477 --> 00:14:58.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a Bible principle for that.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:02.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you thinking 
of what it says at Acts 5:28, 29

00:15:02.885 --> 00:15:07.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that “we must obey God
as ruler rather than men”?

00:15:07.356 --> 00:15:10.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is not disregard for the State,

00:15:10.292 --> 00:15:13.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, rather, reverence for God.

00:15:13.062 --> 00:15:16.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the State demands
that we do what God forbids

00:15:16.632 --> 00:15:19.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or refrain from doing what God commands,

00:15:19.668 --> 00:15:23.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we believe God
would consider that an invalid request.

00:15:25.107 --> 00:15:27.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, one might say,

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:32.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I can imagine some situations
where that viewpoint could get you into trouble.’

00:15:32.715 --> 00:15:36.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus foretold as much at Matthew 24:9,

00:15:36.585 --> 00:15:40.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he said:
“You will be hated by all the nations

00:15:40.723 --> 00:15:43.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on account of my name.”

00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:45.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More specifically, at Revelation 2:10,

00:15:45.961 --> 00:15:50.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said that some of his disciples
would be thrown into prison

00:15:50.733 --> 00:15:53.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not all of us but some.

00:15:53.602 --> 00:15:57.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re not disappointed
if we don’t get thrown into prison,

00:15:57.006 --> 00:16:00.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but neither are we discouraged if we do.

00:16:00.275 --> 00:16:03.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our minds turn
to the thousands of brothers and sisters

00:16:03.812 --> 00:16:05.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have been sentenced
to prison over the years

00:16:05.814 --> 00:16:08.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for their Christian neutrality.

00:16:08.283 --> 00:16:11.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are proud of them.
We pray for them.

00:16:11.587 --> 00:16:14.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that Jehovah is pleased with them.

00:16:15.491 --> 00:16:19.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their endurance under trial
spells victory for all of us.

00:16:19.895 --> 00:16:21.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?

00:16:21.964 --> 00:16:25.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To the congregation in Ephesus, Paul wrote:

00:16:27.036 --> 00:16:31.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I ask you not to give up
on account of my tribulations in your behalf,

00:16:31.874 --> 00:16:36.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for these mean glory for you.”

00:16:36.378 --> 00:16:41.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul wrote these words while he himself
was under house arrest in Rome.

00:16:41.183 --> 00:16:44.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In what sense did Paul’s tribulations

00:16:44.253 --> 00:16:47.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“mean glory” for the Ephesians?

00:16:47.156 --> 00:16:50.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In that his perseverance
in ministering despite trials

00:16:50.793 --> 00:16:54.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showed the congregation
that the privileges they enjoyed as Christians

00:16:54.463 --> 00:16:56.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were of the highest importance.

00:16:56.732 --> 00:17:01.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Paul had just given up,
what would that have implied?

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That their faith, their ministry,

00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:07.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their hope in God’s Kingdom
were not so valuable after all.

00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:11.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead,
Paul’s endurance exalted Christianity.

00:17:11.046 --> 00:17:16.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It demonstrated
that remaining faithful is worth any sacrifice.

00:17:16.051 --> 00:17:20.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In like manner, the endurance
of our dear brothers and sisters in prison

00:17:20.355 --> 00:17:22.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
proves that their hope is alive

00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:26.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that the Kingdom they represent is real.

00:17:26.628 --> 00:17:30.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have an identity as envoys,

00:17:30.466 --> 00:17:32.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not of any human government,

00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:34.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but of the heavenly Kingdom

00:17:34.336 --> 00:17:38.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a Kingdom
that will reward them with everlasting life

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a world without war.

00:17:42.177 --> 00:17:45.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether we face imprisonment or not,

00:17:45.013 --> 00:17:49.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how prepared are we
to remain neutral in our day-to-day life?

00:17:49.985 --> 00:17:53.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this dramatization, a Christian family discovers

00:17:53.489 --> 00:17:58.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they need to spend more time
studying about the subject of neutrality.

00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:01.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Collette, I’m home.

00:18:01.163 --> 00:18:03.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the kitchen, Curtis.

00:18:03.632 --> 00:18:05.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How was your day?

00:18:05.634 --> 00:18:07.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, it was a long day, but it’s nice being home.

00:18:07.503 --> 00:18:09.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That smells amazing! I can’t wait.

00:18:09.271 --> 00:18:10.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, well, it will be ready in a few minutes.

00:18:10.939 --> 00:18:12.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I have a surprise;

00:18:12.407 --> 00:18:16.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my job gave us tickets
to the game this weekend

00:18:16.311 --> 00:18:18.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—enough for all of us to go.

00:18:18.013 --> 00:18:19.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s downtown at the . . .

00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:21.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That sounded like fun.

00:18:21.316 --> 00:18:23.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a sport we could enjoy watching.

00:18:23.719 --> 00:18:25.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Collette and I hadn’t been in years,

00:18:25.754 --> 00:18:28.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I don’t think the kids had ever gone.

00:18:33.695 --> 00:18:36.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were all looking forward
to a family night out.

00:18:40.169 --> 00:18:44.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, Dad, what exactly do we do
during the national anthem?

00:18:46.308 --> 00:18:48.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Honestly, I wasn’t sure.

00:18:48.944 --> 00:18:50.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:18:50.179 --> 00:18:52.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would you please stand
for the singing

00:18:52.514 --> 00:18:55.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our national anthem?

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:03.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dad, I have a question too.

00:19:05.194 --> 00:19:07.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will they salute the flag at my new school?

00:19:07.629 --> 00:19:09.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right.

00:19:09.698 --> 00:19:12.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The conference
with her teachers was next week,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we didn’t know what they’d do there.

00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:15.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, class.
Now that everyone is here,

00:19:15.504 --> 00:19:18.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s all stand
for the pledge of allegiance.

00:19:21.577 --> 00:19:23.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elizabeth, is everything all right?

00:19:25.714 --> 00:19:27.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think, Honey?

00:19:29.852 --> 00:19:33.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, tomorrow night
is our Family Worship evening.

00:19:33.689 --> 00:19:36.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why don’t we do
a study project as a family

00:19:36.425 --> 00:19:39.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Christian neutrality at public events?

00:19:39.194 --> 00:19:40.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That sounds like a good idea.

00:19:40.829 --> 00:19:41.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think this will be great.
We’ll all get a chance to do our research.

00:19:47.069 --> 00:19:50.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked Daniel to research
Christian principles on neutrality.

00:19:52.875 --> 00:19:55.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Collette and Elizabeth would find examples

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:58.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of ones who proved loyal under pressure.

00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:02.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for me,

00:20:02.551 --> 00:20:04.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my job was to call Elizabeth’s new school

00:20:04.853 --> 00:20:07.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find out if they saluted
the flag or sang the anthem.

00:20:09.191 --> 00:20:10.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello.

00:20:10.225 --> 00:20:13.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi, Mr. Johnson?
This is Curtis, Elizabeth’s dad.

00:20:15.197 --> 00:20:18.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’d studied this topic
when the kids were younger,

00:20:18.267 --> 00:20:20.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we needed reminders
for these new challenges.

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:24.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The kids found some great information.

00:20:26.308 --> 00:20:28.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Several Bible principles applied.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:31.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what Jesus said at Matthew 4:10

00:20:31.313 --> 00:20:33.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was an essential foundation:

00:20:34.883 --> 00:20:37.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is Jehovah your God you must worship,

00:20:37.586 --> 00:20:42.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it is to him alone
you must render sacred service.”

00:20:42.291 --> 00:20:46.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we participate in a nationalistic ceremony,

00:20:46.128 --> 00:20:47.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re sharing in worship

00:20:47.996 --> 00:20:51.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of something or someone
other than Jehovah God.

00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:54.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what would help us know what to do?

00:20:55.671 --> 00:20:59.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elizabeth found
some good examples to imitate.

00:20:59.141 --> 00:21:01.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The account of Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:04.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was one of our favorites.

00:21:04.179 --> 00:21:07.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When King Nebuchadnezzar
ordered them to worship the gold image,

00:21:07.849 --> 00:21:11.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they bravely stood
while others bowed down.

00:21:11.954 --> 00:21:16.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were determined
to worship only Jehovah,

00:21:16.091 --> 00:21:19.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and He rescued them from the furnace.

00:21:19.161 --> 00:21:21.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there are modern-day examples

00:21:21.496 --> 00:21:23.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of courage like the three Hebrews.

00:21:23.865 --> 00:21:26.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some children have had to take a stand

00:21:26.435 --> 00:21:28.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when governments tried to force them

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:31.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take part
in patriotic events during wartime,

00:21:31.773 --> 00:21:35.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when feelings of national pride ran strong.

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:38.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And despite legal victories
in some countries,

00:21:38.447 --> 00:21:41.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
young ones today are still put to the test.

00:21:42.451 --> 00:21:46.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learned there was
no one answer on what to do.

00:21:46.455 --> 00:21:50.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Situations are different
depending on where we live

00:21:50.325 --> 00:21:53.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or what a person does
to show he’s participating.

00:21:53.362 --> 00:21:55.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in every case,

00:21:55.897 --> 00:21:58.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Christians in some way make it evident

00:21:58.367 --> 00:22:02.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they are respectful observers,
not participants.

00:22:03.638 --> 00:22:06.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We felt good because we had decided

00:22:06.141 --> 00:22:09.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what we would do
to be respectful but neutral

00:22:09.878 --> 00:22:14.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and show Jehovah
that our family worships him alone.

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:19.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since the tests of our neutrality
differ depending on where we live,

00:22:19.955 --> 00:22:22.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why not do what the family in the video did

00:22:22.824 --> 00:22:27.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—devote a Family Worship evening
or personal study session to researching

00:22:27.596 --> 00:22:30.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to avoid participating inadvertently

00:22:30.298 --> 00:22:33.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in any activity
that would violate our Christian neutrality.

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:39.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The subject of neutrality was highlighted
in a Watchtower article that we studied

00:22:39.541 --> 00:22:43.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the congregations in 2016.

00:22:43.078 --> 00:22:46.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this first episode of a new video series

00:22:46.615 --> 00:22:49.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
called Lessons From the Watchtower,

00:22:49.317 --> 00:22:51.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note how our brothers and sisters have applied

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the admonition found
in that very practical article.

00:23:08.336 --> 00:23:10.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a professor of finance,
I need to be well-informed.

00:23:10.572 --> 00:23:13.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a Christian,
I also need to be well-informed,

00:23:13.341 --> 00:23:15.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as do all Christians.

00:23:15.343 --> 00:23:18.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s difficult not to take sides in politics.

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:22.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s very difficult
because we are aware of the issues.

00:23:22.851 --> 00:23:25.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always really liked soccer
ever since I was little.

00:23:25.887 --> 00:23:30.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lived in a poor area,
and soccer was what we used to do for fun.

00:23:31.493 --> 00:23:34.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a journalist
that I liked to keep up with.

00:23:34.196 --> 00:23:38.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He would point out both the good
and the bad on all sides of politics.

00:23:38.233 --> 00:23:42.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when he spoke up and pointed out
only the bad side of a political party,

00:23:42.737 --> 00:23:46.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did not like that.

00:23:46.708 --> 00:23:49.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I live in the downtown area of the city.

00:23:49.044 --> 00:23:53.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is where
the largest political demonstrations take place.

00:23:53.048 --> 00:23:55.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People from this area are really into politics.

00:23:55.117 --> 00:23:57.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have definite opinions.

00:23:57.285 --> 00:24:00.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even though I always knew
that we must remain neutral,

00:24:00.722 --> 00:24:03.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I secretly approved of the demonstrations.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:09.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the outside,
I wasn’t jumping up and down or cheering,

00:24:09.364 --> 00:24:13.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but on the inside,
I was saying: ‘Come on! Let’s win!’

00:24:13.969 --> 00:24:16.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was all about the desire, the crowd,

00:24:16.805 --> 00:24:21.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the pride of your team
having the most victories or the most trophies.

00:24:21.109 --> 00:24:23.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I used to rationalize saying:

00:24:23.278 --> 00:24:26.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I was created in Jehovah’s image,
and Jehovah is a just God.”

00:24:26.915 --> 00:24:29.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was speaking was my sense of justice.

00:24:29.484 --> 00:24:31.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought neutrality was shown through actions

00:24:31.887 --> 00:24:34.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not through what I felt.

00:24:34.222 --> 00:24:37.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The April 2016 Watchtower

00:24:37.092 --> 00:24:40.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has interesting information regarding neutrality.

00:24:40.328 --> 00:24:44.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being neutral means that you
do not consider yourself better than others

00:24:44.699 --> 00:24:47.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because “in God’s sight, all people are equal.”

00:24:47.736 --> 00:24:52.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After studying the article,
I realized that I needed to make changes;

00:24:52.007 --> 00:24:54.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was not being neutral.

00:24:54.009 --> 00:24:55.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I read the article again.

00:24:55.877 --> 00:24:57.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah;

00:24:57.512 --> 00:25:00.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said to him that I knew
it was as if he were speaking to me.

00:25:00.982 --> 00:25:04.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The magazine really touched me deeply.

00:25:04.753 --> 00:25:08.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember reading the article
at least three times that evening.

00:25:08.957 --> 00:25:10.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really surprised.

00:25:10.959 --> 00:25:13.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized how far off I was

00:25:13.828 --> 00:25:16.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from what God wanted me to be on the inside.

00:25:16.765 --> 00:25:19.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second situation mentioned in the article

00:25:19.367 --> 00:25:21.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had to do with news reports and the media.

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:23.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The article even suggested that we limit

00:25:23.939 --> 00:25:28.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our intake of news
that we watch related to politics.

00:25:28.109 --> 00:25:30.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was another phrase
that really moved me.

00:25:30.278 --> 00:25:33.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said:
‘Even if we don’t march with protesters,

00:25:33.515 --> 00:25:35.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might we be with them in spirit?’

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:37.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes! I was with them. Yes!

00:25:37.819 --> 00:25:40.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were several phrases in that article

00:25:40.288 --> 00:25:44.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were written just for me.

00:25:44.659 --> 00:25:47.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I cut back watching
so many news reports

00:25:47.796 --> 00:25:49.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and I had to—

00:25:49.564 --> 00:25:54.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this helped me to have self-control
when I spoke to others at work.

00:25:54.202 --> 00:25:57.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When workmates mentioned
something that was in the news,

00:25:57.339 --> 00:25:59.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t have anything to say
since I hadn’t seen it.

00:25:59.908 --> 00:26:01.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know about it.

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:05.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A workmate would say:
“Did you see that so-and-so said this

00:26:05.213 --> 00:26:07.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that someone else made a statement?”

00:26:07.415 --> 00:26:09.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would say:
“No, I didn’t see it,”

00:26:09.818 --> 00:26:11.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that was the end of the conversation.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:14.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The article mentions Romans 10:12

00:26:14.189 --> 00:26:16.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which says that Jehovah
is “Lord over all” of us,

00:26:16.891 --> 00:26:20.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ‘there is no difference
between Jew and Greek.’

00:26:20.262 --> 00:26:22.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To Jehovah,
it’s not important if my country

00:26:22.897 --> 00:26:26.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has five or six titles
or if it won or lost the World Cup.

00:26:26.768 --> 00:26:29.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To Jehovah, all people are equal.

00:26:30.605 --> 00:26:34.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I took a piece of paper,
just a simple piece of paper,

00:26:34.075 --> 00:26:38.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I wrote on it the four key points
that the article talks about

00:26:38.113 --> 00:26:42.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—four key points
that will help us to remain neutral.

00:26:43.451 --> 00:26:47.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I keep it in my purse;
that way I can always read it at work.

00:26:49.357 --> 00:26:52.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like watching soccer; it’s fun.

00:26:52.127 --> 00:26:54.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still watch it on TV.

00:26:54.429 --> 00:26:57.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still play soccer with my friends at Bethel,

00:26:57.132 --> 00:27:00.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I’ve made an effort to change.

00:27:00.602 --> 00:27:04.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Little by little,
I’ve managed to put soccer in its proper place.

00:27:06.374 --> 00:27:11.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This helps me to keep pride
and nationalism from getting the best of me.

00:27:11.112 --> 00:27:15.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned from this article
not to express opinions about politics.

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:18.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That has to come from deep inside.

00:27:18.253 --> 00:27:21.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I’m convinced
that God’s Kingdom is the best solution

00:27:21.389 --> 00:27:23.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that there’s nothing that comes even close,

00:27:23.758 --> 00:27:26.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remaining neutral will come naturally.

00:27:26.094 --> 00:27:29.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I can’t let my guard down.

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:32.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really enjoy studying
articles from The Watchtower,

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially those
dealing with practical matters.

00:27:34.669 --> 00:27:38.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They help me see the Bible as if it were
a mirror that shows me where I can improve.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Following counsel

00:27:40.942 --> 00:27:43.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and making the changes
suggested in the article

00:27:43.945 --> 00:27:45.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has helped me to speak
with the conviction

00:27:45.914 --> 00:27:50.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that only the Kingdom
can solve mankind’s problems.

00:28:03.965 --> 00:28:08.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because our enemy Satan
tries to break our integrity in many subtle ways,

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:12.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s important to know
ahead of time how we’ll act.

00:28:13.308 --> 00:28:18.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actions are important,
and yet they’re preceded by thoughts,

00:28:18.246 --> 00:28:20.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as one young brother discovered.

00:28:20.448 --> 00:28:24.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this dramatization, note what Bible principle

00:28:24.285 --> 00:28:27.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped him to stay neutral in his heart.

00:28:45.774 --> 00:28:49.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They are no part of the world.”
—John 17:16.

00:28:50.211 --> 00:28:53.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We must remain neutral
in order to be loyal subjects of God’s Kingdom.

00:28:53.715 --> 00:28:55.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Otherwise,
how could we have a clean conscience

00:28:55.717 --> 00:28:57.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when we preach the good news

00:28:57.185 --> 00:28:59.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that only God’s Kingdom
can solve mankind’s problems?

00:28:59.454 --> 00:29:01.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . As Satan’s system nears its end,

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:06.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can expect the issue of neutrality
to become more prominent.”

00:29:07.128 --> 00:29:09.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, people, we’re ready to go.

00:29:09.197 --> 00:29:13.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dawn, Jordan,
can I get you to grab the blinds please?

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:28.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In your work groups this week,
you’ll outline the policies

00:29:28.683 --> 00:29:31.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you feel world governments should implement.

00:29:31.186 --> 00:29:35.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, it’s young people like you,

00:29:35.156 --> 00:29:39.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each of you, who must take action
to solve the problems that threaten our planet.

00:29:59.247 --> 00:30:01.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When war comes,
they’ll look for you and me to do the fighting.

00:30:02.116 --> 00:30:05.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will you speak up and tell them,
‘No, no, we won’t?’

00:30:20.235 --> 00:30:24.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I’m more worried about the elections,
especially for your generation.

00:30:24.939 --> 00:30:27.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, who do you think is going to win?

00:30:27.108 --> 00:30:29.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uhm, well, we believe that—

00:30:30.778 --> 00:30:32.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
uhm . . .

00:30:32.447 --> 00:30:34.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s actually a very interesting question.

00:30:34.816 --> 00:30:38.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as Jehovah’s Witnesses,
we believe that it’s God’s Kingdom

00:30:38.052 --> 00:30:41.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s going to bring about all the solutions
that we need for all of our problems.

00:30:41.222 --> 00:30:42.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, . . .

00:30:42.223 --> 00:30:44.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s £7.50, please.

00:30:44.492 --> 00:30:46.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:30:47.495 --> 00:30:49.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello, how can I help you?

00:30:50.932 --> 00:30:53.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you know, this new government policy

00:30:53.101 --> 00:30:55.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I really think it’s going to work.

00:30:55.503 --> 00:30:57.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re crazy.

00:30:57.772 --> 00:31:00.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With their policies,
we’ll be bankrupt within three years.

00:31:00.441 --> 00:31:03.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if it works, though,
it’s going to make people rich.

00:31:03.244 --> 00:31:04.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who are rich already.

00:31:04.512 --> 00:31:06.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I’m fed up.
They say the same thing.

00:31:23.665 --> 00:31:27.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve invited a panel of experts
to explore these issues,

00:31:27.168 --> 00:31:30.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
namely, can the opposition party win?

00:31:30.271 --> 00:31:33.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will they keep their promises
to lower-income people?

00:31:33.441 --> 00:31:37.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what changes could we expect
on required military service?

00:31:37.278 --> 00:31:39.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll want to hear the answers.

00:31:39.314 --> 00:31:42.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s begin by speaking to John McGarthy,
the minister of education.

00:31:42.784 --> 00:31:44.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If put to the test,

00:31:44.652 --> 00:31:48.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do want to take my stand for Jehovah.

00:31:48.022 --> 00:31:51.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the outcome
of all these things can affect me now

00:31:51.659 --> 00:31:55.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—my family, my goals.

00:31:55.296 --> 00:31:59.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can I stay neutral, even in my heart?

00:32:02.036 --> 00:32:09.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John 17:14:

00:32:09.677 --> 00:32:13.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have given your word to them, 
but the world has hated them,

00:32:13.915 --> 00:32:16.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because they are no part of the world,

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:18.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“just as I am no part of the world.

00:32:18.886 --> 00:32:22.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I do not request
that you take them out of the world,

00:32:22.323 --> 00:32:26.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but that you watch over them
because of the wicked one.

00:32:26.227 --> 00:32:30.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They are no part of the world,
just as I am no part of the world.

00:32:30.331 --> 00:32:34.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Sanctify them by means of the truth;
your word is truth.

00:32:34.402 --> 00:32:37.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Just as you sent me into the world,

00:32:37.038 --> 00:32:39.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I also sent them into the world.

00:32:39.674 --> 00:32:43.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And I am sanctifying myself in their behalf,

00:32:43.044 --> 00:32:46.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they also 
may be sanctified by means of truth.”

00:32:48.116 --> 00:32:50.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No part of the world,

00:32:50.284 --> 00:32:54.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Jesus,
both in thought and action.

00:32:58.059 --> 00:33:00.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure, but in our lifetime?

00:33:00.261 --> 00:33:03.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes! And I have found something
that has helped me to be sure of this.

00:33:03.631 --> 00:33:05.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can I share it with you?

00:33:05.533 --> 00:33:08.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s here at Matthew 24:33.

00:33:08.436 --> 00:33:12.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said: “Likewise also you,
when you see all these things,

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:16.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
know that he is near at the doors.”

00:33:27.555 --> 00:33:29.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our being neutral today is urgent

00:33:29.891 --> 00:33:32.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jehovah’s day is coming quickly.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:36.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On that day, we must be absolutely certain

00:33:36.097 --> 00:33:38.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we are on Jehovah’s side.

00:33:38.566 --> 00:33:40.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this Bethel morning worship,

00:33:40.668 --> 00:33:43.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Anthony Morris of the Governing Body

00:33:43.071 --> 00:33:46.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
explains why we don’t need
to worry about the events to come.

00:33:47.308 --> 00:33:49.310 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, The Watchtower

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:51.846 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from where the comments are taken

00:33:51.846 --> 00:33:53.481 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
had the theme

00:33:53.481 --> 00:33:56.851 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Your Deliverance Is Getting Near.”

00:33:56.851 --> 00:34:00.221 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, this was a sobering and yet

00:34:00.221 --> 00:34:03.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a very encouraging 
Watchtower study article,

00:34:03.725 --> 00:34:07.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that theme 
was taken from Luke chapter 21.

00:34:07.261 --> 00:34:11.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you’d like to find that
—Luke 21—

00:34:11.999 --> 00:34:16.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in the context prior to verse 28,

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:20.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know verse 26: 
“People will become faint out of fear

00:34:20.441 --> 00:34:22.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and expectation of the things

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:25.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
coming upon the inhabited earth.”

00:34:25.613 --> 00:34:29.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then it mentions “the heavens . . . shaken,”

00:34:29.117 --> 00:34:31.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then, “see the Son of man.”

00:34:31.252 --> 00:34:34.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here’s where 
we find the theme, verse 28:

00:34:34.555 --> 00:34:38.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But as these things start to occur,

00:34:38.459 --> 00:34:42.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“stand up straight and lift up your heads,

00:34:42.764 --> 00:34:47.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because your deliverance is getting near.”

00:34:47.001 --> 00:34:52.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as we know, 
this is fulfilled during the great tribulation.

00:34:53.174 --> 00:34:55.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s something to keep in mind,

00:34:55.877 --> 00:35:00.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that at that time 
when these events take place,

00:35:00.047 --> 00:35:03.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’ll be able to stand up

00:35:03.184 --> 00:35:06.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and look forward to their deliverance.

00:35:06.387 --> 00:35:09.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, for a moment, just reflect back

00:35:09.056 --> 00:35:12.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the Hezekiah video

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we enjoyed

00:35:14.262 --> 00:35:17.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the convention season last year.

00:35:17.098 --> 00:35:19.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was amazing!

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:22.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a beautiful job 
the brothers did in Audio/Video

00:35:22.537 --> 00:35:26.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
depicting one angel

00:35:26.007 --> 00:35:30.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that destroyed 185,000 men.

00:35:30.878 --> 00:35:32.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was spectacular!

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:37.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, find Revelation chapter 17

00:35:38.786 --> 00:35:41.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Revelation chapter 17—

00:35:41.989 --> 00:35:44.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is what

00:35:44.892 --> 00:35:48.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is foretold for the near future.

00:35:48.362 --> 00:35:51.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The context here at Revelation 17,

00:35:51.199 --> 00:35:53.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where verse 12 mentions “the ten horns,”

00:35:53.801 --> 00:35:56.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then down into verse 13

00:35:56.871 --> 00:36:01.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—after this “one hour with the wild beast”
(the United Nations)—

00:36:01.075 --> 00:36:03.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they give their “authority to the wild beast.”

00:36:03.277 --> 00:36:07.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Humans in general 
would find that hard to believe

00:36:07.415 --> 00:36:10.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they look 
at what’s going on in the world today.

00:36:10.751 --> 00:36:13.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But here’s what they’re going to do,

00:36:13.187 --> 00:36:15.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse 14:

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:19.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“These will battle with the Lamb,

00:36:19.026 --> 00:36:23.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but because he is Lord of lords 
and King of kings,

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:26.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Lamb will conquer them.

00:36:26.934 --> 00:36:29.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Also, those with him

00:36:29.737 --> 00:36:33.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are called and chosen 
and faithful will do so.”

00:36:34.575 --> 00:36:36.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now,

00:36:36.577 --> 00:36:39.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as good as our brothers are in Audio/Video,

00:36:39.447 --> 00:36:42.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I personally doubt that anyone

00:36:42.483 --> 00:36:47.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could do a videography 
and capture this event.

00:36:47.355 --> 00:36:50.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re talking about Christ Jesus,

00:36:50.258 --> 00:36:52.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the 144,000

00:36:52.927 --> 00:36:56.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
anointed immortal spirit creatures,

00:36:56.697 --> 00:36:59.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then Jesus has the holy angels

00:36:59.367 --> 00:37:02.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are under his direction as King.

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:04.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is going to be spectacular!

00:37:04.405 --> 00:37:06.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, all things are possible with God,

00:37:06.707 --> 00:37:11.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I think they’d have to have Him 
to be able to show a video

00:37:11.279 --> 00:37:15.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to capture what’s coming in the future.

00:37:15.016 --> 00:37:17.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just spectacular!

00:37:17.018 --> 00:37:20.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, just keep in mind 
(and The Watchtower made this clear),

00:37:20.755 --> 00:37:24.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we don’t know the sure 
and exact sequence of events

00:37:24.992 --> 00:37:27.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the time order—
some of it (as The Watchtower says)

00:37:27.862 --> 00:37:30.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will likely overlap.

00:37:30.131 --> 00:37:32.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, what we do know

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:35.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jehovah has been kind about this—

00:37:35.536 --> 00:37:38.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is what’s going to take place

00:37:38.639 --> 00:37:41.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to start the great tribulation.

00:37:41.075 --> 00:37:44.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we find here in verse 15,

00:37:44.312 --> 00:37:48.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll read 
through verse 17 of Revelation 17:

00:37:48.749 --> 00:37:51.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He said to me: ‘The waters that you saw,

00:37:51.686 --> 00:37:53.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘where the prostitute is sitting,

00:37:53.754 --> 00:37:57.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘mean peoples and crowds
and nations and tongues.

00:37:57.258 --> 00:37:59.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And the ten horns 
that you saw and the wild beast,

00:37:59.827 --> 00:38:02.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘these will hate the prostitute

00:38:02.129 --> 00:38:05.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and will make her devastated and naked,

00:38:05.166 --> 00:38:07.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and they will eat up her flesh

00:38:07.435 --> 00:38:11.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and completely burn her with fire.’”

00:38:11.072 --> 00:38:13.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s the fact

00:38:13.808 --> 00:38:17.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verification for why this will happen,

00:38:17.411 --> 00:38:20.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse 17: “For God put it into their hearts

00:38:20.982 --> 00:38:23.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to carry out his thought,

00:38:23.384 --> 00:38:25.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“yes, to carry out their one thought

00:38:25.953 --> 00:38:28.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by giving their kingdom to the wild beast,

00:38:28.556 --> 00:38:31.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until the words of God
will have been accomplished.”

00:38:31.926 --> 00:38:34.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s as good as done.

00:38:34.662 --> 00:38:36.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what’s going to happen

00:38:36.664 --> 00:38:39.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regardless of how people view us

00:38:39.767 --> 00:38:42.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we preach this good news.

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:44.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because this is good news
—the destruction

00:38:44.472 --> 00:38:47.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the world empire of false religion,

00:38:47.208 --> 00:38:49.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the beginning of the great tribulation.

00:38:49.577 --> 00:38:52.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is spectacular news
for God’s people,

00:38:52.947 --> 00:38:57.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and until it takes place,
they won’t believe it.

00:38:57.351 --> 00:39:00.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it will happen because 
Jehovah says it’s going to happen.

00:39:00.955 --> 00:39:05.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’ll be a time for us 
to prove our love for Jehovah God.

00:39:05.559 --> 00:39:09.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll be the only group protected by him.

00:39:09.296 --> 00:39:11.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this was profound, too,

00:39:11.298 --> 00:39:14.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this article in The Watchtower made this—

00:39:14.402 --> 00:39:17.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought it was 
a profound statement when you think

00:39:17.104 --> 00:39:20.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the organization we’re a part of.

00:39:20.107 --> 00:39:23.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said in paragraph 9:

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:26.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This will not be the time to preach

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the ‘good news of the Kingdom.’”

00:39:28.949 --> 00:39:32.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My, we’re a preaching organization.

00:39:32.253 --> 00:39:35.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there’s a time 
we’ll not preach the good news?

00:39:35.756 --> 00:39:37.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:39:37.358 --> 00:39:40.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember one of our favorite verses?

00:39:40.694 --> 00:39:43.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s etched on the minds 
and hearts of God’s people:

00:39:43.898 --> 00:39:46.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And this good news 
of the Kingdom will be preached

00:39:46.067 --> 00:39:49.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all the inhabited earth 
for a witness to all the nations.”

00:39:49.637 --> 00:39:52.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, don’t forget the last part:

00:39:52.273 --> 00:39:55.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And then the end will come.”

00:39:55.643 --> 00:40:00.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So during the great tribulation
—no good news.

00:40:00.648 --> 00:40:04.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, we do know there’ll be preaching.

00:40:04.819 --> 00:40:08.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you think we’re unpopular now?

00:40:08.823 --> 00:40:10.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, my!

00:40:10.691 --> 00:40:14.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice Revelation chapter 16,

00:40:14.395 --> 00:40:18.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in the context 
Armageddon is being addressed,

00:40:18.499 --> 00:40:22.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice verse 21:

00:40:22.369 --> 00:40:26.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then great hailstones, 
each about the weight of a talent,

00:40:26.273 --> 00:40:28.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“fell from heaven on the people,

00:40:28.642 --> 00:40:31.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the people blasphemed God

00:40:31.378 --> 00:40:33.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because of the plague of [the] hail,

00:40:33.747 --> 00:40:37.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the plague was unusually great.”

00:40:37.284 --> 00:40:38.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:40:38.619 --> 00:40:41.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the message and the preaching

00:40:41.889 --> 00:40:44.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are going to be like “hailstones.”

00:40:44.492 --> 00:40:46.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know if you’ve 
ever been in a hailstorm,

00:40:46.794 --> 00:40:51.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but this is a huge hailstorm

00:40:51.031 --> 00:40:53.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being depicted here.

00:40:53.033 --> 00:40:57.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s likely, possibly, a hard-hitting message

00:40:57.104 --> 00:41:00.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maybe a declaration 
announcing that Satan’s world

00:41:00.674 --> 00:41:03.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is about to come to a complete end.

00:41:04.178 --> 00:41:08.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s just stay tuned.

00:41:08.048 --> 00:41:10.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And don’t feel bad—I know.

00:41:10.951 --> 00:41:12.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was out in the ministry

00:41:12.953 --> 00:41:17.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in one territory recently,

00:41:17.057 --> 00:41:19.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s good to suffer reproach.

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:21.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all need that, like Jesus did.

00:41:21.929 --> 00:41:24.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The door-to-door ministry 
is good for us.

00:41:24.698 --> 00:41:28.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But see, if you think 
we’re suffering reproach now—

00:41:28.002 --> 00:41:29.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, get ready!

00:41:29.403 --> 00:41:33.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just training for this future declaration

00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:35.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ll have the privilege to share in.

00:41:35.776 --> 00:41:37.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, keep in mind

00:41:37.778 --> 00:41:40.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there is this event that The Watchtower

00:41:40.581 --> 00:41:43.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did mention in Matthew chapter 24.

00:41:43.684 --> 00:41:45.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you’ll find that,

00:41:45.686 --> 00:41:49.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s nice to have this clear.

00:41:49.156 --> 00:41:52.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew chapter 24,

00:41:52.793 --> 00:41:57.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read verse 31:

00:41:58.432 --> 00:42:01.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he will send out his angels

00:42:01.936 --> 00:42:03.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with a great trumpet sound,

00:42:03.938 --> 00:42:06.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they will gather 
his chosen ones together

00:42:06.507 --> 00:42:08.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from the four winds,

00:42:08.876 --> 00:42:13.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from one extremity of the heavens 
to their other extremity.”

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:16.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what The Watchtower stated there was

00:42:16.116 --> 00:42:18.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it’s not the initial gathering

00:42:18.118 --> 00:42:20.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the anointed nor the final sealing;

00:42:20.354 --> 00:42:23.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is when the remnant
—the remaining ones—

00:42:23.457 --> 00:42:27.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
receive their heavenly reward 
during the great tribulation.

00:42:27.228 --> 00:42:30.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this event takes place at some point

00:42:30.664 --> 00:42:34.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after the beginning of the attack by Gog.

00:42:34.335 --> 00:42:36.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, at that time,

00:42:36.337 --> 00:42:39.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s when Matthew 13:43 is fulfilled:

00:42:39.773 --> 00:42:43.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The righteous ones 
will shine as brightly as the sun

00:42:43.611 --> 00:42:46.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Kingdom of their Father.”

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:51.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as we mentioned
—sobering, yes, but encouraging.

00:42:51.085 --> 00:42:53.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, yes, so encouraging.

00:42:53.354 --> 00:42:56.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, brothers, let’s be confident;

00:42:56.123 --> 00:42:58.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s trust in Jehovah.

00:42:58.125 --> 00:43:01.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no need to be afraid.

00:43:01.328 --> 00:43:04.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s keep up our spiritual routine

00:43:04.632 --> 00:43:06.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prove ourselves ready,

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:10.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the great tribulation is near.

00:43:11.171 --> 00:43:13.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jehovah’s day comes,

00:43:13.307 --> 00:43:17.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brotherhood will be safe because it’s united.

00:43:17.511 --> 00:43:20.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our worldwide unity is but one of the blessings

00:43:20.948 --> 00:43:24.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that result from our Christian neutrality.

00:43:24.218 --> 00:43:27.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this month’s music video,
notice the connection

00:43:27.621 --> 00:43:30.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between the love we enjoy as God’s people

00:43:30.557 --> 00:43:34.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our being “no part of this world.”

00:43:34.061 --> 00:43:38.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The song is entitled “We Are One.”

00:43:48.342 --> 00:43:59.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s trouble in the world, disunity.
No matter where we live, no harmony.

00:44:04.291 --> 00:44:09.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are people suffering,
fighting for change.

00:44:09.897 --> 00:44:16.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But among God’s people,
we trust in his name.

00:44:16.103 --> 00:44:25.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we must stick close to his Word
And remain no part of this world

00:44:25.145 --> 00:44:31.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With love in ev’ry little thing we do.

00:44:31.051 --> 00:44:41.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Show love as we spread the good news,
And feel the love of the brotherhood.

00:44:41.595 --> 00:44:47.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though we stand out as diff’rent,
With Jehovah, we are one.

00:44:57.811 --> 00:45:08.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter where we go from sea to sea,
With God’s people, we find true family.

00:45:08.055 --> 00:45:15.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, there are anxieties, but hope is real—
A paradise to come.

00:45:15.863 --> 00:45:18.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True peace is near.

00:45:19.466 --> 00:45:28.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we keep trusting in his Word
And remain no part of this world

00:45:28.509 --> 00:45:39.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With love in ev’ry little thing we do.
Show love as we spread the good news,

00:45:39.086 --> 00:45:45.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And feel the love of the brotherhood.

00:45:45.092 --> 00:45:50.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though we stand out as diff’rent,
With Jehovah, we are one.

00:45:50.297 --> 00:45:56.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are one.

00:46:00.073 --> 00:46:10.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s stay faithful and endure
And remain no part of this world

00:46:10.784 --> 00:46:21.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With love in ev’ry little thing we do.
Show love as we spread the good news,

00:46:21.261 --> 00:46:30.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And feel the love of the brotherhood.
Though we stand out as diff’rent,

00:46:30.103 --> 00:46:38.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah,
We love in ev’ry little thing we do.

00:46:38.145 --> 00:46:48.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Show love as we spread the good news,
And feel the love of the brotherhood.

00:46:48.055 --> 00:46:56.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though we stand out as diff’rent,
With Jehovah, we are one.

00:47:18.118 --> 00:47:21.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The song was initially written
in the Lingala language,

00:47:21.788 --> 00:47:23.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an African language spoken mainly

00:47:23.857 --> 00:47:27.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Democratic Republic of Congo
and the Republic of Congo.

00:47:27.728 --> 00:47:30.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’d like to hear the song
in the Lingala language,

00:47:30.564 --> 00:47:34.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can now find it
on Video on Demand under the heading “Music.”

00:47:34.801 --> 00:47:37.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While you’re at it, why not listen

00:47:37.437 --> 00:47:40.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to other original songs in different languages?

00:47:40.407 --> 00:47:43.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After you have navigated to the “Music” section,

00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:45.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
change the language of the website

00:47:45.579 --> 00:47:48.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the top right corner
to a language of your choice.

00:47:51.285 --> 00:47:54.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you noticed
the many examples of Christian neutrality

00:47:54.454 --> 00:47:57.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve seen during this program?

00:47:57.124 --> 00:47:59.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, we visited Armenia and learned

00:47:59.626 --> 00:48:02.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how they’ve remained neutral
despite persecution.

00:48:03.797 --> 00:48:06.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the talk, we learned the importance

00:48:06.199 --> 00:48:09.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of remaining neutral at public events.

00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:12.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, we met a number of brothers and sisters

00:48:12.039 --> 00:48:14.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who shared their experiences in applying

00:48:14.508 --> 00:48:17.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Watchtower study article about neutrality.

00:48:18.412 --> 00:48:21.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Morris reminded us
of Jehovah’s protection

00:48:21.081 --> 00:48:23.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah judges this world.

00:48:23.817 --> 00:48:26.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our music video encouraged us

00:48:26.353 --> 00:48:28.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to enjoy the blessings of unity

00:48:28.855 --> 00:48:31.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that result from our Christian neutrality.

00:48:33.727 --> 00:48:35.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And speaking of the music video:

00:48:35.729 --> 00:48:38.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice
how our friends watched the broadcast,

00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:42.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when the postcard came up
at the end of the program, they waved back?

00:48:44.137 --> 00:48:46.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever felt like doing that?

00:48:46.573 --> 00:48:49.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, here’s another opportunity.

00:48:49.843 --> 00:48:54.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s visit our brothers 
and sisters in South Korea.

00:48:54.181 --> 00:48:58.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Kingdom proclaimers arrived in Korea in 1912.

00:48:58.185 --> 00:49:00.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, the Republic of Korea

00:49:00.554 --> 00:49:03.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has some 1,300 congregations

00:49:03.056 --> 00:49:07.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with over 100,000 publishers.

00:49:07.027 --> 00:49:10.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although the peninsula
was under colonial rule for some time

00:49:10.631 --> 00:49:13.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and has been involved in other military conflicts,

00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:17.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses there 
have maintained their Christian neutrality

00:49:17.771 --> 00:49:20.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by not taking sides.

00:49:20.574 --> 00:49:22.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over the last seven decades,

00:49:22.776 --> 00:49:27.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than 19,000 brothers
have been imprisoned for their faith.

00:49:27.681 --> 00:49:30.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2018, a favorable court decision

00:49:30.984 --> 00:49:34.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was handed down
in behalf of these faithful brothers.

00:49:34.321 --> 00:49:36.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the future, we look forward

00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:40.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to even further relief
from fair-minded officials in this country.

00:49:41.461 --> 00:49:45.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the Ganseong Congregation.

00:49:45.065 --> 00:49:48.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their territory has a population
of approximately 23,000

00:49:48.835 --> 00:49:51.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and is partially located

00:49:51.138 --> 00:49:53.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the demilitarized zone
near the North Korean border.

00:49:55.108 --> 00:49:58.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not uncommon for the almost 50 publishers

00:49:58.078 --> 00:50:00.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to conduct over 60 Bible studies each month.

00:50:01.515 --> 00:50:02.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact,

00:50:02.749 --> 00:50:07.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some 30 publishers
—or 60 percent of the congregation—

00:50:07.387 --> 00:50:10.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
serve as regular pioneers.

00:50:10.357 --> 00:50:13.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of its location, many of the residents

00:50:13.026 --> 00:50:17.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the villages in this area
are isolated from the rest of the country.

00:50:17.097 --> 00:50:19.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters

00:50:19.099 --> 00:50:22.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
often meet people who work for the military.

00:50:22.569 --> 00:50:25.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of the congregation’s proximity
to the border,

00:50:25.806 --> 00:50:29.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
busloads of tourists come on a regular basis

00:50:29.142 --> 00:50:31.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see the North Korean border.

00:50:32.446 --> 00:50:35.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To reach such visitors with the good news,
our brothers have organized

00:50:35.816 --> 00:50:39.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
public witnessing stands
in a number of locations.

00:50:39.453 --> 00:50:43.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love our brothers and sisters
in the Ganseong Congregation very much.

00:50:44.925 --> 00:50:48.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they send their love
to all of us around the world.

00:50:48.929 --> 00:50:52.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is JW Broadcasting

00:50:52.065 --> 00:50:55.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the world headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
