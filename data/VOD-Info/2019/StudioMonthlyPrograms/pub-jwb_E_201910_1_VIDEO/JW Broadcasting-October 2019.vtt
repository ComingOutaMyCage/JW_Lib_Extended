Welcome to JW Broadcasting®.

00:00:05.255 --> 00:00:10.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This month, we focus 
on how we can refine ourselves as Christians

00:00:10.226 --> 00:00:13.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by imitating Jehovah’s holiness.

00:00:13.563 --> 00:00:17.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you sometimes say things you later regret

00:00:17.167 --> 00:00:20.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—something unkind,
perhaps critical of others?

00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:22.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll learn from this dramatization

00:00:22.806 --> 00:00:25.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to adjust
not only what we say

00:00:25.975 --> 00:00:29.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also how we think.

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:34.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re a young person,
do you ever feel you’re in a fight

00:00:34.517 --> 00:00:36.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a fight to please Jehovah,

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:40.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a fight to be joyful despite opposition?

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll enjoy our new music video.

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:47.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of Jehovah’s people have suffered

00:00:47.363 --> 00:00:50.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
disappointing spiritual setbacks.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah lovingly wants
people to return to him.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see how he helped this man

00:00:56.372 --> 00:00:58.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
turn his life around.

00:00:58.775 --> 00:01:01.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of this and more

00:01:01.177 --> 00:01:05.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on JW Broadcasting for October 2019!

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:27.904 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When I say the words “holy” and “holiness,”

00:01:27.904 --> 00:01:30.039 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
what comes to your mind?

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.877 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Many think of words like “clean” and “pure.”

00:01:33.877 --> 00:01:36.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s change the question a little.

00:01:36.312 --> 00:01:38.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who comes to your mind?

00:01:38.715 --> 00:01:41.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likely, you think of Jehovah.

00:01:41.417 --> 00:01:45.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might also picture
Jesus Christ and the holy angels.

00:01:45.255 --> 00:01:48.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But do you think of imperfect humans?

00:01:48.925 --> 00:01:51.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can humans be described as holy?

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:53.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know this because humans
were created in God’s image.

00:01:57.534 --> 00:02:00.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as we can reflect godly qualities

00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:03.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—such as love, kindness, and self-control—

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:05.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can reflect holiness.

00:02:05.942 --> 00:02:09.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How seriously should we take holiness?

00:02:09.712 --> 00:02:12.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s no small matter.

00:02:12.282 --> 00:02:16.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, the world around us
is increasing in badness.

00:02:16.186 --> 00:02:19.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Timothy 3:13 warns

00:02:19.522 --> 00:02:23.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ‘wicked men
would advance from bad to worse.’

00:02:23.026 --> 00:02:25.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Undoubtedly, before the end,

00:02:25.328 --> 00:02:29.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan’s efforts
to promote wickedness will intensify.

00:02:29.098 --> 00:02:32.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we must intensify our efforts

00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:37.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be holy and reject all badness.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who do you think are Satan’s primary targets?

00:02:41.811 --> 00:02:43.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are.

00:02:43.813 --> 00:02:47.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He and the demons are
like a pack of hungry lions

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looking to devour us.

00:02:49.986 --> 00:02:52.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being a publisher of the good news

00:02:52.188 --> 00:02:56.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a privilege that Satan seeks to attack.

00:02:56.492 --> 00:02:59.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you a parent with children?

00:02:59.395 --> 00:03:03.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think Satan
wants you to become unclean?

00:03:03.366 --> 00:03:05.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:03:05.401 --> 00:03:08.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows that devouring a family head

00:03:08.071 --> 00:03:10.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could weaken an entire family.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the congregation,

00:03:12.742 --> 00:03:15.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan would love to devour
you dear pioneers,

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ministerial servants, and elders.

00:03:18.715 --> 00:03:23.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you in the circuit work?
a missionary? a Bethelite?

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a sacred privilege!

00:03:25.922 --> 00:03:30.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But remember, it also means
that we have a big target on our back.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan and the demons would love

00:03:33.096 --> 00:03:36.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to penetrate our clean and holy position.

00:03:36.666 --> 00:03:39.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doing so could impact
the Kingdom work

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or stumble others.

00:03:41.838 --> 00:03:45.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we can’t be complacent.

00:03:45.508 --> 00:03:48.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must intensify our efforts

00:03:48.111 --> 00:03:50.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reject all badness.

00:03:50.546 --> 00:03:54.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thus, holiness is a vital topic!

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:58.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To that end,
the theme for this month’s program

00:03:58.021 --> 00:04:02.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is “Perfecting Holiness in the Fear of God.”

00:04:02.525 --> 00:04:07.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s based on 2 Corinthians 7:1.

00:04:07.297 --> 00:04:10.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To begin, we need to better understand

00:04:10.967 --> 00:04:14.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Source of holiness, Jehovah God.

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:17.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we read the Bible, we see that holiness

00:04:17.941 --> 00:04:22.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is an important quality
that Jehovah wants us to know about him.

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:25.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible contains many verses

00:04:25.114 --> 00:04:29.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that associate God’s name
with the words “holy” and “holiness.”

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your copy of the Bible

00:04:32.055 --> 00:04:35.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to one example in Isaiah chapter 6.

00:04:35.825 --> 00:04:40.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll start at Isaiah 6:1.

00:04:40.296 --> 00:04:44.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now imagine that you’re the prophet Isaiah,

00:04:44.334 --> 00:04:46.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who received a divine vision.

00:04:46.936 --> 00:04:50.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you have seen and heard?

00:04:50.006 --> 00:04:53.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read verses 1 to 3:

00:04:53.176 --> 00:04:56.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the year that King Uzziah died,

00:04:56.713 --> 00:05:01.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I saw Jehovah sitting
on a lofty and elevated throne,

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:04.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the skirts
of his robe filled the temple.

00:05:04.821 --> 00:05:07.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Seraphs were standing above him;

00:05:07.657 --> 00:05:09.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“each had six wings.

00:05:09.859 --> 00:05:13.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Each covered his face with two
and covered his feet with two,

00:05:13.896 --> 00:05:17.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and each of them would fly about with two.

00:05:17.033 --> 00:05:19.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And one called to the other:

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:23.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of armies.

00:05:23.673 --> 00:05:27.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The whole earth is filled with his glory.’”

00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:31.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah was likely filled with awe.

00:05:31.147 --> 00:05:34.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 2 indicates that he saw seraphs,

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spirit creatures evidently of very high rank.

00:05:38.287 --> 00:05:41.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we learn from their song?

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their repeating the word “holy” three times

00:05:44.494 --> 00:05:48.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
teaches us that Jehovah
is holy to the superlative degree.

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:52.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one else is as holy as he is.

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:56.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what exactly is holiness?

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does it mean to be holy?

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:00.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s dig deeper.

00:06:00.743 --> 00:06:03.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can do so with a helpful tool found

00:06:03.312 --> 00:06:05.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the revised <i>New World Translation. </i>

00:06:05.882 --> 00:06:08.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you don’t have
the revised edition in your language,

00:06:08.985 --> 00:06:11.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll share the key point in just a moment.

00:06:11.821 --> 00:06:14.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the revised printed edition,

00:06:14.023 --> 00:06:18.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the glossary is located
several pages after Revelation

00:06:18.761 --> 00:06:22.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and immediately after
the “Bible Words Index.”

00:06:22.031 --> 00:06:25.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The topics are arranged alphabetically.

00:06:25.068 --> 00:06:29.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So please find the entry
for “Holy; Holiness.”

00:06:29.739 --> 00:06:33.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you are using <i>JW Library®, </i>

00:06:33.142 --> 00:06:36.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here are two ways to get to the glossary.

00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:39.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the app, go to the Bible.

00:06:39.782 --> 00:06:41.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then at the top of the screen,

00:06:41.784 --> 00:06:45.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tap on the magnifying glass
to start a search.

00:06:45.088 --> 00:06:47.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then type in the word “holy.”

00:06:47.924 --> 00:06:50.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon you’ll see an entry from the glossary.

00:06:50.693 --> 00:06:52.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tap on that.

00:06:52.695 --> 00:06:55.398 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Another way is to go to Publications

00:06:55.398 --> 00:06:57.433 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and then Books.

00:06:57.433 --> 00:07:01.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From there you can open the glossary
and find the entry for “holy.”

00:07:01.904 --> 00:07:03.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ready?

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read it:

00:07:05.942 --> 00:07:10.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A quality possessed inherently by Jehovah;

00:07:10.546 --> 00:07:15.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a state of absolute
moral purity and sacredness.

00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:19.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When referring to humans, animals, things,

00:07:19.122 --> 00:07:21.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“places, time periods, and activities,

00:07:21.657 --> 00:07:24.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the original Hebrew word conveys the thought

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of separateness, exclusiveness,

00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:29.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or sanctification to the holy God;

00:07:29.899 --> 00:07:34.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a state of being set aside
for Jehovah’s service.

00:07:34.303 --> 00:07:36.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the Christian Greek Scriptures,

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:39.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the words rendered ‘holy’ and ‘holiness’

00:07:39.242 --> 00:07:42.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“likewise denote separation to God.

00:07:42.645 --> 00:07:45.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The words are also used to refer

00:07:45.581 --> 00:07:50.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to purity in one’s personal conduct.”

00:07:51.354 --> 00:07:53.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did we learn?

00:07:53.222 --> 00:07:56.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, we’re reminded that Jehovah is pure

00:07:56.092 --> 00:07:58.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the absolute sense.

00:07:58.094 --> 00:08:00.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what does it mean that holiness

00:08:00.263 --> 00:08:03.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a quality that he possesses inherently?

00:08:03.633 --> 00:08:05.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s illustrate.

00:08:05.668 --> 00:08:10.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider the words “human” and “imperfect.”

00:08:10.039 --> 00:08:13.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, those two words naturally go together.

00:08:13.476 --> 00:08:16.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imperfection is within all of us

00:08:16.312 --> 00:08:18.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and affects everything we do.

00:08:18.848 --> 00:08:21.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now consider another set of words

00:08:21.817 --> 00:08:24.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that consistently go together:

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah” and “holy.”

00:08:28.357 --> 00:08:31.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Holiness permeates Jehovah.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He doesn’t have to perfect
holiness like we do.

00:08:34.897 --> 00:08:38.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything about him
is inherently clean,

00:08:38.467 --> 00:08:41.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pure, and upright.

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:45.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a contrast
Jehovah’s holiness is to the world around us!

00:08:45.908 --> 00:08:48.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, virtually everything

00:08:48.277 --> 00:08:51.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about human society alienated from God

00:08:51.314 --> 00:08:53.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is polluted in some way,

00:08:53.316 --> 00:08:57.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
either by inherited imperfection
or by outright wickedness.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:02.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah
is completely removed from sinfulness.

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:05.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll never be polluted by badness.

00:09:05.261 --> 00:09:09.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll never turn corrupt,
immoral, or abusive.

00:09:09.265 --> 00:09:13.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he’s absolutely holy,

00:09:13.302 --> 00:09:16.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s completely reliable.

00:09:16.305 --> 00:09:20.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This means that Jehovah is the ideal Father.

00:09:20.676 --> 00:09:24.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How encouraging and reassuring!

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:28.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s holiness is beautiful.

00:09:28.484 --> 00:09:31.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about the physical world.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you feel about beautiful things?

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:38.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you drawn to them or repelled by them?

00:09:38.494 --> 00:09:42.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, look at these landscapes.

00:09:42.064 --> 00:09:44.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do they make you feel?

00:09:44.533 --> 00:09:47.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to spend time here?

00:09:47.436 --> 00:09:50.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you see yourself walking here,

00:09:50.239 --> 00:09:54.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
filling your lungs with clean, fresh air?

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or how about drinking

00:09:56.178 --> 00:10:00.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a river of pure, crystal-clear water?

00:10:00.416 --> 00:10:04.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How we yearn to live in such conditions!

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we will!

00:10:06.055 --> 00:10:08.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But have you ever wondered what it is

00:10:08.758 --> 00:10:11.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about these images that’s so appealing?

00:10:11.661 --> 00:10:16.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Simply put, everything is pure and clean.

00:10:16.232 --> 00:10:19.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand, if these same locations

00:10:19.935 --> 00:10:24.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were filled with garbage, graffiti, and smog,

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would you still want to be there?

00:10:26.842 --> 00:10:28.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likely not.

00:10:28.978 --> 00:10:32.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pollution and filth are not attractive.

00:10:32.548 --> 00:10:34.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the point?

00:10:34.784 --> 00:10:38.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re naturally drawn to beauty.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:43.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beauty is associated with things
that are clean, pure, and bright.

00:10:43.225 --> 00:10:46.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s how Jehovah

00:10:46.262 --> 00:10:49.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wants us to view his holiness.

00:10:49.332 --> 00:10:53.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meditating on this aspect
of God’s personality

00:10:53.402 --> 00:10:56.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
draws us closer to him.

00:10:56.672 --> 00:10:59.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And though he hates all sin,

00:10:59.241 --> 00:11:03.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his Word confirms that he doesn’t hate us.

00:11:03.479 --> 00:11:05.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of this stirs within us

00:11:05.981 --> 00:11:09.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a desire to perfect holiness.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:15.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s now open to 2 Corinthians 7:1,

00:11:15.424 --> 00:11:17.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our theme scripture.

00:11:17.426 --> 00:11:20.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though Paul wrote this to one congregation,

00:11:20.496 --> 00:11:22.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah preserved it for us.

00:11:22.798 --> 00:11:24.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says:

00:11:24.834 --> 00:11:27.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore, since we have these promises,

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:32.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“beloved ones, let us cleanse ourselves

00:11:32.308 --> 00:11:36.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of every defilement of flesh and spirit,

00:11:36.312 --> 00:11:40.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perfecting holiness in the fear of God.”

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:45.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The concluding part of the verse
serves as the basis for our theme.

00:11:45.888 --> 00:11:49.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does it mean to perfect something?

00:11:49.759 --> 00:11:52.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
According to one dictionary,

00:11:52.027 --> 00:11:56.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “perfect” means
“to bring to a state of supreme excellence,”

00:11:56.499 --> 00:12:01.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “rid of faults,” to “improve” or “refine.”

00:12:01.237 --> 00:12:05.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As an example, perhaps you enjoy a hobby

00:12:05.107 --> 00:12:09.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like drawing, taking photographs,
or playing an instrument.

00:12:09.545 --> 00:12:12.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If an expert in that field told you

00:12:12.581 --> 00:12:15.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you should <i>perfec</i><i>t </i> your talent,

00:12:15.584 --> 00:12:17.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what would he mean?

00:12:17.586 --> 00:12:22.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, he’s confirming
that you have some experience already.

00:12:22.291 --> 00:12:25.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, he’s telling you:

00:12:25.094 --> 00:12:29.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You have what it takes
to be even better in the future.

00:12:29.031 --> 00:12:32.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can see your potential!”

00:12:32.601 --> 00:12:36.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, perfecting a hobby takes time.

00:12:36.338 --> 00:12:39.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same is true of our holiness.

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:42.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The book
<i>Word Pictures in the New Testament</i><i> </i><i> </i>notes

00:12:42.978 --> 00:12:45.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the word “perfecting”

00:12:45.481 --> 00:12:48.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 2 Corinthians 7:1

00:12:48.284 --> 00:12:52.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means “not a sudden attainment
of complete holiness,

00:12:52.455 --> 00:12:55.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but a continuous process.”

00:12:55.691 --> 00:12:59.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah, the expert in holiness

00:12:59.962 --> 00:13:04.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our best Friend, is appealing to us.

00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:06.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In effect, he’s saying:

00:13:06.168 --> 00:13:09.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I see your potential!

00:13:09.572 --> 00:13:13.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You have what it takes
to make progress in holiness.

00:13:13.709 --> 00:13:17.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep working to perfect it!’

00:13:17.179 --> 00:13:20.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does such an appeal touch your heart?

00:13:20.749 --> 00:13:22.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could ask ourselves,

00:13:22.918 --> 00:13:27.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Is there an area in my life
where I can refine my holiness?’

00:13:27.857 --> 00:13:32.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, consider the matter
of physical cleanness.

00:13:32.761 --> 00:13:36.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chapter 8 of the book
<i>How to Remain in God’s Love </i>

00:13:36.699 --> 00:13:39.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
discusses the need to glorify Jehovah

00:13:39.768 --> 00:13:42.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by keeping our body and clothing,

00:13:42.171 --> 00:13:46.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our home and surroundings,
and our place of worship clean.

00:13:46.709 --> 00:13:51.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being physically clean
benefits us and those around us.

00:13:51.447 --> 00:13:55.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More important, it honors our Holy Father.

00:13:56.585 --> 00:14:01.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But our personal cleaning program
must go below the surface.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:04.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our theme text, Jehovah urges us

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:09.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “cleanse ourselves
of every defilement of flesh and spirit.”

00:14:09.231 --> 00:14:13.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This involves every aspect of our lives.

00:14:13.102 --> 00:14:16.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, something we read in the Bible

00:14:16.071 --> 00:14:18.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or that we hear at a meeting may warn us

00:14:18.841 --> 00:14:22.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our thoughts need further refinement.

00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:26.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps we detect
a tendency toward materialism.

00:14:26.148 --> 00:14:28.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or we realize that our precious time

00:14:28.684 --> 00:14:31.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is being consumed by social media,

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:35.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
surfing the Internet, or playing video games.

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:39.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Ephesians 4:23, 24, we’re urged

00:14:39.495 --> 00:14:43.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “continue to be made new
in [our] dominant mental attitude”

00:14:43.866 --> 00:14:47.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to “put on the new personality.”

00:14:47.536 --> 00:14:49.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our challenge might be

00:14:49.605 --> 00:14:54.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a deeply ingrained,
negative personality trait.

00:14:54.009 --> 00:14:57.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A sister named Cristina admitted:

00:14:57.379 --> 00:15:01.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I often find myself
looking enviously at others.

00:15:01.483 --> 00:15:05.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I compare what they have
with what I don’t have.”

00:15:05.754 --> 00:15:09.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, these are just a few examples.

00:15:09.558 --> 00:15:13.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And these may not be our weaknesses,

00:15:13.262 --> 00:15:15.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the lesson is clear:

00:15:15.364 --> 00:15:18.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of us need to keep examining ourselves.

00:15:18.934 --> 00:15:20.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, brothers and sisters,

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:24.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we identify a personal weakness,

00:15:24.406 --> 00:15:26.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what should we do?

00:15:26.442 --> 00:15:28.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For illustration purposes,

00:15:28.978 --> 00:15:33.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s use the example
of Cristina and her battle with envy.

00:15:33.816 --> 00:15:36.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A three-step program

00:15:36.151 --> 00:15:40.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to change our dominant mental attitude

00:15:40.222 --> 00:15:43.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was published on page 11 of the June 2019

00:15:43.859 --> 00:15:46.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
study edition of <i>The Watchtower. </i>

00:15:46.295 --> 00:15:49.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the first thing Cristina should do?

00:15:49.665 --> 00:15:53.869 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Step 1: She needs to talk to Jehovah,

00:15:53.869 --> 00:15:55.904 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
admitting that she recognizes

00:15:55.904 --> 00:15:57.940 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the need to change.

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If she prays regularly

00:16:00.075 --> 00:16:03.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Jehovah
to “put within [her] a new spirit,”

00:16:03.379 --> 00:16:06.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our holy God will help her.

00:16:06.048 --> 00:16:09.752 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Step 2: She needs to meditate

00:16:09.752 --> 00:16:11.787 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so as to examine herself

00:16:11.787 --> 00:16:13.822 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in the mirror of God’s Word.

00:16:13.822 --> 00:16:16.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, she might think deeply

00:16:16.859 --> 00:16:20.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the fact that “love is not jealous”

00:16:20.396 --> 00:16:23.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “does not look for its own interests.”

00:16:23.632 --> 00:16:27.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This would help Cristina to hate envy.

00:16:27.369 --> 00:16:29.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Step 3:

00:16:29.505 --> 00:16:32.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She needs to assess her relationships

00:16:32.675 --> 00:16:35.477 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and choose good association.

00:16:35.477 --> 00:16:38.347 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Could it be that negative gossip,

00:16:38.347 --> 00:16:40.983 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
either in person or online,

00:16:40.983 --> 00:16:43.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is shaping her thinking?

00:16:43.318 --> 00:16:47.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, she’d be wise
to choose better association.

00:16:47.656 --> 00:16:52.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah’s blessing
upon Cristina’s personal efforts

00:16:52.528 --> 00:16:56.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will enable her to perfect holiness.

00:16:56.565 --> 00:17:01.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These three steps can help us do the same.

00:17:02.371 --> 00:17:05.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s now review our key points.

00:17:05.708 --> 00:17:10.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, wickedness
is going “from bad to worse,”

00:17:10.512 --> 00:17:15.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we need to intensify
our efforts to be holy.

00:17:15.517 --> 00:17:20.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, since Jehovah
is the Source of holiness,

00:17:20.522 --> 00:17:24.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everything about him
is clean, pure, and upright.

00:17:24.893 --> 00:17:28.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This beautiful quality draws us to him

00:17:28.263 --> 00:17:31.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and moves us to be holy.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Third and most important,

00:17:34.069 --> 00:17:37.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah appeals to us

00:17:37.106 --> 00:17:42.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “cleanse ourselves
of every defilement of flesh and spirit.”

00:17:42.044 --> 00:17:45.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So may we accept Jehovah’s help

00:17:45.614 --> 00:17:49.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and work to perfect holiness in God’s fear.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even as we strive to perfect holiness,

00:17:54.857 --> 00:17:56.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we don’t look down on people

00:17:56.859 --> 00:17:59.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have been molded by the world around us.

00:17:59.661 --> 00:18:02.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following experience from Italy,

00:18:02.498 --> 00:18:05.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how a group of young men

00:18:05.367 --> 00:18:09.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had a rough start in life
were drawn to the truth

00:18:09.972 --> 00:18:14.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what a courageous sister did
to reach their hearts.

00:18:18.714 --> 00:18:21.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our parents loved us,

00:18:21.483 --> 00:18:23.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they did it in the wrong way.

00:18:23.619 --> 00:18:28.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would often turn violent,
so we learned that way of life.

00:18:29.491 --> 00:18:31.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember that ever since I was young,

00:18:31.627 --> 00:18:35.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was afraid of coming home one day
and not finding my parents together.

00:18:35.497 --> 00:18:38.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because as far back as I remember,
they have always argued with each other.

00:18:41.436 --> 00:18:44.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we grew up with those values
and those ways of thinking

00:18:44.506 --> 00:18:48.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that led us to become
a group that was known and feared 

00:18:48.143 --> 00:18:51.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the area
because of our violent, immoral lifestyle

00:18:51.847 --> 00:18:53.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was devoted to drugs.

00:18:55.851 --> 00:18:57.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had no rules!

00:18:57.352 --> 00:19:00.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were people
that you should stay away from.

00:19:04.927 --> 00:19:08.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was one of those regular mornings
when we were home alone.

00:19:08.931 --> 00:19:13.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it became our hideout
—the place we would meet.

00:19:13.168 --> 00:19:15.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had skipped school,

00:19:15.237 --> 00:19:16.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our parents didn’t know.

00:19:16.939 --> 00:19:20.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was with Federico
and Raffaele when two sisters,

00:19:20.876 --> 00:19:23.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
two of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
rang the doorbell.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we had them come in,
so we could make fun of them.

00:19:27.983 --> 00:19:31.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as a matter of fact, that’s what we did.

00:19:31.653 --> 00:19:35.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember that Maria
and the sister that was with her

00:19:35.157 --> 00:19:38.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were two very sincere and genuine people.

00:19:39.528 --> 00:19:42.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They showed courage
as they brought us the truth.

00:19:47.102 --> 00:19:50.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was surprised that they were so kind,
despite that my tone of voice was mocking.

00:19:50.973 --> 00:19:53.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I really appreciated their kindness.

00:19:53.575 --> 00:19:58.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She didn’t let anything stop her,
not even the way we looked.

00:19:58.146 --> 00:20:01.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really touched
by the conversation with Maria,

00:20:03.585 --> 00:20:05.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I thought I would never see her again.

00:20:05.587 --> 00:20:08.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who would ever come back to people like us?

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:17.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maria didn’t give up.

00:20:17.432 --> 00:20:22.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She came back with an older pioneer brother
who wasn’t scared of us

00:20:22.037 --> 00:20:25.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with courage started to preach.

00:20:25.507 --> 00:20:29.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really started
to change my life and make progress.

00:20:29.945 --> 00:20:32.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Immediately, I started to speak

00:20:32.047 --> 00:20:35.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what I
was learning with all my friends.

00:20:35.217 --> 00:20:38.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What surprised me was my mother’s reaction.

00:20:38.453 --> 00:20:40.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She wasn’t happy at all.

00:20:40.555 --> 00:20:43.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She reacted really violently.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:51.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They thought that I was going mad

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that I was being brainwashed.

00:20:54.002 --> 00:20:57.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember that they
would do everything to remind me

00:20:57.973 --> 00:21:00.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the strong friendship that was between us.

00:21:00.876 --> 00:21:03.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they would put pressure on me emotionally.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to make a choice.

00:21:07.282 --> 00:21:10.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although I did love them
and was close to them,

00:21:10.953 --> 00:21:13.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I made the drastic decision to tell them

00:21:13.622 --> 00:21:18.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that from then on I would no longer
be staying in their company.

00:21:20.262 --> 00:21:22.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This situation made me really intrigued.

00:21:22.331 --> 00:21:24.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, I ended up studying with Francesco.

00:21:24.599 --> 00:21:28.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His determination really made me think.

00:21:28.837 --> 00:21:32.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was obvious
that the things he was telling us

00:21:32.507 --> 00:21:35.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were actually real—it was the truth.

00:21:35.777 --> 00:21:39.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also, the strength
it took to go forward with this

00:21:39.681 --> 00:21:43.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his determination to leave his friends—
was surely what made

00:21:43.552 --> 00:21:47.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of us seriously interested
in the message he was preaching.

00:21:50.392 --> 00:21:53.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would blame it on the truth
because it was taking my friend away from me

00:21:53.295 --> 00:21:55.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a friend with whom
I used to do the things I liked.

00:21:57.799 --> 00:22:01.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, inside I knew that even though
I told him he had gone mad,

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:04.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that inside
there must have been something powerful

00:22:06.608 --> 00:22:08.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he was so convinced,

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:11.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we could all sense his conviction.

00:22:11.279 --> 00:22:14.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I realized
that there was really something there.

00:22:14.583 --> 00:22:19.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To my surprise, one after the other,

00:22:19.187 --> 00:22:22.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of my friends started studying the Bible.

00:22:22.391 --> 00:22:25.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I studied,
I realized that it was the truth.

00:22:25.861 --> 00:22:29.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It used to be hatred
that always motivated my choices.

00:22:29.398 --> 00:22:33.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I act according to love,
and this makes me feel good.

00:22:35.437 --> 00:22:38.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can now say that thanks to Maria 

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:41.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Francesco,
Jehovah tried to draw me to Him.

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:44.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I believe it’s been a miracle from Jehovah.

00:22:44.446 --> 00:22:47.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The truth helped me cultivate the qualities

00:22:47.849 --> 00:22:50.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of peace and joy

00:22:50.452 --> 00:22:52.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the personality that has made it possible

00:22:52.454 --> 00:22:55.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for me to have the family I never had.

00:22:57.059 --> 00:23:01.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The greatest satisfaction I have in life
is to have a relationship with Jehovah.

00:23:01.263 --> 00:23:03.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I see someone

00:23:03.799 --> 00:23:07.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like we used to be,
I feel motivated to speak to them.

00:23:07.636 --> 00:23:10.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The patience that Maria showed
motivates me to be patient.

00:23:13.108 --> 00:23:16.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite our reputation,
Maria did not give up.

00:23:19.047 --> 00:23:21.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She showed us

00:23:21.083 --> 00:23:25.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in Jehovah’s eyes,
no one is beyond recovery

00:23:25.387 --> 00:23:27.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no one.

00:23:29.357 --> 00:23:31.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before they found the truth,

00:23:31.827 --> 00:23:34.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those young men were, as they put it,

00:23:34.596 --> 00:23:37.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“people that you should stay away from.”

00:23:37.232 --> 00:23:40.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you have hesitated to give a witness?

00:23:40.836 --> 00:23:43.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our sister Maria didn’t.

00:23:43.271 --> 00:23:47.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And did you notice what our brother did
when he embraced the truth?

00:23:47.175 --> 00:23:51.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He went to his friends
and broke off his association.

00:23:51.413 --> 00:23:56.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew he needed friends
who shared his determination to serve God.

00:23:56.151 --> 00:23:58.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So do we.

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:01.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see the wonderful results.

00:24:01.223 --> 00:24:03.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of them are now brothers.

00:24:03.792 --> 00:24:06.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They cleansed themselves.

00:24:06.027 --> 00:24:09.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what was
the most meaningful transformation?

00:24:09.397 --> 00:24:11.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brother said it:

00:24:11.399 --> 00:24:14.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘It used to be hatred
that motivated my choices.

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:17.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now it’s love.’

00:24:17.506 --> 00:24:22.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether we’re new in the truth
or have served Jehovah for decades,

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:27.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can perfect holiness
and move forward as spiritual people.

00:24:27.315 --> 00:24:30.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see that in our next segment.

00:24:30.552 --> 00:24:35.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look for how our brothers
applied good suggestions from <i>The Watchtower.</i>

00:24:47.435 --> 00:24:50.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The challenge of serving
in a foreign country can sometimes be that

00:24:50.872 --> 00:24:53.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you’ve made that move
and you’ve learned a foreign language,

00:24:53.975 --> 00:24:56.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can feel like you’ve done enough.

00:24:56.011 --> 00:24:59.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was brought up by a Witness mother,

00:24:59.014 --> 00:25:01.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I studied the Bible since I was small.

00:25:01.783 --> 00:25:05.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I thought I had
Bible knowledge to some extent.

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife and I have enjoyed

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:11.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the traveling work for 18 years.

00:25:11.159 --> 00:25:13.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we get older,
trials that we never experienced

00:25:13.962 --> 00:25:17.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we were young
have come up one after another.

00:25:17.032 --> 00:25:20.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After I got married and had children,

00:25:20.202 --> 00:25:23.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had a hard time explaining

00:25:23.104 --> 00:25:27.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the backgrounds
of some Bible characters or Biblical history

00:25:27.442 --> 00:25:31.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I studied the Bible with my children.

00:25:31.346 --> 00:25:33.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I realized

00:25:33.348 --> 00:25:36.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I did not have enough Bible knowledge.

00:25:36.952 --> 00:25:39.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And another challenge can be

00:25:39.888 --> 00:25:42.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’re dealing
with a foreign culture in the territory,

00:25:42.857 --> 00:25:46.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you also have
many different cultures in the congregation.

00:25:46.728 --> 00:25:49.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I struggle
to fulfill various responsibilities

00:25:49.764 --> 00:25:52.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a balanced way

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:56.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—things such as caring for aged parents
and our own health issues—

00:25:56.204 --> 00:25:58.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it can be a source of stress

00:25:58.473 --> 00:26:01.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cause tension between my wife and me.

00:26:01.443 --> 00:26:05.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The study article
“Move Forward as a Spiritual Person!”

00:26:05.347 --> 00:26:08.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in February 2018 was a big help.

00:26:08.783 --> 00:26:10.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The expressions:

00:26:10.852 --> 00:26:12.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Once we have
identified areas for improvement,

00:26:12.954 --> 00:26:15.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to take positive steps”

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:18.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that “it is a life-and-death matter”

00:26:18.426 --> 00:26:20.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really touched my heart.

00:26:20.762 --> 00:26:24.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized
that I needed to scrutinize my life seriously

00:26:24.933 --> 00:26:29.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and make improvements
for my own future and that of my family.

00:26:29.137 --> 00:26:32.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The article had a quote
from Brother Barr that said:

00:26:32.073 --> 00:26:35.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Many fail because they
are not diligent enough to grow mighty.”

00:26:35.277 --> 00:26:36.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This made me think,

00:26:36.778 --> 00:26:40.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Am I mighty enough
to overcome any challenges

00:26:40.548 --> 00:26:43.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘that might come up,
difficulties with brothers and sisters,

00:26:43.585 --> 00:26:46.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way that pleases Jehovah?’

00:26:46.121 --> 00:26:48.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To move ahead as a spiritual person,

00:26:48.056 --> 00:26:51.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that I needed
to get Jehovah’s thinking on matters

00:26:51.126 --> 00:26:53.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and really look at Bible principles.

00:26:53.094 --> 00:26:55.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that means letting go of my pride;

00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:58.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when it comes back,
letting go of it again

00:26:58.233 --> 00:27:02.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and really making
Jehovah’s thoughts my own thoughts.

00:27:02.103 --> 00:27:06.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a bad tendency to try to do everything

00:27:06.141 --> 00:27:10.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by myself and to not
delegate things to others.

00:27:11.446 --> 00:27:15.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked myself,
‘What decision will please Jehovah?’

00:27:16.885 --> 00:27:20.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Make sure of the more important things.”

00:27:20.689 --> 00:27:22.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt the need to train

00:27:22.824 --> 00:27:24.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
younger brothers in the congregation

00:27:24.893 --> 00:27:28.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I could delegate
responsibilities to them.

00:27:28.363 --> 00:27:31.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The article encouraged us
to look to Bible principles.

00:27:31.499 --> 00:27:33.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And two that really helped me

00:27:33.702 --> 00:27:38.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were Proverbs 15:28 and Philippians 2:4

00:27:38.139 --> 00:27:41.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it helped me to think

00:27:41.543 --> 00:27:44.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what is in the person’s best interests

00:27:44.112 --> 00:27:46.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before I respond to them.

00:27:46.715 --> 00:27:50.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I took time when reading Bible accounts

00:27:50.051 --> 00:27:52.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to meditate on how I would feel

00:27:52.187 --> 00:27:55.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if I were one of those Bible characters.

00:27:58.493 --> 00:28:02.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can now explain things better
at my children’s study.

00:28:05.033 --> 00:28:08.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m very happy to see my children

00:28:08.336 --> 00:28:11.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
truly enjoying Christian activities.

00:28:11.172 --> 00:28:15.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My son started doing “play meetings” for fun.

00:28:15.176 --> 00:28:17.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My daughter loves the ministry.

00:28:17.679 --> 00:28:19.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She talks to people willingly,

00:28:19.814 --> 00:28:22.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not because we as parents
are telling her to do so.

00:28:22.717 --> 00:28:25.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Compared to how it was when I was a child,

00:28:25.754 --> 00:28:27.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
things are totally different now,

00:28:27.922 --> 00:28:31.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that really makes me happy.

00:28:31.559 --> 00:28:34.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By applying this principle,

00:28:34.095 --> 00:28:36.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can lighten my load

00:28:36.598 --> 00:28:39.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reduce my stress level.

00:28:39.868 --> 00:28:44.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In turn, that helps me to maintain joy,

00:28:44.072 --> 00:28:46.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to strengthen our relationship as a couple,

00:28:46.574 --> 00:28:49.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I feel I’ve become

00:28:49.043 --> 00:28:53.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more approachable
to those in the congregation.

00:28:53.782 --> 00:28:57.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having the “mind of Christ”
has helped me in my assignment 

00:28:57.285 --> 00:29:00.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it’s helped me to form
really close friendships 

00:29:00.121 --> 00:29:02.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the brothers and sisters
in my congregation, and that’s brought me

00:29:02.824 --> 00:29:04.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a lot of joy in my service.

00:29:04.959 --> 00:29:09.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also, when I don’t know
what to do (which often happens),

00:29:09.831 --> 00:29:13.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have Jehovah’s principles to guide me,

00:29:13.234 --> 00:29:15.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that makes me feel safe and secure.

00:29:31.953 --> 00:29:34.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Family heads, did you notice

00:29:34.689 --> 00:29:39.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how Yusuke took to heart
the suggestion to analyze his life

00:29:39.027 --> 00:29:41.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and look for ways to improve?

00:29:41.529 --> 00:29:44.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He realized
that while he had some Bible knowledge,

00:29:44.799 --> 00:29:48.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he needed to deepen it
through study and meditation.

00:29:48.303 --> 00:29:52.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That made him
a more effective teacher for his children.

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:56.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jane was doing fine work
as a pioneer in a foreign land.

00:29:56.511 --> 00:29:59.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, ironically, she had difficulty

00:29:59.414 --> 00:30:02.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with brothers and sisters
from different cultures.

00:30:02.217 --> 00:30:04.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we?

00:30:04.219 --> 00:30:06.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What stood in her way?

00:30:06.221 --> 00:30:09.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said, ‘I had to let go of my pride.’

00:30:09.457 --> 00:30:11.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once she did,

00:30:11.459 --> 00:30:14.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s thoughts became her thoughts.

00:30:14.429 --> 00:30:17.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps, like Yutaka Kimura,

00:30:17.165 --> 00:30:20.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re dealing
with changing life circumstances.

00:30:20.368 --> 00:30:22.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we learn from his example?

00:30:22.837 --> 00:30:27.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He delegated responsibilities
and reordered his priorities.

00:30:27.675 --> 00:30:29.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That took humility.

00:30:29.777 --> 00:30:34.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The result?
Reduced stress and increased joy.

00:30:34.782 --> 00:30:37.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Often, honest self-examination

00:30:37.952 --> 00:30:41.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reveals the root cause
of something we need to adjust.

00:30:41.322 --> 00:30:44.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see that
in the following dramatization.

00:31:00.008 --> 00:31:02.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I embarrassed my wife tonight.

00:31:06.281 --> 00:31:08.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew when it happened,

00:31:08.983 --> 00:31:12.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I didn’t want to talk about it.

00:31:28.836 --> 00:31:31.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I knew in my heart that Yoomi was right.

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:38.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had become unkind.

00:31:40.214 --> 00:31:42.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were lots of examples.

00:31:46.821 --> 00:31:50.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d complained about the way one brother
conducted meetings for field service.

00:31:56.297 --> 00:31:58.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was jealous

00:31:58.433 --> 00:32:02.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a ministerial servant
who received new privileges.

00:32:17.619 --> 00:32:19.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I was pretty blunt

00:32:19.621 --> 00:32:22.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how frustrated I got
with Yoomi’s parents.

00:32:31.199 --> 00:32:34.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought I’d gotten rid
of my old personality,

00:32:34.035 --> 00:32:37.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it still lurked inside of me.

00:32:41.576 --> 00:32:45.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of my friends
were OK with and even encouraged

00:32:45.079 --> 00:32:47.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these bad qualities.

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:51.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The change was so gradual

00:32:51.285 --> 00:32:54.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I didn’t even realize
how far I’d fallen.

00:32:55.657 --> 00:32:58.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think I need to do to change?

00:32:58.926 --> 00:33:00.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about we search
for “good for building up”

00:33:00.762 --> 00:33:02.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the ONLINE LIBRARY?

00:33:02.397 --> 00:33:04.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sounds good.
Let’s take a look.

00:33:11.506 --> 00:33:14.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We considered Ephesians 4:29,

00:33:14.842 --> 00:33:16.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which says:

00:33:16.244 --> 00:33:19.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let a rotten word
not come out of your mouth,

00:33:19.414 --> 00:33:21.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but only what is good
for building up . . . ,

00:33:21.749 --> 00:33:24.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to impart what is beneficial
to the hearers.”

00:33:28.189 --> 00:33:31.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was struck by this powerful word picture.

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:36.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rotten words are as disgusting

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:39.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as rotten food.

00:33:42.136 --> 00:33:44.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want the things
coming out of my mouth

00:33:44.505 --> 00:33:48.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to disgust my wife or anyone else.

00:33:48.142 --> 00:33:50.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to change,

00:33:50.278 --> 00:33:52.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed a plan.

00:33:54.816 --> 00:33:58.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I really try to think before I speak.

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I have a goal to give someone

00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:05.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
real commendation at every meeting.

00:34:14.068 --> 00:34:17.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a goal for my conversations too.

00:34:18.873 --> 00:34:21.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to keep them
wholesome, true, and kind.

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:28.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s amazing how speaking kindly to others

00:34:28.216 --> 00:34:32.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can make you feel so good inside.

00:34:36.390 --> 00:34:38.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I shouldn’t be surprised,

00:34:38.693 --> 00:34:42.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it’s just another way
of showing God’s love.

00:34:44.999 --> 00:34:49.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t think I’ll ever forget
that image of the rotten fruit.

00:34:49.504 --> 00:34:52.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But isn’t that the point?

00:34:52.006 --> 00:34:56.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one wants their words
and conversations to be like that.

00:34:56.511 --> 00:35:01.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to perfect holiness
with clean conversations.

00:35:01.282 --> 00:35:05.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we keep our speech
upbuilding and kind?

00:35:05.353 --> 00:35:09.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like our brother,
we need to look within ourselves.

00:35:09.223 --> 00:35:12.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s causing us to say hurtful things?

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:16.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He discovered
the “old personality” still lurking inside,

00:35:16.664 --> 00:35:18.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he realized that some of his friends

00:35:18.733 --> 00:35:22.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were actually
encouraging his critical attitude.

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:25.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he did more than analyze himself.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:29.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He made a plan and set goals.

00:35:29.377 --> 00:35:33.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As his thinking changed, so did his speech.

00:35:33.447 --> 00:35:38.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That drew people to him,
and he felt good inside.

00:35:38.386 --> 00:35:43.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As that brother realized,
sometimes even without noticing it,

00:35:43.391 --> 00:35:46.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could move backward spiritually.

00:35:46.627 --> 00:35:51.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to move forward, perfecting holiness.

00:35:51.432 --> 00:35:56.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll next hear from a brother
who took more than a step or two backward.

00:35:56.304 --> 00:36:01.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what helped him
regain his relationship with Jehovah.

00:36:10.084 --> 00:36:13.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My first contact
with the Witnesses was in my 20’s.

00:36:18.292 --> 00:36:21.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As my knowledge increased,
I made drastic changes.

00:36:21.529 --> 00:36:25.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I quit smoking
and stopped swearing and using drugs.

00:36:25.499 --> 00:36:27.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also changed my violent behavior.

00:36:27.535 --> 00:36:29.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I completely gave up martial arts,

00:36:29.604 --> 00:36:34.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then I was baptized
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:36:34.508 --> 00:36:36.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was an amazing day
that I will never forget.

00:36:44.051 --> 00:36:46.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shortly after my baptism,

00:36:46.287 --> 00:36:49.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I became quite involved
in my work at the theater.

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:53.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The environment there
was very immoral, you know.

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:55.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even after several loving warnings

00:36:55.363 --> 00:36:59.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from brothers in the congregation
advising me to look for another job,

00:36:59.066 --> 00:37:01.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I chose not to follow their advice.

00:37:01.402 --> 00:37:03.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d worked there for a long time,

00:37:03.404 --> 00:37:06.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I thought, ‘I can handle it.’

00:37:06.407 --> 00:37:08.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I was wrong.

00:37:08.509 --> 00:37:10.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My conscience became dull,

00:37:10.845 --> 00:37:14.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I committed
a serious sin against Jehovah.

00:37:18.886 --> 00:37:21.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I left the truth,

00:37:21.088 --> 00:37:23.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
several offers came my way.

00:37:23.157 --> 00:37:27.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I became a manager at a nightclub
that was open until six in the morning.

00:37:27.361 --> 00:37:30.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a lot of parties,
and it was a lot of drugs.

00:37:37.071 --> 00:37:38.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also resumed martial arts.

00:37:41.275 --> 00:37:43.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I came in contact with serious criminals

00:37:43.778 --> 00:37:47.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gradually became friends
with the most influential person

00:37:47.248 --> 00:37:49.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the criminal underworld in Oslo.

00:37:51.919 --> 00:37:56.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually,
I was imprisoned for my violent behavior.

00:37:58.693 --> 00:38:02.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A Christian movement
visited the prison where I was,

00:38:02.964 --> 00:38:07.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all of the inmates were invited
to an event where there would be cake served.

00:38:07.601 --> 00:38:09.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That sounded very interesting.

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:12.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was tempted by a cake.

00:38:12.473 --> 00:38:14.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They also played music.

00:38:14.742 --> 00:38:19.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But after a while, 
they started speaking in tongues,

00:38:19.046 --> 00:38:21.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I felt very uncomfortable.

00:38:21.649 --> 00:38:25.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want to be involved in that,
but I couldn’t get up.

00:38:25.453 --> 00:38:27.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though I was big and strong back then,

00:38:27.955 --> 00:38:30.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I physically couldn’t stand up from my chair.

00:38:30.591 --> 00:38:33.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve experienced a lot in my life,

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:37.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but at that moment,
I was genuinely scared.

00:38:37.064 --> 00:38:41.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I cried out to Jehovah,
and immediately I was released,

00:38:41.802 --> 00:38:44.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I was able to get up and leave.

00:38:44.805 --> 00:38:47.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This big man was now
in a fetal position, crying.

00:38:50.811 --> 00:38:55.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then I called my wife
and asked her to bring me a Bible

00:38:55.683 --> 00:38:57.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some literature.

00:38:57.351 --> 00:39:00.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to start studying again
and draw close to Jehovah.

00:39:04.792 --> 00:39:07.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The greatest challenge was prayer

00:39:07.762 --> 00:39:12.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to start communicating with Jehovah again
after being so far away from him,

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doing all these bad things.

00:39:14.802 --> 00:39:17.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, it was a long way to go.

00:39:20.141 --> 00:39:23.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One scripture I especially remember 

00:39:23.144 --> 00:39:25.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is Isaiah 1:18, where He says:

00:39:25.946 --> 00:39:30.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Come, now,
and let us set matters straight between us.”

00:39:30.985 --> 00:39:35.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That touched me deeply.

00:39:35.322 --> 00:39:40.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also says
that if ‘your sins are red like scarlet,’

00:39:40.327 --> 00:39:44.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will make them “white as snow.”

00:39:44.999 --> 00:39:49.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It felt like he separated the darkness
and stretched out his hand

00:39:49.203 --> 00:39:53.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pulled me out,
back into the light again.

00:39:59.146 --> 00:40:01.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Six months after I was reinstated,

00:40:01.115 --> 00:40:04.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my wife decided to dedicate her life

00:40:04.185 --> 00:40:06.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah and was baptized.

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:12.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She has been a huge support during my return.

00:40:14.428 --> 00:40:16.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was very nervous at first,

00:40:18.399 --> 00:40:21.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but when I entered the Kingdom Hall,

00:40:21.035 --> 00:40:23.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that feeling just disappeared.

00:40:23.604 --> 00:40:25.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s spirit is here.

00:40:25.873 --> 00:40:29.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The way the brothers and sisters
acted toward each other

00:40:29.777 --> 00:40:32.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was such a contrast to my former lifestyle.

00:40:37.518 --> 00:40:39.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We feel deeply blessed by Jehovah.

00:40:42.957 --> 00:40:45.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, you make mistakes once in a while,

00:40:45.926 --> 00:40:50.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now I feel confident
that Jehovah is merciful.

00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:59.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At his lowest point, Petter said

00:40:59.874 --> 00:41:03.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he felt ‘so far away from Jehovah.’

00:41:03.444 --> 00:41:07.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you can relate
to his situation in some way,

00:41:07.114 --> 00:41:11.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be assured that you too
can “set matters straight.”

00:41:11.752 --> 00:41:14.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can experience what Petter did

00:41:14.488 --> 00:41:19.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jehovah helped him
out of the darkness into the light again.

00:41:19.393 --> 00:41:23.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, Jehovah is saying to you

00:41:23.097 --> 00:41:27.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to all of us: ‘I see your potential.

00:41:27.268 --> 00:41:30.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have what it takes.’

00:41:30.004 --> 00:41:34.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, some of the greatest challenges
are faced by our young people.

00:41:34.708 --> 00:41:38.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This month’s music video
was made especially for them.

00:41:38.345 --> 00:41:42.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s entitled
<i>“Fight the Fine Fight of the Faith.”</i>

00:42:01.969 --> 00:42:14.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some days I feel I’ve had enough.
The war in my mind can get so tough.

00:42:14.248 --> 00:42:25.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s days I feel there’s no way out.
In a flood of tears, I’m sinking down.

00:42:25.759 --> 00:42:38.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my despair, he sees me through.
When I am crushed, I know just what to do.

00:42:38.239 --> 00:42:43.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need his words of truth.
I can hear Jehovah saying:

00:42:43.611 --> 00:42:55.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Just a little while longer,
And I will wipe out ev’ry tear.

00:42:55.589 --> 00:43:02.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Just a little while longer,
The new world is in sight.

00:43:02.863 --> 00:43:06.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Just keep on holding tight.

00:43:06.533 --> 00:43:13.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’ll help you win this fight—
Fight.

00:43:13.207 --> 00:43:17.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll help you win this fight.’

00:43:20.648 --> 00:43:26.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reading his Word
gives me the power.

00:43:26.053 --> 00:43:32.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When storms in life come,
he’s my strong Tower.

00:43:32.826 --> 00:43:44.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my despair, he pulls me through.
When I am down, I know just what to do.

00:43:44.338 --> 00:43:49.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need his words of truth.
I can hear Jehovah saying:

00:43:49.410 --> 00:44:01.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Just a little while longer,
And I will wipe out ev’ry tear.

00:44:01.922 --> 00:44:09.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Just a little while longer,
The new world is in sight.

00:44:09.296 --> 00:44:12.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Just keep on holding tight.

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:19.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’ll help you win this fight—

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:31.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’ll help you win this fight.
I’ll help you win this fight.

00:44:31.151 --> 00:44:36.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll help you win this fight.’

00:44:43.497 --> 00:44:50.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’ll help you win this fight,
Help you win this fight,

00:44:50.838 --> 00:44:55.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Help you win this fight.’

00:45:05.919 --> 00:45:16.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Just a little while longer,
And I will wipe out ev’ry tear.

00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:24.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Just a little while longer,

00:45:24.271 --> 00:45:33.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just keep on holding tight.
I’ll help you win this fight.’

00:45:34.481 --> 00:45:39.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful song
and a beautiful reminder!

00:45:39.186 --> 00:45:43.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah does help us
to win our “fight of the faith.”

00:45:43.424 --> 00:45:45.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In what ways?

00:45:45.426 --> 00:45:47.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we saw in the video, he helps us

00:45:47.694 --> 00:45:50.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through our family and fellow worshippers,

00:45:50.197 --> 00:45:54.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the ministry,
and through his Word, the Bible.

00:45:54.301 --> 00:45:57.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Preserving God’s Word and his personal name

00:45:57.738 --> 00:46:01.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been a fierce fight over many centuries

00:46:01.008 --> 00:46:03.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a fight that’s being won.

00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:08.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the subject of the Bible Museum
at world headquarters in Warwick, New York.

00:46:08.248 --> 00:46:11.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take a brief tour.

00:46:11.018 --> 00:46:15.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible is a modern-day treasure.

00:46:15.289 --> 00:46:19.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reveals the satisfying truth about God,

00:46:19.493 --> 00:46:22.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
life, and our hope for the future.

00:46:22.396 --> 00:46:26.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s more,
it contains another priceless treasure

00:46:26.667 --> 00:46:30.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—God’s personal name, Jehovah.

00:46:30.904 --> 00:46:34.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How Jehovah preserved his name
in the Holy Scriptures,

00:46:34.675 --> 00:46:39.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against all attempts to remove it,
is a fascinating story.

00:46:39.446 --> 00:46:42.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s told here in the Bible Museum

00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:45.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at world headquarters in Warwick.

00:46:45.085 --> 00:46:47.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take the tour.

00:46:47.321 --> 00:46:49.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the museum’s entry,

00:46:49.656 --> 00:46:53.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the divine name is shown in various languages

00:46:53.093 --> 00:46:57.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a total of 7,216 times.

00:46:57.764 --> 00:46:59.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s how many times it appears

00:46:59.967 --> 00:47:03.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the New World Translation
of the Holy Scriptures.

00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:08.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah always made his name known,
even to the very first humans.

00:47:08.141 --> 00:47:12.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Cain was born,
Eve declared:

00:47:12.045 --> 00:47:14.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have produced a male child

00:47:14.515 --> 00:47:17.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the help of Jehovah.”

00:47:17.217 --> 00:47:19.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that time,

00:47:19.353 --> 00:47:22.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people knew and used God’s name.

00:47:22.689 --> 00:47:27.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The oldest example
of the divine name in Hebrew letters

00:47:27.361 --> 00:47:32.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is on the Moabite Stone
from the ninth century B.C.E.

00:47:32.366 --> 00:47:36.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moabite King Mesha
boasted against Israel:

00:47:36.503 --> 00:47:39.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I took from it the vessels of Jehovah,

00:47:39.973 --> 00:47:43.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and offered them before Chemosh.”

00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:46.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s also evidence that in ancient times

00:47:46.647 --> 00:47:50.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s name was used in everyday life.

00:47:50.417 --> 00:47:54.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This silver scroll
from the seventh century B.C.E.

00:47:54.254 --> 00:47:56.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the earliest known inscription

00:47:56.757 --> 00:47:59.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a Bible text containing God’s name.

00:47:59.927 --> 00:48:01.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reads:

00:48:01.261 --> 00:48:04.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“May Jehovah bless you and keep you.

00:48:04.731 --> 00:48:07.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May Jehovah make his face to shine on you.”

00:48:07.935 --> 00:48:10.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most important, God’s name

00:48:10.671 --> 00:48:13.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was in ancient copies of the Bible text.

00:48:13.574 --> 00:48:15.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Fouad Papyrus

00:48:15.943 --> 00:48:18.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the first century B.C.E.

00:48:18.712 --> 00:48:21.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a fragment of the Greek Septuagint,

00:48:21.715 --> 00:48:23.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the first known translation

00:48:23.717 --> 00:48:25.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek.

00:48:27.287 --> 00:48:30.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s Deuteronomy 32:3:

00:48:30.891 --> 00:48:34.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For I will declare the name of Jehovah.”

00:48:35.362 --> 00:48:37.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although the text is in Greek,

00:48:37.531 --> 00:48:40.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the divine name is written in Hebrew.

00:48:40.567 --> 00:48:42.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Greek-speaking Jews

00:48:42.569 --> 00:48:45.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jesus’ day used the Septuagint.

00:48:45.739 --> 00:48:49.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when Jesus read and taught
from the Scriptures,

00:48:49.476 --> 00:48:51.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people heard him use the divine name.

00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:57.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, though,
by the third century C.E.,

00:48:57.150 --> 00:49:00.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s name was removed
from the Septuagint

00:49:00.454 --> 00:49:02.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and replaced with the title “Lord.”

00:49:02.656 --> 00:49:04.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As an example,

00:49:04.358 --> 00:49:06.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Vatican Codex

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:10.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the fourth century C.E.
includes the text

00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:14.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Greek Septuagint
but omits God’s name.

00:49:14.001 --> 00:49:18.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Deuteronomy 32:3 here reads:

00:49:18.138 --> 00:49:21.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For I will declare the name of the LORD.”

00:49:21.174 --> 00:49:22.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah

00:49:22.843 --> 00:49:25.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wouldn’t allow his name to be lost.

00:49:25.946 --> 00:49:29.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was never removed
from Hebrew copies of the Bible.

00:49:29.116 --> 00:49:31.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Aleppo Codex

00:49:31.118 --> 00:49:34.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was copied by Jewish scribes

00:49:34.154 --> 00:49:36.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
around the year 930 C.E.

00:49:36.356 --> 00:49:38.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same verse,

00:49:38.125 --> 00:49:42.629 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Deuteronomy 32:3, says in Hebrew:

00:49:42.629 --> 00:49:46.099 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“For I will declare the name of Jehovah.”

00:49:46.099 --> 00:49:48.101 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Still,

00:49:48.101 --> 00:49:51.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for centuries, most people didn’t have

00:49:51.304 --> 00:49:53.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a Bible in their own language,

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:56.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor one that contained God’s name.

00:49:57.444 --> 00:49:59.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Latin Vulgate,

00:49:59.446 --> 00:50:02.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
translated around 405 C.E.,

00:50:02.482 --> 00:50:04.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
omitted the divine name.

00:50:04.518 --> 00:50:07.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It became the official translation

00:50:07.254 --> 00:50:11.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Catholic Church for over 1,000 years.

00:50:11.491 --> 00:50:14.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But a new technology triggered events

00:50:14.628 --> 00:50:18.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would soon make
the Bible widely available

00:50:18.365 --> 00:50:20.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in fresh translations

00:50:20.367 --> 00:50:23.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that returned God’s name
to its rightful place.

00:50:23.837 --> 00:50:28.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About 1453, 
Johannes Gutenberg

00:50:28.341 --> 00:50:31.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
produced an important edition
of the Latin Vulgate.

00:50:31.144 --> 00:50:33.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the first Bible 

00:50:33.146 --> 00:50:35.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
printed using movable type.

00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:41.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is an original page
from a Gutenberg Bible.

00:50:41.154 --> 00:50:45.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While only some 180 Bibles were made,

00:50:45.258 --> 00:50:49.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his invention sparked a printing revolution.

00:50:49.229 --> 00:50:53.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just 20 years later,
Anton Koberger was printing

00:50:53.834 --> 00:50:56.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
up to 1,000 Bibles per run,

00:50:56.770 --> 00:51:00.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making it the first mass-produced Bible.

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:03.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On display is an original copy

00:51:03.376 --> 00:51:05.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the second edition

00:51:05.378 --> 00:51:09.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Koberger’s Latin Bible from 1477.

00:51:09.883 --> 00:51:12.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, in the early 1500’s,

00:51:12.953 --> 00:51:15.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bible scholars took a renewed interest

00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:18.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the original Bible languages.

00:51:18.191 --> 00:51:20.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the very first time,

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:24.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the original-language Hebrew
and Greek Scriptures were printed together.

00:51:25.799 --> 00:51:28.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the Complutensian Polyglot,

00:51:28.435 --> 00:51:32.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
printed between 1514 and 1517.

00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:34.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A polyglot is a book

00:51:34.975 --> 00:51:38.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with text in several languages
arranged in columns.

00:51:38.712 --> 00:51:41.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Complutensian Polyglot,

00:51:41.381 --> 00:51:43.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible text appears in Latin,

00:51:43.984 --> 00:51:47.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek.

00:51:47.788 --> 00:51:51.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Comparing the Hebrew text with the Latin,

00:51:51.291 --> 00:51:53.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
scholars could see where God’s name

00:51:53.627 --> 00:51:57.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had been replaced
in the Latin Vulgate with “LORD.”

00:51:59.132 --> 00:52:03.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But would seeing the divine name
in the original Hebrew text

00:52:03.236 --> 00:52:05.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lead Bible translators to restore

00:52:05.972 --> 00:52:08.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s name in their translations?

00:52:08.508 --> 00:52:11.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Indeed, some did!

00:52:11.244 --> 00:52:13.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1551,

00:52:13.847 --> 00:52:16.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sebastian Castellio published

00:52:16.316 --> 00:52:19.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his fresh Latin translation of the Bible.

00:52:19.519 --> 00:52:21.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He appears to be the first

00:52:21.822 --> 00:52:24.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to use God’s name consistently

00:52:24.024 --> 00:52:25.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a Latin translation

00:52:25.692 --> 00:52:27.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:52:27.694 --> 00:52:30.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Translations into other languages

00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:32.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were also using God’s name.

00:52:32.532 --> 00:52:36.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1530, William Tyndale

00:52:36.203 --> 00:52:38.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
published his English translation

00:52:38.538 --> 00:52:40.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Genesis through Deuteronomy.

00:52:40.607 --> 00:52:42.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the first time

00:52:42.609 --> 00:52:44.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the divine name appeared

00:52:44.611 --> 00:52:46.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in any English Bible.

00:52:46.847 --> 00:52:49.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The popular Reina-Valera Spanish Bible

00:52:49.649 --> 00:52:52.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was published in 1602.

00:52:52.352 --> 00:52:54.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It contains the divine name

00:52:54.487 --> 00:52:56.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
throughout the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:52:58.458 --> 00:53:02.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a rare original first edition

00:53:02.229 --> 00:53:04.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the English King James Version

00:53:04.564 --> 00:53:08.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Bible, published in 1611.

00:53:08.201 --> 00:53:10.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It uses the name Jehovah

00:53:10.237 --> 00:53:12.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in just four passages.

00:53:12.305 --> 00:53:15.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, the King James Version became

00:53:15.642 --> 00:53:18.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the most widely printed book in the world.

00:53:18.411 --> 00:53:20.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some 200 years later,

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:22.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Benjamin Boothroyd,

00:53:22.682 --> 00:53:25.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a minister and Hebrew scholar,

00:53:25.018 --> 00:53:28.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
set out to revise the King James Version.

00:53:28.255 --> 00:53:31.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His 1817 translation

00:53:31.324 --> 00:53:33.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the first English Bible

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:35.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to use the divine name throughout

00:53:35.729 --> 00:53:37.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:53:37.831 --> 00:53:40.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meanwhile, church missionaries

00:53:40.267 --> 00:53:43.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were taking the Bible to new lands.

00:53:43.603 --> 00:53:47.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But without the divine name,
people couldn’t distinguish

00:53:47.908 --> 00:53:50.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the God of the Bible
from their own false gods.

00:53:50.944 --> 00:53:53.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Bible translations

00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:55.715 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in many languages of Asia,

00:53:55.715 --> 00:53:58.051 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Africa, the Pacific islands,

00:53:58.051 --> 00:54:00.720 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the Americas included God’s name.

00:54:02.088 --> 00:54:05.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Chinese Delegate’s Version from 1854

00:54:05.525 --> 00:54:08.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is an example of a missionary Bible

00:54:08.295 --> 00:54:10.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that uses God’s name throughout

00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:12.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:54:12.866 --> 00:54:14.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, there was

00:54:14.868 --> 00:54:17.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one more place where God’s name

00:54:17.470 --> 00:54:20.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was not yet restored

00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:22.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:54:22.676 --> 00:54:25.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the Nuremberg Polyglot,

00:54:25.612 --> 00:54:29.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
published by Elias Hutter in 1599.

00:54:29.649 --> 00:54:32.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It contains the Christian Greek Scriptures

00:54:32.385 --> 00:54:35.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 12 languages, including Hebrew.

00:54:36.256 --> 00:54:37.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here,

00:54:37.757 --> 00:54:42.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John’s Gospel
quotes Psalm 118:26:

“Blessed is the one who comes

In his Hebrew translation of the Gospel,

from Psalms.

00:54:54.841 --> 00:54:59.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did this in many other places
in the Greek Scriptures.

00:54:59.012 --> 00:55:01.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Translators had a precedent

00:55:01.715 --> 00:55:05.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to use God’s name
in the Christian Greek Scriptures

00:55:05.919 --> 00:55:09.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the name appeared
in verses quoted from the Hebrew Scriptures.

English Bible to use God’s name

00:55:23.303 --> 00:55:25.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

The New World Translation
of the Holy Scriptures

00:55:32.779 --> 00:55:37.283 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was first published between 1950 and 1960.

00:55:37.283 --> 00:55:39.853 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Its translators benefited

00:55:39.853 --> 00:55:42.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the scholarly work of those before them

00:55:42.989 --> 00:55:47.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had chosen to preserve God’s name
in their Bible translations.

00:55:47.961 --> 00:55:51.297 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Today, the New World Translation

00:55:51.297 --> 00:55:53.333 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is available in whole or in part

00:55:53.333 --> 00:55:56.169 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in over 170 languages.

00:55:57.570 --> 00:55:59.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s name, Jehovah,

00:55:59.572 --> 00:56:03.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
belongs in the Holy Scriptures he inspired.

00:56:04.844 --> 00:56:08.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This gallery holds just a small part

00:56:08.348 --> 00:56:13.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the overwhelming evidence to this fact.

00:56:13.319 --> 00:56:17.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible is a precious gift from God,
teaching us

00:56:17.624 --> 00:56:20.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about his works, his qualities,

00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:22.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his loving purpose

00:56:22.762 --> 00:56:24.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for humankind.

00:56:24.764 --> 00:56:27.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He invites each of us to read it,

00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:30.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to draw close to him, and to know him

00:56:30.737 --> 00:56:34.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by his most holy name, Jehovah.

00:56:35.742 --> 00:56:37.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our program has focused

00:56:37.777 --> 00:56:41.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on “perfecting holiness in God’s fear.”

00:56:41.481 --> 00:56:45.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Perfecting holiness” may sound out of reach,

00:56:45.852 --> 00:56:49.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but remember, it’s a continuous process.

00:56:49.522 --> 00:56:52.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw this with those young men in Italy

00:56:52.325 --> 00:56:56.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who left behind
their violent and immoral ways.

00:56:56.229 --> 00:56:58.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with Jane, Yusuke, and Yutaka,

00:56:58.865 --> 00:57:02.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we saw experienced Christians who found ways 

00:57:02.402 --> 00:57:05.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to grow as spiritual people.

00:57:05.171 --> 00:57:07.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learned how to make
our speech more upbuilding

00:57:07.907 --> 00:57:11.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by examining our motives and associations.

00:57:13.146 --> 00:57:15.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Petter Heinrichs’ experience demonstrates

00:57:15.248 --> 00:57:19.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it’s possible
to return to Jehovah with His help.

00:57:19.052 --> 00:57:21.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, our music video reminds us

00:57:21.821 --> 00:57:23.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that despite the unique pressures

00:57:23.890 --> 00:57:26.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our young people face,

00:57:26.559 --> 00:57:28.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re winning the fight.

00:57:28.595 --> 00:57:30.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We close with a visit

00:57:30.897 --> 00:57:35.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico.

00:57:35.301 --> 00:57:40.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Secluded beaches, lush valleys, mountains

00:57:40.306 --> 00:57:42.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this beautiful island is home

00:57:42.642 --> 00:57:45.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to more than 3 million inhabitants

00:57:45.078 --> 00:57:49.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and nearly 24,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:57:49.082 --> 00:57:53.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But its location in the Caribbean
puts Puerto Rico in the path

00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:56.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of tropical storms and hurricanes.

00:57:56.422 --> 00:58:00.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the most powerful ever,
Hurricane Maria,

00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:02.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
struck two years ago.

00:58:02.495 --> 00:58:06.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lives were lost, and homes were destroyed.

00:58:06.032 --> 00:58:09.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The entire island
lost electricity for months.

00:58:09.669 --> 00:58:11.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To help with relief efforts,

00:58:11.804 --> 00:58:14.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thousands of brothers and sisters
from Puerto Rico

00:58:14.674 --> 00:58:18.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and from across the United States
branch territory volunteered.

00:58:18.778 --> 00:58:20.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They repaired and rebuilt

00:58:20.813 --> 00:58:25.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
106 Kingdom Halls, 2 Assembly Halls,

00:58:25.151 --> 00:58:29.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and more than 800 homes of our brothers.

00:58:30.123 --> 00:58:34.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Barahona Congregation,
located in the middle of the island,

00:58:34.327 --> 00:58:38.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was enjoying their circuit overseer visit
when the hurricane hit.

00:58:38.464 --> 00:58:41.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The body of elders and the circuit overseer

00:58:41.367 --> 00:58:43.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
immediately organized and reached out

00:58:43.937 --> 00:58:46.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to everyone in the congregation.

00:58:46.072 --> 00:58:48.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite the devastation,

00:58:48.408 --> 00:58:52.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Sunday meeting took place as scheduled.

00:58:53.379 --> 00:58:57.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, despite dealing
with challenging conditions for many months,

00:58:57.483 --> 00:59:01.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the congregation
didn’t cancel a single meeting.

00:59:01.387 --> 00:59:04.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Within a few days of Hurricane Maria,

00:59:04.123 --> 00:59:06.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the organized preaching work resumed

00:59:06.659 --> 00:59:09.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our brothers were back in the field.

00:59:09.162 --> 00:59:12.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The response has been encouraging.

00:59:12.699 --> 00:59:16.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fifty Bible studies are now being conducted.

00:59:17.737 --> 00:59:22.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The 117 publishers
in the Barahona Congregation
