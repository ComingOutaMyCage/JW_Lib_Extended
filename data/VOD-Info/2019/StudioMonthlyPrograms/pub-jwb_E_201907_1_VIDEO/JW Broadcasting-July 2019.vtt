Welcome to the program!

00:00:05.288 --> 00:00:07.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This month, 
we’ll take you to world headquarters

00:00:07.991 --> 00:00:10.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to visit one of the museums.

00:00:10.727 --> 00:00:14.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll learn about the many activities
that are organized and directed

00:00:14.464 --> 00:00:16.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the Governing Body today.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, how can we protect ourselves

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from being lured into sin?

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:25.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this dramatization,

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:27.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a young brother learns
how to make the right decision.

00:00:29.145 --> 00:00:31.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how does the organization
ensure that our brothers

00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:34.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sisters receive spiritual food?

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:37.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this example from Africa,

00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:40.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll see how JW Broadcasting® is distributed

00:00:40.924 --> 00:00:43.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when Internet connections are slow.

00:00:44.427 --> 00:00:48.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the July 2019 program

00:00:48.531 --> 00:00:51.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of JW Broadcasting!

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll begin by introducing you
to two sisters who live in the United States.

00:01:15.725 --> 00:01:17.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Early on in their lives,

00:01:17.727 --> 00:01:20.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were exposed to two very different views

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:22.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what a family should be like.

00:01:22.565 --> 00:01:25.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, they came to realize that,

00:01:25.135 --> 00:01:28.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while life may change, Jehovah doesn’t.

00:01:29.906 --> 00:01:32.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is my sister Lei Lei.

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:34.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is my sister Mimi.

00:01:34.377 --> 00:01:37.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My sister Lei Lei—
She is very caring.

00:01:37.914 --> 00:01:39.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know that for sure.

00:01:39.315 --> 00:01:41.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One thing that I appreciate about Mimi

00:01:41.317 --> 00:01:45.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that she has a self-sacrificing spirit.

00:01:45.688 --> 00:01:47.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love our family.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:48.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:01:51.928 --> 00:01:55.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What I love most about my mom
is that she has a big heart.

00:01:55.098 --> 00:01:59.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I know that my dad
really, truly loves his family.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our sister, Sophie, always takes care of you,
making sure you are OK.

00:02:04.073 --> 00:02:07.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our family is something
that we never want to replace.

00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:09.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To us, it’s a forever family.

00:02:14.484 --> 00:02:16.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it wasn’t always like that.

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:19.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We haven’t always been sisters.

00:02:20.323 --> 00:02:22.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At a young age,

00:02:22.358 --> 00:02:25.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was already in a foster home,

00:02:26.095 --> 00:02:28.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then Mimi became my foster sister.

00:02:28.865 --> 00:02:31.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were not treated as part of their family.

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:35.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We never knew what love felt like.

00:02:35.138 --> 00:02:37.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There wasn’t a bedroom for us.

00:02:37.507 --> 00:02:39.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Me and Lei Lei would share a couch.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our foster families would leave us

00:02:42.712 --> 00:02:44.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by ourselves at home,

00:02:45.315 --> 00:02:48.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and me and Lei Lei had to take care of ourselves.

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:51.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we were very close together

00:02:51.554 --> 00:02:55.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we would talk to each other
and just help each other out.

00:02:55.191 --> 00:02:58.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we would go to school,
we didn’t have school supplies,

00:02:58.528 --> 00:03:00.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I would steal stuff.

00:03:00.697 --> 00:03:03.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we didn’t have school uniforms;

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:06.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had clothing that was dirty.

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:09.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like in some way
that with all these experiences

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it kind of made me feel like I didn’t care.

00:03:11.908 --> 00:03:15.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t like authority figures
and didn’t really trust them.

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:17.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was lost.

00:03:17.347 --> 00:03:20.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was confused.

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:22.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just did whatever I possibly could

00:03:22.685 --> 00:03:24.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to protect myself.

00:03:24.754 --> 00:03:28.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have experienced things
that no child should go through.

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:34.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We found out there was a family
who wanted to adopt us.

00:03:34.998 --> 00:03:37.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was 12 years old.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I was nine years old.

00:03:39.802 --> 00:03:43.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One thing that was tough for me was conversing.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know any English,

00:03:46.776 --> 00:03:49.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was hard for my parents to know how I felt

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:53.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I had a hard time
expressing if I was sad or scared.

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:56.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had a difficult time trusting.

00:03:57.453 --> 00:03:59.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they showed us love,

00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:03.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they hugged us
and just made us feel at home.

00:04:05.295 --> 00:04:07.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I got to know them better and I got to see

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they truly loved me

00:04:09.866 --> 00:04:13.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that they truly treated me like their daughter,

00:04:13.136 --> 00:04:16.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it helped me to develop love and trust.

00:04:16.706 --> 00:04:20.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first time I saw
my mom and dad praying at the dinner meal,

00:04:20.076 --> 00:04:23.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was very new to me because I never knew

00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:26.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there was a God.

00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:30.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had some past experience with religion,
and I didn’t like it.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when I first saw my mom and dad praying,

00:04:33.323 --> 00:04:35.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was uncomfortable with it.

00:04:35.925 --> 00:04:37.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had to figure out a way

00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:39.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to introduce their best Friend,

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:42.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, to us.

00:04:42.632 --> 00:04:46.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They took us to this place
called the Kingdom Hall.

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first thing we felt was warmth and love.

00:04:50.606 --> 00:04:52.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All these friends were coming up

00:04:52.608 --> 00:04:55.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and saying hi to us and giving us hugs

00:04:55.678 --> 00:04:57.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—just super loving toward us.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dad would give us a notepad,

00:05:00.016 --> 00:05:03.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he would tell us,
“Draw anything that you understand.”

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so those were our notes.

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:07.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We would just draw pictures.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would pray with us,

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:13.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
teaching us how to pray specifically

00:05:13.363 --> 00:05:17.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to see how Jehovah
could answer our prayer.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We would eat breakfast
every day together and do the daily text;

00:05:21.237 --> 00:05:24.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would reenact Bible stories.

00:05:24.807 --> 00:05:27.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we prepared for meetings.

00:05:30.046 --> 00:05:34.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The simplified Watchtower came out,
and it really helped us so much.

00:05:34.517 --> 00:05:39.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to really learn
more about Jehovah and understand it.

00:05:39.122 --> 00:05:43.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that helped me to give
more comments and draw closer to Jehovah.

00:05:43.493 --> 00:05:45.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A big change for me

00:05:45.528 --> 00:05:48.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was during the 2014 international convention.

00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:50.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just seeing the love and the unity

00:05:50.833 --> 00:05:53.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between brothers and sisters touched my heart.

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:55.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That also helped me

00:05:55.505 --> 00:05:59.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to progress toward making
the decision of getting baptized.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Going out in service more—
I think it really helped me

00:06:03.679 --> 00:06:07.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to draw closer to Jehovah
and make the Kingdom feel real to me.

00:06:07.483 --> 00:06:11.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so that’s why I wanted to get baptized.

00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:15.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After I graduated from high school,
I started to pioneer.

00:06:15.758 --> 00:06:19.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s one way to show my love for Jehovah.

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:22.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I used to just take care of myself,

00:06:22.198 --> 00:06:26.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I learned to take care of others
and to think of others first.

00:06:26.702 --> 00:06:29.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For us young ones, we should appreciate

00:06:29.205 --> 00:06:31.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every moment that we have with our parents.

00:06:31.507 --> 00:06:33.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your parents are the best friends
that you could ever have.

00:06:34.577 --> 00:06:37.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Going out in service wasn’t easy for me at first

00:06:37.713 --> 00:06:40.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I’m actually a very shy person,

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:45.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I decided to rely on Jehovah
and started pioneering.

00:06:45.121 --> 00:06:47.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just recently,

00:06:47.223 --> 00:06:50.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started commuting to Bethel one day a week.

00:06:51.727 --> 00:06:56.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The important quality
that Jehovah has taught me is love

00:06:56.132 --> 00:07:01.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt that love from my family,
from Jehovah, and from my friends.

00:07:01.137 --> 00:07:05.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned that it’s OK to love people,
and that’s what you are supposed to do.

00:07:05.641 --> 00:07:08.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You love people and take care of people.

00:07:08.644 --> 00:07:12.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I feel like my life
is more satisfying and meaningful.

00:07:12.982 --> 00:07:17.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I meditate and think
about what Jehovah has done for me and Lei Lei,

00:07:17.753 --> 00:07:19.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t have to be afraid.

00:07:19.755 --> 00:07:23.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is my “secure refuge,”
because life may change,

00:07:23.359 --> 00:07:25.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah does not change.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:32.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The love and unity of the brothers
stood out to Lei Lei and Mimi

00:07:32.468 --> 00:07:35.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helped them draw closer to Jehovah.

00:07:35.838 --> 00:07:38.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a Bible student to progress to baptism,

00:07:38.841 --> 00:07:42.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he or she would need to develop
those very qualities,

00:07:42.044 --> 00:07:44.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which Lei Lei and Mimi did.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there are
many additional aspects of our personality

00:07:48.751 --> 00:07:51.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we as Christians need to maintain.

00:07:52.588 --> 00:07:54.590 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
One of the most underrated qualities

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.393 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in today’s world is modesty.

00:07:57.393 --> 00:07:59.462 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In fact, the world encourages

00:07:59.462 --> 00:08:02.064 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the exact opposite of modesty.

00:08:02.064 --> 00:08:06.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world says that you are
the most important person;

00:08:06.002 --> 00:08:10.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you should promote yourself;
you have no limits;

00:08:10.206 --> 00:08:13.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have the right to be anything you want to be.

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:18.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we’ll see, the world’s thinking
is completely backward

00:08:18.848 --> 00:08:21.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and for several reasons.

00:08:21.017 --> 00:08:23.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really, modesty is a quality

00:08:23.886 --> 00:08:26.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that stems from everything that is good.

00:08:27.456 --> 00:08:32.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our theme scripture
for this discussion is Micah 6:8:

00:08:33.196 --> 00:08:35.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He has told you . . . what is good.

00:08:35.898 --> 00:08:38.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And what is Jehovah requiring of you?

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:43.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Only to exercise justice, to cherish loyalty,

00:08:43.306 --> 00:08:47.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to walk in modesty with your God!”

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice that modesty is one

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:52.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the key aspects of “what is good.”

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:55.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To help us understand why,

00:08:55.051 --> 00:08:57.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s discuss three questions:

00:08:57.153 --> 00:08:59.589 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What is modesty?

00:08:59.589 --> 00:09:02.491 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Why do we want to have this quality?

00:09:02.491 --> 00:09:04.727 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
How can we cultivate it?

00:09:04.727 --> 00:09:07.430 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
First, what is modesty?

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:12.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Basically, it’s an awareness of our limitations.

00:09:12.935 --> 00:09:15.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we often link modesty

00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:17.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with appropriate dress and grooming,

00:09:17.506 --> 00:09:20.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but much more is involved.

00:09:20.243 --> 00:09:22.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we know?

00:09:22.245 --> 00:09:26.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider what we read at Proverbs 11:2:

00:09:26.115 --> 00:09:28.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When presumptuousness comes,

00:09:28.918 --> 00:09:30.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“dishonor will follow,

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but wisdom is with the modest ones.”

00:09:34.724 --> 00:09:37.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice that modesty is contrasted

00:09:37.093 --> 00:09:40.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a negative quality—presumptuousness.

00:09:40.563 --> 00:09:44.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A presumptuous person
runs ahead without the authority to do so.

00:09:45.368 --> 00:09:48.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He or she ignores
proper boundaries and limitations.

00:09:48.738 --> 00:09:53.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That kind of attitude
often leads to foolish mistakes

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:55.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a bad reputation with fellow humans.

00:09:55.711 --> 00:10:00.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And above all,
it can cause a person to lose God’s favor.

00:10:01.317 --> 00:10:04.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, we might think of King Saul.

00:10:04.654 --> 00:10:07.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although he started out as a modest young man,

00:10:07.757 --> 00:10:10.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in time he became presumptuous.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He even went so far as to offer up

00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:18.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a burnt sacrifice
even though he was not authorized to do so.

00:10:18.501 --> 00:10:20.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result,

00:10:20.503 --> 00:10:23.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saul lost Jehovah’s favor

00:10:23.239 --> 00:10:25.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and eventually the kingship.

00:10:25.408 --> 00:10:29.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Saul’s case, presumptuousness definitely

00:10:29.011 --> 00:10:31.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
led to dishonor.

00:10:31.013 --> 00:10:33.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand,

00:10:33.015 --> 00:10:35.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a wise and modest person

00:10:35.017 --> 00:10:39.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recognizes his limitations and works within them.

00:10:39.422 --> 00:10:43.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is modesty the course of wisdom?

00:10:43.359 --> 00:10:46.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This brings us to our second main point,

00:10:46.028 --> 00:10:49.065 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Why do we want to have this quality?

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:51.067 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The foremost reason

00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:53.803 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is that modesty is essential

00:10:53.803 --> 00:10:56.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pleasing our heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:10:56.672 --> 00:10:59.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although we don’t speak
of Jehovah as being modest,

00:10:59.809 --> 00:11:02.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even he works within certain limitations

00:11:02.578 --> 00:11:04.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he’s imposed on himself.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:09.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He teaches us by example
how to demonstrate this quality,

00:11:09.418 --> 00:11:12.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though it’s not one that he needs to display.

00:11:13.622 --> 00:11:18.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can we say that Jehovah
imposes limitations on himself?

00:11:18.627 --> 00:11:21.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider just one example:

00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:25.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll never violate
the gift of free will that he’s granted us.

00:11:25.901 --> 00:11:29.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will never force us to serve him

00:11:29.138 --> 00:11:33.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even though, of course,
he has the power to do so.

00:11:33.042 --> 00:11:36.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aren’t we grateful that he allows us to serve him

00:11:36.679 --> 00:11:38.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we choose to out of love

00:11:38.981 --> 00:11:41.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not because we are forced to?

00:11:42.685 --> 00:11:46.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah teaches us
to display modesty in other ways as well.

00:11:46.555 --> 00:11:50.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, we might think
of how he listened patiently

00:11:50.793 --> 00:11:54.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Abraham voiced his concerns
about Jehovah’s purpose

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or how Jehovah invited
the angels to suggest ways to fool Ahab

00:12:01.437 --> 00:12:05.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then authorized
one of their suggestions to be carried out.

00:12:06.542 --> 00:12:09.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the lesson for us?

00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:12.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Jehovah, who doesn’t need
input or help from anyone,

00:12:12.548 --> 00:12:15.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
patiently listens and delegates,

00:12:15.117 --> 00:12:17.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how much more should we do so

00:12:17.453 --> 00:12:21.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—especially since
we’re all so imperfect and limited!

00:12:21.357 --> 00:12:25.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you a family head
or an elder in the congregation,

00:12:25.327 --> 00:12:29.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or do you have
another responsible position in the organization?

00:12:29.498 --> 00:12:32.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, you can imitate Jehovah

00:12:32.535 --> 00:12:35.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by not micromanaging others.

00:12:35.471 --> 00:12:38.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be willing to delegate tasks to them

00:12:38.674 --> 00:12:40.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and listen to their suggestions.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:44.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imitate Jehovah’s example of dignifying others

00:12:44.513 --> 00:12:47.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wanting to help them succeed.

00:12:48.617 --> 00:12:50.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides pleasing Jehovah,

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have other good reasons to be modest.

00:12:53.956 --> 00:12:57.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Modesty helps us to be joyful.

00:12:57.026 --> 00:12:58.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?

00:12:58.727 --> 00:13:03.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By going hand in hand
with a related quality—gratitude.

00:13:03.432 --> 00:13:06.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A faithful brother who worked
in the Writing Department

00:13:06.635 --> 00:13:09.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for some 50 years was fond of saying,

00:13:09.638 --> 00:13:12.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Only a grateful person can be happy.”

00:13:13.476 --> 00:13:16.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re modestly aware of our limitations,

00:13:16.479 --> 00:13:18.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll be grateful and happy

00:13:18.914 --> 00:13:21.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the help that we receive from others.

00:13:21.784 --> 00:13:23.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:13:23.519 --> 00:13:25.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think of the leper who returned

00:13:25.521 --> 00:13:27.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to thank Jesus for healing him.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This man realized his limitations.

00:13:30.693 --> 00:13:34.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was very thankful that Jesus
had done something for him

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:37.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he could never have done on his own.

00:13:38.834 --> 00:13:41.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another reason to cultivate modesty

00:13:41.604 --> 00:13:45.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that it promotes good relationships with others.

00:13:45.474 --> 00:13:47.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s face it:

00:13:47.476 --> 00:13:50.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People aren’t usually drawn to those who think,

00:13:50.412 --> 00:13:52.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If I want something done right,

00:13:52.648 --> 00:13:54.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have to do it myself.’

00:13:56.051 --> 00:13:58.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they usually appreciate it when they’re shown

00:13:58.354 --> 00:14:00.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have confidence in them.

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:03.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This, in turn, draws them to us.

00:14:05.094 --> 00:14:08.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another way that modesty
promotes good relationships

00:14:08.597 --> 00:14:13.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that it helps us
to avoid comparing ourselves to others.

00:14:13.135 --> 00:14:15.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Comparing ourselves to others

00:14:15.838 --> 00:14:19.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is always a dangerous road to navigate.

00:14:19.408 --> 00:14:22.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just think, for example, of Jesus’ apostles

00:14:22.778 --> 00:14:26.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who argued many times
over who was the greatest

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:31.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or of Joseph’s brothers
and the terrible things they did

00:14:31.754 --> 00:14:34.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of being jealous of Joseph.

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:37.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A modest person doesn’t obsess

00:14:37.259 --> 00:14:41.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over his perceived rank in comparison with others.

00:14:41.397 --> 00:14:43.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this regard,

00:14:43.132 --> 00:14:45.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can remember the good example of Moses.

00:14:45.801 --> 00:14:47.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did he react when Jehovah

00:14:47.803 --> 00:14:50.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enabled some of his fellow Israelites

00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:53.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to begin acting as prophets alongside him?

00:14:53.809 --> 00:14:55.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses rejoiced,

00:14:55.878 --> 00:14:59.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
saying that he wished all
of Jehovah’s people were prophets.

00:15:00.482 --> 00:15:04.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses didn’t feel that he was
the only one who should have such a privilege.

00:15:05.921 --> 00:15:10.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, modesty promotes
good relationships with others

00:15:10.626 --> 00:15:14.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it prevents us
from bragging about our accomplishments

00:15:14.563 --> 00:15:17.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or drawing undue attention to ourselves,

00:15:17.566 --> 00:15:20.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which could stir up resentment in others.

00:15:21.604 --> 00:15:25.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now we know what modesty is
and why we want to have it.

00:15:25.441 --> 00:15:28.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This brings us to our third main point,

00:15:28.077 --> 00:15:32.581 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
How can we cultivate this beautiful quality?

00:15:32.581 --> 00:15:34.249 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
One thing we can do

00:15:34.249 --> 00:15:37.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to read and meditate on Bible examples

00:15:37.319 --> 00:15:41.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—both good and bad—
such as those we just discussed.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:44.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Other Bible examples include Daniel,

00:15:44.526 --> 00:15:46.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who modestly didn’t take credit

00:15:46.528 --> 00:15:50.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the interpretation
of King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream.

00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:52.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The lesson for us?

00:15:52.167 --> 00:15:55.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re privileged to have a teaching assignment

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:58.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or we enjoy a measure of success in the ministry,

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:02.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to give all the glory to Jehovah.

00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:04.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should modestly recognize

00:16:04.213 --> 00:16:06.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we couldn’t do these things without his help.

00:16:08.217 --> 00:16:11.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can also study the example of Jesus,

00:16:11.053 --> 00:16:13.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who didn’t even think of trying to grasp

00:16:13.455 --> 00:16:16.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for more authority than Jehovah had granted him.

00:16:16.792 --> 00:16:19.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philippians 2:6 tells us:

00:16:19.995 --> 00:16:23.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He . . . gave no consideration to a seizure,

00:16:23.165 --> 00:16:27.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
namely, that he should be equal to God.”

00:16:27.469 --> 00:16:29.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider how Jesus responded

00:16:29.471 --> 00:16:32.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when his disciples James
and John approached him

00:16:32.107 --> 00:16:35.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their mother
and asked for a privilege

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was beyond his authority to grant them.

00:16:38.747 --> 00:16:40.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus modestly acknowledged

00:16:40.849 --> 00:16:43.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that only Jehovah could decide

00:16:43.552 --> 00:16:47.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would sit at his right
and left hand in the Kingdom.

00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:50.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus respected his limitations.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:54.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are some other ways
we can cultivate modesty?

00:16:54.997 --> 00:16:57.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One is to apply the Bible’s counsel

00:16:57.466 --> 00:17:01.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found at 1 Corinthians 4:6:

00:17:01.136 --> 00:17:04.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not go beyond the things that are written.”

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:08.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This refers primarily
to ‘the things written’ in God’s Word.

00:17:08.477 --> 00:17:13.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By extension, the principle
also applies to the Scriptural direction

00:17:13.248 --> 00:17:16.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we receive from our publications.

00:17:16.085 --> 00:17:18.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When asked for advice,

00:17:18.087 --> 00:17:21.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would never want to impose our own opinion

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:24.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or simply give an answer off the top of our head.

00:17:24.727 --> 00:17:27.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, we want to direct attention

00:17:27.429 --> 00:17:29.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the counsel found in the Bible

00:17:29.565 --> 00:17:31.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Bible-based publications.

00:17:32.768 --> 00:17:35.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another way we can cultivate modesty

00:17:35.604 --> 00:17:37.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is by asking for frank comments

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a trusted friend

00:17:39.842 --> 00:17:44.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as to whether or not
we have a reputation for being modest.

00:17:44.313 --> 00:17:48.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this regard, we remember the Bible principle:

00:17:48.517 --> 00:17:50.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As iron sharpens iron,

00:17:50.953 --> 00:17:54.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so one man sharpens his friend.”

00:17:54.556 --> 00:17:56.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If someone is willing to offer

00:17:56.558 --> 00:17:59.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
kind observations about how we can improve,

00:17:59.361 --> 00:18:02.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we wouldn’t want to bristle at the comments.

00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:07.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Granted, it may sting our pride
to hear such honest feedback,

00:18:07.202 --> 00:18:11.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but don’t we all need
to hear these things from time to time?

00:18:11.373 --> 00:18:13.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As imperfect humans,

00:18:13.375 --> 00:18:16.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each one of us has blind spots, as it were.

00:18:16.945 --> 00:18:20.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s hard to see ourselves the way others see us.

00:18:20.883 --> 00:18:25.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, we can work
to improve our Christian personality

00:18:25.721 --> 00:18:30.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—but only if we know
the areas that could use some improvement.

00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:33.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can’t change what we don’t see.

00:18:33.629 --> 00:18:35.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A word of caution:

00:18:35.631 --> 00:18:38.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to beware of false modesty.

00:18:38.534 --> 00:18:42.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember that it’s not
about simply appearing modest

00:18:42.271 --> 00:18:45.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but actually being modest at heart.

00:18:45.841 --> 00:18:48.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To help us examine ourselves,

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:51.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we might meditate on questions like these:

00:18:51.713 --> 00:18:54.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I receive advice or counsel,

00:18:54.416 --> 00:18:57.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how do I really feel about it at heart?

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:01.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does my internal reaction
depend on whether the person giving it

00:19:01.924 --> 00:19:06.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has less or more experience
or authority than I do?

00:19:06.361 --> 00:19:11.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Am I willing to accept valid suggestions
regardless of who offers them?

00:19:12.534 --> 00:19:15.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A final way we can develop true modesty

00:19:15.103 --> 00:19:18.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to ask Jehovah to help us.

00:19:18.207 --> 00:19:22.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know what James 1:17 says:

00:19:22.778 --> 00:19:27.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Every good gift and every perfect present is from above,

00:19:27.783 --> 00:19:31.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
coming down from the Father of the celestial lights.”

00:19:32.654 --> 00:19:36.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since modesty is one of Jehovah’s good gifts to us,

00:19:36.391 --> 00:19:39.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can be sure that if we pray to Jehovah and ask him

00:19:39.761 --> 00:19:42.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us cultivate this quality,

00:19:42.297 --> 00:19:44.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’ll answer our sincere prayers.

00:19:45.901 --> 00:19:48.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In review, what is modesty?

00:19:48.937 --> 00:19:52.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a proper recognition of our limitations.

00:19:52.774 --> 00:19:55.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do we want to have this quality?

00:19:55.544 --> 00:19:57.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because it pleases Jehovah,

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:01.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it promotes good relationships with others,

00:20:01.083 --> 00:20:04.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it adds to our joy.

00:20:04.019 --> 00:20:06.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we cultivate modesty?

00:20:06.655 --> 00:20:08.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many ways:

00:20:08.657 --> 00:20:12.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can meditate on Bible examples,
both good and bad,

00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:16.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then apply the lessons in our own life.

00:20:16.398 --> 00:20:20.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should apply the counsel
to ‘not go beyond the things written.’

00:20:20.569 --> 00:20:23.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can ask others for honest feedback

00:20:23.138 --> 00:20:25.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on how we’re doing in showing this quality.

00:20:25.707 --> 00:20:28.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And above all, we can pray to Jehovah

00:20:28.844 --> 00:20:31.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ask him to help us develop it more fully.

00:20:32.848 --> 00:20:35.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we think of all the positive ways

00:20:35.384 --> 00:20:38.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that modesty benefits ourselves and others,

00:20:38.287 --> 00:20:41.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wouldn’t you agree that it truly is a quality

00:20:41.023 --> 00:20:43.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that comes from “what is good”?

00:20:43.926 --> 00:20:47.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Modesty can also protect us
from Satan’s schemes.

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:50.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this dramatization,

00:20:50.032 --> 00:20:54.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a brother’s modesty
helped him to make the right decision.

00:21:06.982 --> 00:21:09.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom has been working hard lately,

00:21:09.651 --> 00:21:13.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I wish she worked harder for Jehovah.

00:21:13.689 --> 00:21:16.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I try to help out where I can.

00:21:24.633 --> 00:21:29.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, by the way, I’m Jin.

00:21:29.237 --> 00:21:31.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every day starts the same.

00:21:32.841 --> 00:21:34.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I grab a drink of water;

00:21:37.079 --> 00:21:40.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I say hi to Jun (he’s in my congregation);

00:21:42.017 --> 00:21:45.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then there’s Mee-Kyong.

00:21:46.521 --> 00:21:48.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.
Here we go.

00:21:48.523 --> 00:21:50.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I say hello,

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:53.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she says something clever,

00:21:53.228 --> 00:21:54.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I try to leave.

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:57.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is different.

00:21:57.733 --> 00:22:01.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s having trouble
in math and needs my help.

00:22:05.307 --> 00:22:07.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t want to be rude,

00:22:07.576 --> 00:22:08.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but

00:22:10.112 --> 00:22:12.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if I help her with her homework,

00:22:12.447 --> 00:22:15.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how far could the relationship develop?

00:22:15.617 --> 00:22:18.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you say no to a girl like her?

00:22:50.285 --> 00:22:53.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can’t I get her out of my head?

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:17.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Things are always better

00:23:17.012 --> 00:23:19.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Uncle and Auntie are around.

00:23:20.649 --> 00:23:24.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even Mom makes sure
she’s home for “dinner and broadcast” night.

00:23:32.961 --> 00:23:36.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uncle wants to work together
in service this weekend;

00:23:36.965 --> 00:23:39.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe that will help clear my head.

00:24:09.364 --> 00:24:12.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah must be disappointed in me.

00:24:14.035 --> 00:24:16.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t take it anymore.

00:24:16.638 --> 00:24:18.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was difficult,

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:22.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I told Uncle everything.

00:24:23.812 --> 00:24:27.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt guilty that I knew I shouldn’t,

00:24:27.716 --> 00:24:29.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I liked the attention.

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:35.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read Genesis 39:7-12.

00:24:36.925 --> 00:24:39.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew the account about Potiphar’s wife,

00:24:39.794 --> 00:24:43.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he mentioned something
I hadn’t thought of before.

00:24:43.732 --> 00:24:45.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He told Potiphar’s wife:

00:24:47.002 --> 00:24:50.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How could I commit this great badness

00:24:50.071 --> 00:24:53.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and actually sin against God?”

00:24:54.109 --> 00:24:57.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why did Joseph have to flee?

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph fought her every day,

00:25:07.189 --> 00:25:10.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she wasn’t going to give up.

00:25:10.225 --> 00:25:15.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In her mind,
it wasn’t a question of if but when.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:18.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There came a point when he had to flee.

00:25:23.471 --> 00:25:26.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I explained why I was ending the relationship,

00:25:26.675 --> 00:25:29.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she would not give up.

00:25:40.956 --> 00:25:44.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know the last thing she said to me?

00:25:44.259 --> 00:25:46.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That I was a coward.

00:25:46.494 --> 00:25:48.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But she’s wrong.

00:25:49.397 --> 00:25:52.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re never a coward if you run to Jehovah.

00:25:53.802 --> 00:25:56.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our young brother 
saw that dating an unbeliever

00:25:56.938 --> 00:25:59.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would put him in harm’s way.

00:25:59.441 --> 00:26:01.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was reminded that getting involved

00:26:01.743 --> 00:26:04.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with someone
who doesn’t share Jehovah’s values

00:26:04.646 --> 00:26:07.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could eventually lead to sin.

00:26:07.249 --> 00:26:11.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having modesty protected him
from such dire consequences.

00:26:12.654 --> 00:26:14.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By his decision,

00:26:14.656 --> 00:26:18.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could see our young brother’s faith in action.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:22.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith in Action
is also the name of one of the museums

00:26:22.364 --> 00:26:25.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at our world headquarters in Warwick, New York.

00:26:25.634 --> 00:26:28.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you had an opportunity to visit?

00:26:28.603 --> 00:26:32.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If not, we’d like to take you there right now.

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:36.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even if you have visited,
you’ll enjoy these reminders.

00:27:04.773 --> 00:27:06.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome to the World Headquarters

00:27:06.975 --> 00:27:10.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s Witnesses at Warwick, New York.

00:27:10.345 --> 00:27:12.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Jehovah’s people,

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:15.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are multicultural and multilingual.

00:27:15.617 --> 00:27:19.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as the artwork here emphasizes, our focus

00:27:19.654 --> 00:27:22.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is on our commission to ‘preach the good news

00:27:22.691 --> 00:27:25.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to people of all nations.’

00:27:25.694 --> 00:27:29.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what are we doing today as an organization?

00:27:29.064 --> 00:27:31.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did we get here?

00:27:31.066 --> 00:27:34.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what’s our main tool for this great work?

00:27:34.336 --> 00:27:37.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We invite you to come tour our museums

00:27:37.472 --> 00:27:39.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find out.

00:27:39.741 --> 00:27:42.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have three museums here at Warwick,

00:27:42.177 --> 00:27:46.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all funded by voluntary donations.

00:27:46.314 --> 00:27:49.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each of them is alive with stories.

00:27:49.584 --> 00:27:51.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Upstairs on the second floor

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the museum Faith in Action.

00:27:55.523 --> 00:27:58.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There we’ll see the very latest

00:27:58.026 --> 00:28:01.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on what’s being done by Jehovah’s organization.

00:28:01.396 --> 00:28:04.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also on the second floor is the museum

00:28:04.432 --> 00:28:07.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A People for Jehovah’s Name.

00:28:07.535 --> 00:28:11.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes us on an exciting journey back in time.

00:28:11.573 --> 00:28:13.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And downstairs

00:28:13.575 --> 00:28:16.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have the Bible Museum.

00:28:16.077 --> 00:28:18.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There we’ll get to see up close

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a spiritual treasure chest.

00:28:21.449 --> 00:28:25.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you tour the museums,
you’ll notice that they

00:28:25.019 --> 00:28:28.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were designed to be, not passive, but interactive

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:32.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you can put yourself in the experience.

00:28:32.527 --> 00:28:34.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So with that preview,

00:28:34.729 --> 00:28:36.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s take the tour.

00:28:41.936 --> 00:28:45.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the launching point
to the Faith in Action Museum.

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:50.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Note that important, descriptive word: “action.”

00:28:51.246 --> 00:28:53.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What activities, or actions,

00:28:53.715 --> 00:28:55.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are being organized and directed

00:28:55.817 --> 00:28:58.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the Governing Body today?

00:28:58.052 --> 00:29:00.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This display acquaints you right away

00:29:00.422 --> 00:29:03.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the work of the Governing Body committees.

00:29:03.124 --> 00:29:06.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each committee has specific responsibilities,

00:29:06.828 --> 00:29:09.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but as you take the tour,

00:29:09.431 --> 00:29:12.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how the committees work together

00:29:12.434 --> 00:29:14.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to accomplish their goals.

00:29:14.602 --> 00:29:17.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Faith in Action Museum

00:29:17.238 --> 00:29:19.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is divided into four galleries:

00:29:19.607 --> 00:29:21.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Show Love,”

00:29:21.109 --> 00:29:23.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Meet Together,”

00:29:23.812 --> 00:29:26.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Take In Spiritual Food,”

00:29:26.448 --> 00:29:28.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “Make Disciples.”

00:29:28.316 --> 00:29:29.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you walk through the galleries,

00:29:29.984 --> 00:29:34.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how each of them
is connected by a JW-blue ribbon.

00:29:34.622 --> 00:29:36.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you get lost,

00:29:36.624 --> 00:29:38.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just follow the blue ribbon.

00:29:40.929 --> 00:29:43.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the “Show Love” Gallery.

00:29:43.097 --> 00:29:45.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you’ll learn how the Governing Body

00:29:45.467 --> 00:29:48.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps God’s people
to ‘have love among themselves,’

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:53.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Jesus commanded at John 13:35.

00:29:53.107 --> 00:29:54.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:29:54.342 --> 00:29:57.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how do the brothers at headquarters respond

00:29:57.345 --> 00:30:00.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to needs that arise when a disaster strikes?

00:30:00.915 --> 00:30:03.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When things like natural disasters,

00:30:03.685 --> 00:30:07.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
terrorist attacks, or civil unrest occur,

00:30:07.689 --> 00:30:11.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Coordinators’ Committee directs relief efforts.

00:30:11.326 --> 00:30:14.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They, in turn, communicate
with the Branch Committee

00:30:14.562 --> 00:30:16.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that oversees the affected area.

00:30:16.898 --> 00:30:19.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Usually, within 48 hours,

00:30:19.901 --> 00:30:22.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a report of what’s occurred

00:30:22.337 --> 00:30:24.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what’s being done to help our brothers

00:30:24.706 --> 00:30:27.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is compiled and sent to headquarters.

00:30:27.842 --> 00:30:31.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That report may be
the basis for informing the brotherhood

00:30:31.546 --> 00:30:35.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through an article on jw.org®.

00:30:35.517 --> 00:30:39.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s another way that love
is shown to Jehovah’s people

00:30:39.921 --> 00:30:41.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—schools.

00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:44.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such schools as the School for Congregation Elders

00:30:44.826 --> 00:30:48.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the School for Circuit Overseers and Their Wives.

00:30:48.563 --> 00:30:51.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These have been very effective in training brothers

00:30:51.766 --> 00:30:54.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to shepherd the congregations lovingly.

00:30:56.337 --> 00:30:59.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Teaching Committee
is responsible for the curriculum,

00:30:59.507 --> 00:31:04.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while the Service Committee
arranges for the selection of the students.

00:31:04.045 --> 00:31:07.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the “Meet Together” Gallery.

00:31:07.715 --> 00:31:11.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you’ll learn how
the Governing Body is helping God’s people

00:31:11.619 --> 00:31:14.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to meet together “to incite

00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:17.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to love and fine works,” as directed

00:31:17.292 --> 00:31:20.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Hebrews 10:24, 25.

00:31:20.628 --> 00:31:25.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How is the headquarters staff
at Warwick filling that need?

00:31:25.099 --> 00:31:27.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because we keep growing,

00:31:27.535 --> 00:31:29.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s an ongoing need

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:32.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build new Kingdom Halls
and to renovate existing ones.

00:31:33.408 --> 00:31:36.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Publishing Committee of the Governing Body

00:31:36.144 --> 00:31:39.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
directs where Kingdom Halls will be built

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:42.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and makes funds available to the branches.

00:31:42.216 --> 00:31:44.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Publishing Committee

00:31:44.252 --> 00:31:46.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
works closely with the branch office,

00:31:46.788 --> 00:31:49.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its Local Design/Construction Department

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:51.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
carries out the work.

00:31:51.292 --> 00:31:53.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But where do these hardworking

00:31:53.294 --> 00:31:55.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brothers and sisters come from?

00:31:55.296 --> 00:31:57.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Personnel Committee

00:31:57.298 --> 00:31:59.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
appoints all construction servants

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for assignments in their home country

00:32:01.502 --> 00:32:04.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or in a foreign land.

00:32:04.038 --> 00:32:07.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you worked on a theocratic building project?

00:32:07.442 --> 00:32:09.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take our survey, and let us know.

00:32:11.346 --> 00:32:13.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some Kingdom Halls are located in areas

00:32:13.615 --> 00:32:16.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where there is little or no electricity,

00:32:16.584 --> 00:32:20.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that doesn’t stop us from meeting together.

00:32:20.121 --> 00:32:22.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Publishing Committee

00:32:22.423 --> 00:32:25.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has arranged for a custom-built, portable sound system

00:32:25.927 --> 00:32:28.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be used in these areas.

00:32:28.529 --> 00:32:31.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The unity player has a battery

00:32:31.165 --> 00:32:34.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can be recharged by its solar panel

00:32:34.035 --> 00:32:36.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or with a built-in hand crank.

00:32:36.804 --> 00:32:39.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a wonderful provision

00:32:39.273 --> 00:32:42.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that helps our brothers and sisters benefit more

00:32:42.176 --> 00:32:44.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from their congregation meetings.

00:32:44.779 --> 00:32:48.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the “Take In Spiritual Food” Gallery.

00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:51.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you guess what design we used?

00:32:51.119 --> 00:32:54.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right, a dining table.

00:32:54.155 --> 00:32:56.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you’ll learn how the Governing Body

00:32:56.457 --> 00:32:58.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fulfills the Scriptural commission

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Luke 12:42

00:33:00.895 --> 00:33:04.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to feed God’s people spiritually.

00:33:04.198 --> 00:33:06.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To accomplish this,

00:33:06.234 --> 00:33:09.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
millions of Bibles, books,

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:10.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other publications

00:33:10.905 --> 00:33:14.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
need to be prepared, translated, and printed.

00:33:14.676 --> 00:33:16.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition,

00:33:16.678 --> 00:33:20.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a regular flow of material is released online.

00:33:20.415 --> 00:33:22.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Translators around the world

00:33:22.417 --> 00:33:25.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keep in close contact with Translation Services

00:33:25.887 --> 00:33:27.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a headquarters department

00:33:27.889 --> 00:33:30.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s supervised by the Writing Committee.

00:33:30.858 --> 00:33:33.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have a favorite publication?

00:33:33.928 --> 00:33:37.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Much more is involved than just the writing.

00:33:37.565 --> 00:33:40.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The section “From Start to Finish”

00:33:40.435 --> 00:33:43.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
outlines 11 steps

00:33:43.004 --> 00:33:46.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are taken to produce the final product.

00:33:46.207 --> 00:33:49.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about our online spiritual food?

00:33:49.277 --> 00:33:52.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each month, we look forward

00:33:52.046 --> 00:33:55.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a new JW Broadcasting® program.

00:33:55.183 --> 00:33:59.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once the Teaching Committee approves a video idea,

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:02.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Audio/Video Services researches the subject

00:34:02.557 --> 00:34:06.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prepares a script for final approval.

00:34:06.327 --> 00:34:08.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Approved scripts and storyboards

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:12.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are assigned
to video production teams around the world.

00:34:12.567 --> 00:34:16.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This gives our videos an international flavor.

00:34:17.772 --> 00:34:22.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’ve come
to our final gallery, “Make Disciples.”

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:26.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you’ll learn how
the Governing Body is helping us

00:34:26.114 --> 00:34:28.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to fulfill the Scriptural commission

00:34:28.382 --> 00:34:30.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Matthew 28:19

00:34:30.785 --> 00:34:32.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “make disciples of people

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:35.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of all [the] nations, baptizing them.”

00:34:36.724 --> 00:34:39.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The command to preach can be daunting,

00:34:39.427 --> 00:34:41.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially in certain lands.

00:34:41.796 --> 00:34:44.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how are we meeting that challenge?

00:34:44.732 --> 00:34:47.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Service Committee oversees

00:34:47.401 --> 00:34:49.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the preaching work worldwide.

00:34:49.637 --> 00:34:53.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They help all to have a share according to their ability

00:34:53.274 --> 00:34:55.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—some as congregation publishers,

00:34:55.676 --> 00:34:59.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
others as full-time evangelizers.

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:02.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally, special preaching campaigns

00:35:02.483 --> 00:35:06.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and public witnessing
have resulted in many new Bible studies.

00:35:06.954 --> 00:35:08.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, though,

00:35:08.956 --> 00:35:10.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our religious freedom

00:35:10.992 --> 00:35:13.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is opposed by secular authorities.

00:35:13.161 --> 00:35:17.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the Coordinators’ Committee supervises

00:35:17.265 --> 00:35:20.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the World Headquarters Legal Department.

00:35:20.101 --> 00:35:23.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many courts have handed down favorable decisions.

00:35:23.871 --> 00:35:26.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, we must continue

00:35:26.474 --> 00:35:29.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to defend our right to preach the good news.

00:35:31.245 --> 00:35:36.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our online tools are also
a huge help in making disciples.

00:35:36.117 --> 00:35:39.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This counter shows the average rate

00:35:39.654 --> 00:35:41.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at which people worldwide

00:35:41.689 --> 00:35:44.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are logging on to jw.org.®

00:35:44.358 --> 00:35:48.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each day, some 250 Bible studies

00:35:48.763 --> 00:35:50.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are requested online.

00:35:50.998 --> 00:35:54.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Schools also help us to make disciples.

00:35:54.869 --> 00:35:57.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have the Pioneer Service School,

00:35:57.638 --> 00:35:59.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers,

00:35:59.874 --> 00:36:01.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Gilead School.

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:05.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you attended one of these schools?

00:36:05.646 --> 00:36:07.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us know.

00:36:08.416 --> 00:36:11.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as we come to the end of our tour,

00:36:11.419 --> 00:36:13.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we hope you enjoyed some highlights

00:36:13.588 --> 00:36:16.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from this Faith in Action Museum.

00:36:16.757 --> 00:36:19.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we’ve seen here reminds us

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that now and always

00:36:21.929 --> 00:36:25.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people are a people of faith

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:28.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—faith in action!

00:36:30.404 --> 00:36:32.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Brother Sanderson highlighted,

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:35.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the organization’s actions speak volumes

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:38.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the faith of Jehovah’s people.

00:36:38.412 --> 00:36:43.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we wanted to share
one more example of faith in action.

00:36:43.317 --> 00:36:47.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Africa, a new provision has made it easier

00:36:47.154 --> 00:36:51.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our brothers and sisters
to access spiritual food.

00:36:54.762 --> 00:36:56.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of the electronic information

00:36:56.764 --> 00:36:59.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that had been translated and provided

00:36:59.634 --> 00:37:01.469 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for the brothers in sub-Saharan Africa

00:37:01.469 --> 00:37:03.170 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was essentially unavailable to them.

00:37:04.605 --> 00:37:06.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many areas in Mozambique

00:37:06.974 --> 00:37:08.542 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that do not have Internet access,

00:37:08.542 --> 00:37:09.777 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and in some parts

00:37:09.777 --> 00:37:11.879 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
there is no cell phone coverage.

00:37:11.879 --> 00:37:13.881 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So we started investigating

00:37:13.881 --> 00:37:16.851 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
what it would take to have a 24-hour-a-day,

00:37:16.851 --> 00:37:19.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
7-day-a-week satellite channel

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:21.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dedicated to JW Broadcasting®.

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:24.692 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When the announcement was made to our congregation

00:37:24.692 --> 00:37:26.694 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about the JW satellite channel,

00:37:26.694 --> 00:37:29.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers and sisters
were very happy about the announcement.

00:37:32.133 --> 00:37:33.968 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Our organization has a lot of experience

00:37:33.968 --> 00:37:36.137 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
distributing video via the Internet,

00:37:36.137 --> 00:37:38.639 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but to distribute it on the satellite was entirely new,

00:37:38.639 --> 00:37:40.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we had to do a lot of research.

00:37:40.675 --> 00:37:42.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t have our own satellite up in space.

00:37:43.377 --> 00:37:47.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We rent a channel on a satellite
that covers sub-Saharan Africa.

00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:51.052 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What is required from the brothers is

00:37:51.052 --> 00:37:53.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have a satellite dish and a decoder.

00:37:54.221 --> 00:37:57.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This will allow them
to view the channel with no additional cost.

00:38:05.099 --> 00:38:06.767 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The brothers that are invited

00:38:06.767 --> 00:38:08.402 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to come here are trained.

00:38:08.402 --> 00:38:10.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, how to set up the dish.

00:38:10.838 --> 00:38:13.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, how to set up the decoder

00:38:13.841 --> 00:38:16.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and learn how to adjust the dish properly

00:38:16.877 --> 00:38:18.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that it works well.

00:38:18.879 --> 00:38:21.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, we teach them how to record the programs

00:38:21.082 --> 00:38:25.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the goal that they can watch it
with the brothers and sisters in the congregation.

00:38:28.055 --> 00:38:30.124 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Our satellite channel is set up to transmit

00:38:30.124 --> 00:38:33.194 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
one video track and 16 audio tracks.

00:38:33.194 --> 00:38:36.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This gives us the ability to broadcast our videos

00:38:36.097 --> 00:38:38.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 16 languages.

00:38:38.265 --> 00:38:41.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We consulted
with the Translation Services Department,

00:38:41.035 --> 00:38:43.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so these are the 16 languages

00:38:43.037 --> 00:38:47.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that give us the greatest audience
of our brothers in Africa.

00:38:47.575 --> 00:38:51.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We wrote new software that takes
any new video that comes to JW Broadcasting®

00:38:51.779 --> 00:38:56.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and mixes the 16 languages
of video together into a single video file

00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:58.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and delivers that to our satellite provider.

00:38:58.052 --> 00:39:00.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body

00:39:00.054 --> 00:39:03.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lovingly approved
for the rental cost of the satellite channel

00:39:03.758 --> 00:39:07.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be covered
from contributions to the worldwide work.

00:39:07.161 --> 00:39:09.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there’s no expense to the brothers

00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:11.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Africa to receive the program.

00:39:11.999 --> 00:39:14.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We broadcast over

00:39:14.235 --> 00:39:17.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a single satellite channel for most of our needs.

00:39:17.171 --> 00:39:19.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But occasionally, we use a second channel

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:23.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we broadcast live events, like conventions

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:25.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or branch visits.

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:28.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the representative
from world headquarters gives his talk

00:39:28.315 --> 00:39:30.317 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from Bethel, it is transmitted to us

00:39:30.317 --> 00:39:31.752 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
live through the satellite.

00:39:31.752 --> 00:39:33.254 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This makes us feel like we

00:39:33.254 --> 00:39:34.855 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
are right there at Bethel.

00:39:34.855 --> 00:39:36.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are very happy.

00:39:36.957 --> 00:39:38.292 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The most recent live event

00:39:38.292 --> 00:39:40.928 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we broadcasted originated in France.

00:39:40.928 --> 00:39:45.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the release of the revised edition
of the New World Translation,

00:39:45.433 --> 00:39:47.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so this was very exciting.

00:39:47.468 --> 00:39:49.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And brothers and sisters
that attended conventions

00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:52.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in ten different branch territories in Africa

00:39:52.706 --> 00:39:55.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were able to tie in
to this broadcast that originated in France,

00:39:55.843 --> 00:39:57.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
using the satellite.

00:39:59.346 --> 00:40:01.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our branch territory,

00:40:01.348 --> 00:40:04.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are arranging
for all new or remodeled Kingdom Halls

00:40:04.385 --> 00:40:08.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have satellite equipment
as part of the standard audio/video package.

00:40:10.758 --> 00:40:12.193 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We were very happy

00:40:12.193 --> 00:40:13.994 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when we received the satellite dish

00:40:13.994 --> 00:40:15.729 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because we could see that now

00:40:15.729 --> 00:40:18.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are really close 
to the brothers on the Governing Body.

00:40:20.067 --> 00:40:22.336 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The satellite channel is excellent!

00:40:22.336 --> 00:40:24.738 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This provision touches our hearts.

00:40:24.738 --> 00:40:28.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The deaf all over the country
benefited from the special talk

00:40:28.542 --> 00:40:31.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it was interpreted
into Malawian Sign Language,

00:40:31.378 --> 00:40:34.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showing that Jehovah truly loves deaf people.

00:40:34.381 --> 00:40:37.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this helps us
to strengthen our relationship with Jehovah.

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:53.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hope and pray
that access to the JW satellite feed

00:40:53.234 --> 00:40:57.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
becomes available
to as many of our brothers and sisters

00:40:57.371 --> 00:41:01.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as possible in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:41:21.428 --> 00:41:23.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we could see,

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:27.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the organization prioritizes
the needs of Jehovah’s people.

00:41:27.535 --> 00:41:31.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as it does, it finds a modest solution

00:41:31.205 --> 00:41:35.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can best serve the needs
of as many people as possible.

00:41:35.376 --> 00:41:38.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we discussed earlier in the program,

00:41:38.179 --> 00:41:42.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
modesty is equally important on an individual level.

00:41:42.049 --> 00:41:45.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there are times when we have to ask ourselves

00:41:45.286 --> 00:41:47.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we’re confusing modesty

00:41:47.488 --> 00:41:50.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with our own imperfect view of ourselves.

00:41:51.125 --> 00:41:53.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meet Juan Cayul from Chile.

00:41:53.694 --> 00:41:55.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s of the Mapuche tribe

00:41:55.796 --> 00:41:59.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a tribe which has faced  
discrimination over the years.

00:41:59.333 --> 00:42:01.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of the discrimination,

00:42:01.669 --> 00:42:04.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some may be reluctant to use their language,

00:42:04.772 --> 00:42:07.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mapudungún, in public.

00:42:07.241 --> 00:42:09.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This became a challenge for Juan,

00:42:09.743 --> 00:42:13.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since he wanted to give
his best in the ministry for Jehovah.

00:42:14.582 --> 00:42:17.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mapudungún means ‘the speech of my land.’

00:42:17.952 --> 00:42:21.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a beautiful and expressive language,

00:42:21.155 --> 00:42:23.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s the language of my heart.

00:42:23.958 --> 00:42:27.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 12 years old, I went to live

00:42:27.728 --> 00:42:29.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with my grandfather and my uncle’s family

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:31.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I could study at a nearby school.

00:42:31.999 --> 00:42:34.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My cousins spoke Mapudungún a lot,

00:42:34.468 --> 00:42:36.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which made me really happy.

00:42:40.374 --> 00:42:43.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I saw that some of my classmates
didn’t understand their schoolwork,

00:42:43.677 --> 00:42:47.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially in math class,
I would try to help them out.

00:42:48.849 --> 00:42:50.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s when I started to think about becoming

00:42:50.584 --> 00:42:53.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a math teacher so that I could really help others.

00:42:56.457 --> 00:42:58.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the head teacher told me
that because I was speaking

00:42:58.959 --> 00:43:01.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mapudungún and because
I was helping my classmates,

00:43:02.129 --> 00:43:04.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she was going to lower my grades.

00:43:05.899 --> 00:43:08.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When my father saw my grades, he was furious.

00:43:08.736 --> 00:43:11.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He accused me of being lazy and not studying.

00:43:13.073 --> 00:43:17.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He withdrew me from school,
and I went back home to Tromén.

00:43:18.212 --> 00:43:20.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My dream of becoming a teacher

00:43:20.247 --> 00:43:22.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was shattered.

00:43:24.251 --> 00:43:28.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because my dad had suffered so much
as a victim of discrimination,

00:43:28.355 --> 00:43:30.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he told us that we
were not to speak Mapudungún.

00:43:35.429 --> 00:43:37.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I think about everything that happened,

00:43:40.901 --> 00:43:42.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it makes me very sad.

00:43:46.073 --> 00:43:49.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Years later, I met Sylvia

00:43:49.243 --> 00:43:50.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was Mapuche like me.

00:43:50.844 --> 00:43:53.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She proved to be a sensitive and loving person.

00:43:53.447 --> 00:43:55.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We spoke Mapudungún together,

00:43:55.115 --> 00:43:57.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that helped to relieve the bitterness

00:43:57.418 --> 00:43:59.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt in my heart.

00:44:01.255 --> 00:44:03.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some time later, I learned about someone else

00:44:03.957 --> 00:44:06.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who made me feel loved and valued—Jehovah.

00:44:06.493 --> 00:44:09.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That changed my life.

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:11.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All my pain disappeared

00:44:11.799 --> 00:44:14.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
once I got to know Jehovah.

00:44:14.635 --> 00:44:17.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife and I studied the Bible

00:44:17.338 --> 00:44:19.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Witnesses in Spanish.

00:44:19.606 --> 00:44:22.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so when I started to preach and teach,

00:44:22.676 --> 00:44:25.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I used Spanish too.

00:44:25.245 --> 00:44:29.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, I was out in service,
and as we approached a house

00:44:29.983 --> 00:44:32.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an elderly Mapuche woman came to the door.

00:44:32.553 --> 00:44:34.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was scared.

00:44:35.422 --> 00:44:37.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So straight away I greeted her in Mapudungún.

00:44:38.926 --> 00:44:42.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She invited us inside and spoke with us.

00:44:45.466 --> 00:44:47.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the first time

00:44:47.468 --> 00:44:50.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had spoken about Jehovah in my mother tongue.

00:44:54.808 --> 00:44:57.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On our way back, I was deep in thought,

00:44:57.444 --> 00:45:00.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
praying to Jehovah
about how to help the Mapuche people.

00:45:02.282 --> 00:45:04.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many years passed

00:45:04.284 --> 00:45:06.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before I saw an answer to my prayers.

00:45:08.722 --> 00:45:11.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then one day after the meeting, I received

00:45:11.392 --> 00:45:13.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an invitation to be a speaker at the first assembly

00:45:13.694 --> 00:45:16.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to include talks in Mapudungún.

00:45:18.665 --> 00:45:20.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I didn’t want to accept the assignment.

00:45:20.901 --> 00:45:24.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt worthless because
of all the discrimination I had endured.

00:45:25.472 --> 00:45:27.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So

00:45:27.474 --> 00:45:31.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed again and again to Jehovah

00:45:32.112 --> 00:45:34.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and began to meditate a lot.

00:45:35.916 --> 00:45:39.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was now giving me
an answer to my prayers.

00:45:41.054 --> 00:45:43.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He sees our true value.

00:46:08.449 --> 00:46:10.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so happy, so very happy.

00:46:10.517 --> 00:46:12.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I understood that Jehovah loved me

00:46:12.519 --> 00:46:15.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cared for me
and that he would continue to help me.

00:46:16.623 --> 00:46:19.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In just a few years, not one,

00:46:19.159 --> 00:46:22.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but several Mapudungún congregations were formed.

00:46:22.095 --> 00:46:26.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now my wife and I,
as well as our two children,

00:46:26.266 --> 00:46:28.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
serve in Mapudungún-language congregations.

00:46:30.904 --> 00:46:33.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve been assisting with Mapudungún translation

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:35.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for more than seven years now.

00:46:37.044 --> 00:46:40.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I tell the brothers and sisters
who work with me at the translation office

00:46:40.714 --> 00:46:43.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about my childhood dream of becoming a teacher,

00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:46.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they tell me, “You’re our teacher now.”

00:46:48.555 --> 00:46:51.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to say to my brothers
and sisters around the world:

00:46:51.959 --> 00:46:53.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Don’t put yourselves down.

00:46:53.961 --> 00:46:56.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are precious; you are precious to Jehovah.

00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:59.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will always help you.”

00:47:23.257 --> 00:47:28.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It took courage for Juan
to overcome his fear of discrimination.

00:47:28.262 --> 00:47:30.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our lives as Christians,

00:47:30.764 --> 00:47:35.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can imitate Juan’s example
of courage in many different ways.

00:47:35.369 --> 00:47:40.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we do,
let’s remember the words of Joshua 1:9:

00:47:40.374 --> 00:47:42.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Have I not commanded you?

00:47:42.776 --> 00:47:45.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be courageous and strong.

00:47:45.312 --> 00:47:48.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be struck with terror or fear,

00:47:48.215 --> 00:47:51.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Jehovah your God
is with you wherever you go.”

00:47:52.986 --> 00:47:54.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With that scripture in mind,

00:47:54.988 --> 00:47:58.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please enjoy the music video
for this month entitled

00:47:58.859 --> 00:48:01.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be Courageous and Strong.

00:48:03.864 --> 00:48:10.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s dark outside.
To start the day,

00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:16.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She humbly starts to pray
For her kids at school

00:48:16.543 --> 00:48:24.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the brotherhood:
“Father, help us be faithful.”

00:48:24.117 --> 00:48:33.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When things make it hard to cope,
She never thinks of losing hope,

00:48:33.594 --> 00:48:42.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never stops being kind.
And that song—it’s always on her mind:

00:48:42.569 --> 00:48:52.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I will make you strong.
Do not be afraid.

00:48:52.779 --> 00:49:02.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will be with you.
I will be your aid.’

00:49:02.289 --> 00:49:11.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be courageous and strong.
It’s her favorite song.

00:49:11.999 --> 00:49:23.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And “he will make you firm,
And he will make you strong.”

00:49:23.176 --> 00:49:28.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Time to get on her feet—
Try to make ends meet—

00:49:28.448 --> 00:49:35.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never sure what to expect.
Her true friends out there

00:49:35.555 --> 00:49:42.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really show her they care,
So she never needs to fret.

00:50:21.668 --> 00:50:27.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’ll soar on wings
To rise up high,

00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:33.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like eagles in the sky.
All the roles she plays—

00:50:33.213 --> 00:50:40.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So little time each day—
And in her heart, she starts to pray.

00:50:40.287 --> 00:50:49.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aching feet and tired hands—
She tries the very best she can.

00:50:49.896 --> 00:50:58.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there’s strength she can find
In that song that’s always on her mind:

00:50:58.238 --> 00:51:08.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I will make you strong.
Do not be afraid.

00:51:08.482 --> 00:51:17.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will be with you.
I will be your aid.’

00:51:17.657 --> 00:51:27.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be courageous and strong.
It’s her favorite song.

00:51:27.134 --> 00:51:38.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And “he will make you firm,
And he will make you strong.”

00:51:38.311 --> 00:51:47.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And “he will make you firm,
And he will make you strong.”

00:51:53.827 --> 00:51:56.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve seen many examples of modesty

00:51:56.396 --> 00:51:58.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the program this month.

00:51:58.932 --> 00:52:01.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, the McConnell sisters helped us appreciate

00:52:01.768 --> 00:52:03.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that true family happiness

00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:07.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is only possible when we
follow Jehovah’s principles.

00:52:07.741 --> 00:52:10.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Modest parents know their limitations

00:52:10.677 --> 00:52:13.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and will rely on Jehovah’s guidance.

00:52:14.381 --> 00:52:18.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the talk,
we saw how a young brother’s modesty

00:52:18.151 --> 00:52:21.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
protected him from sinning against Jehovah.

00:52:22.622 --> 00:52:26.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, we saw examples
of organizational achievements,

00:52:26.326 --> 00:52:29.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of which require modesty.

00:52:29.196 --> 00:52:33.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw this not only
in the Faith in Action Museum at Warwick

00:52:33.533 --> 00:52:35.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also with the satellite provision

00:52:35.902 --> 00:52:38.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for JW Broadcasting®

00:52:38.004 --> 00:52:40.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:52:41.141 --> 00:52:43.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we need to be careful not to confuse

00:52:43.643 --> 00:52:47.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our imperfect view of ourselves with modesty.

00:52:47.614 --> 00:52:51.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, we should do all we can
to support Jehovah’s work.

00:52:51.818 --> 00:52:55.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we do,
Jehovah will support us,

00:52:55.455 --> 00:52:58.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as this month’s music video highlighted.

00:52:58.925 --> 00:53:02.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And later this month,
you’ll find an exciting report

00:53:02.495 --> 00:53:04.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Video on Demand.

00:53:04.664 --> 00:53:08.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s about the work of the Publishing Committee
of the Governing Body.

00:53:08.468 --> 00:53:11.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So tune in again for that.

00:53:11.271 --> 00:53:13.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To conclude,

00:53:13.273 --> 00:53:17.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s visit our brothers
and sisters in Tasmania, Australia.

00:53:19.246 --> 00:53:23.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tasmania is Australia’s smallest state

00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:27.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and is an island located about 240 kilometers,

00:53:27.821 --> 00:53:31.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or 150 miles, south of the mainland.

00:53:31.324 --> 00:53:33.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite its small land mass,

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:36.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s known for its very diverse landscape

00:53:36.796 --> 00:53:39.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
featuring beautiful yet rugged mountain,

00:53:39.933 --> 00:53:42.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lake, and coastal landscapes.

00:53:44.004 --> 00:53:47.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The central plateau
is a prominent feature of Tasmania,

00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:50.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thanks to its more than 4,000 lakes

00:53:50.443 --> 00:53:52.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of glacial origin.

00:53:52.712 --> 00:53:56.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This island is home to close to 1,800 publishers

00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:58.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 22 congregations.

00:53:59.753 --> 00:54:02.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is the Huonville Congregation.

00:54:03.490 --> 00:54:07.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They care for Australia’s southernmost territory.
