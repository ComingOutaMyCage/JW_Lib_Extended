Hello, everyone.

00:00:03.286 --> 00:00:07.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re so happy to have you with us
for this month’s broadcast.

00:00:07.223 --> 00:00:10.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you can see,
I have a friend with me as cohost.

00:00:10.593 --> 00:00:12.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are friends, aren’t we?

00:00:12.862 --> 00:00:14.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we are, David.

00:00:14.197 --> 00:00:15.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, that’s so good to hear.

00:00:15.632 --> 00:00:17.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Herman van Selm.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s a helper to the Writing Committee,

00:00:19.803 --> 00:00:22.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we work together
every day in the Writing Department.

00:00:22.706 --> 00:00:24.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Herman has quite a background.

00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:26.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was born in the Netherlands

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and spent a number of years
as a missionary in South America.

00:00:30.013 --> 00:00:31.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was that like, Herman?

00:00:31.848 --> 00:00:33.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, David, for asking.

00:00:33.917 --> 00:00:36.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife, Kay, and I
served in three different lands.

00:00:36.986 --> 00:00:39.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, to sum up that part of our life,

00:00:39.222 --> 00:00:42.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
three words come to mind:
challenging,

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:44.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
amazing, rewarding.

00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:46.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In one challenging assignment,

00:00:46.863 --> 00:00:48.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we lived in a remote area in the rain forest

00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:51.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where there were no other Witnesses.

00:00:51.334 --> 00:00:53.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We wondered: ‘Will we be able

00:00:53.436 --> 00:00:55.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘to find people who want to serve Jehovah?

00:00:55.605 --> 00:00:57.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where do we start?’

00:00:57.607 --> 00:01:01.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We got on our bikes
and visited all the villagers.

00:01:01.177 --> 00:01:04.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In time, we conducted about 25 Bible studies.

00:01:04.614 --> 00:01:05.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:01:05.615 --> 00:01:08.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now,
despite fierce opposition from neighbors,

00:01:08.184 --> 00:01:10.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible students made amazing progress.

00:01:10.687 --> 00:01:13.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, one woman, with her children,

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
worked hard to build this beautiful hut,

00:01:16.292 --> 00:01:19.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it brought us to tears when she told us:

00:01:19.262 --> 00:01:22.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This hut, we made it for our meetings.

00:01:22.065 --> 00:01:23.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is for Jehovah.”

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amazing!

00:01:25.468 --> 00:01:27.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, a group of courageous Bible students

00:01:27.804 --> 00:01:29.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showed us the letters they had written

00:01:29.806 --> 00:01:31.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to resign as members of their church.

00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:34.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that week, the church’s pastor

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:36.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in that tiny village received

00:01:36.946 --> 00:01:38.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a lot of mail!

00:01:38.448 --> 00:01:40.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I guess, mail he didn’t want to receive.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was no fan mail.

00:01:42.452 --> 00:01:46.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was such
a rewarding experience for Kay and me

00:01:46.122 --> 00:01:48.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see close up
how Jehovah made that little group

00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
grow into a congregation.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, it strengthens the faith

00:01:52.962 --> 00:01:54.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of all of us, wherever we may live,

00:01:54.964 --> 00:01:57.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see how Jehovah cares for people

00:01:57.267 --> 00:02:00.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are often viewed
as insignificant by the world

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but who are precious in God’s eyes.

00:02:03.406 --> 00:02:05.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Great pictures—I love it!

00:02:05.842 --> 00:02:09.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what can the friends
look forward to this month?

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, David, this month

00:02:11.681 --> 00:02:15.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll meet Andrey Nesmachniy,
a retired professional

00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:17.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
soccer player whose story

00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:20.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may help us to analyze
our own priorities in life.

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, we’ll see how Thomas learns to balance

00:02:24.994 --> 00:02:28.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his secular work with his spiritual needs.

00:02:28.264 --> 00:02:32.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ll enjoy an upbeat music video

00:02:32.035 --> 00:02:34.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that reminds us all of the wonderful “family”

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:37.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we enjoy in Jehovah’s organization.

00:02:37.273 --> 00:02:39.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sounds exciting, let’s get started!

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:43.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the September 2019 program

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of JW Broadcasting.

00:03:05.635 --> 00:03:09.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This month,  I’m going to talk
about two different subjects.

00:03:09.572 --> 00:03:12.876 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
First, I’d like to talk about the translation

00:03:12.876 --> 00:03:14.577 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of our publications,

00:03:14.577 --> 00:03:16.112 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and there’s a particular aspect

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:18.448 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of translation I’d like to comment on.

00:03:19.415 --> 00:03:22.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I know
that quite a number of you have moved

00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:24.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a country
where your mother tongue isn’t spoken

00:03:24.754 --> 00:03:28.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—either to find work
or to serve where the need is greater.

00:03:28.558 --> 00:03:30.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And others are serving right at home

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in foreign-language congregations.

00:03:35.431 --> 00:03:38.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, you may have compared
an article in your mother tongue

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:41.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the same article in your second language

00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:44.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and found differences in the translation,

00:03:44.173 --> 00:03:47.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you might wonder why that is.

00:03:47.043 --> 00:03:49.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’d never conclude
that the translators

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:52.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had been unfaithful or careless

00:03:52.115 --> 00:03:54.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or that they were running
ahead of the organization.

00:03:54.951 --> 00:03:56.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:58.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We trust
our hardworking brothers and sisters.

00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:02.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we know there must be
good reasons for the differences,

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the purpose of this brief discussion

00:04:05.295 --> 00:04:08.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to suggest what some
of those reasons might be.

00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:13.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, a word about one
of the principles our translators follow.

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:18.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re expected not only to render
the thought in the English text accurately

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:21.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also to keep in mind
the way people speak.

00:04:21.978 --> 00:04:25.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So accuracy, clarity,

00:04:25.081 --> 00:04:27.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and naturalness are needed

00:04:27.216 --> 00:04:30.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while maintaining the dignity of our message.

00:04:30.987 --> 00:04:34.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what’s involved
in preparing a translation

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s both accurate and natural?

00:04:37.994 --> 00:04:41.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not as if the translators
are like the Jewish scribes

00:04:41.331 --> 00:04:44.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who made copies of the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:46.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To make sure that the copies they made

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were accurate in every detail,

00:04:48.271 --> 00:04:51.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would count not only every word

00:04:51.074 --> 00:04:54.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also every letter
they copied from the source text.

00:04:55.478 --> 00:04:57.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Translation is not like that.

00:04:57.714 --> 00:05:01.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not as if there must be
seven words in the target language

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if there are seven words in English.

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:06.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every word in English may not be translated,

00:05:06.656 --> 00:05:09.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the complete thought
of the English has to be there.

00:05:10.927 --> 00:05:15.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
English makes effective use of repetition.

00:05:15.031 --> 00:05:17.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we mean by that?

00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:22.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you can write one sentence in English
and then repeat the same thought

00:05:22.338 --> 00:05:24.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in slightly different words
in the next sentence,

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:25.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it sounds fine.

00:05:25.942 --> 00:05:27.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in some languages,

00:05:27.944 --> 00:05:30.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to repeat a thought
would be viewed as poor writing,

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that wouldn’t reflect well
on our publications.

00:05:34.017 --> 00:05:36.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in such cases,

00:05:36.552 --> 00:05:38.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the translators are allowed to combine

00:05:38.821 --> 00:05:41.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
two sentences into just one sentence

00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:45.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as long as the thought
is completely conveyed.

00:05:45.061 --> 00:05:49.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or they might make two sentences
out of one long English sentence

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:52.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if that’s more natural in the language.

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:56.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you can’t always compare
the length of an English paragraph

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:59.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the length of the paragraph

00:05:59.075 --> 00:06:01.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the target language and say,

00:06:01.077 --> 00:06:04.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Hey, this paragraph
is shorter than that paragraph.”

00:06:05.248 --> 00:06:09.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes we hear brothers
who have learned a second language say:

00:06:09.152 --> 00:06:13.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I don’t see why the translators
didn’t follow the English word for word.

00:06:13.256 --> 00:06:17.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all,
you can say that in the language.”

00:06:17.393 --> 00:06:19.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you may have the words.

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:22.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may be possible to “say” that,

00:06:22.732 --> 00:06:27.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but would a literal translation
sound strange to native speakers?

00:06:27.737 --> 00:06:31.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter how well a foreigner
has learned a language,

00:06:31.007 --> 00:06:34.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
native speakers who speak
the language well

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are usually the best judge
 of what is natural.

00:06:38.381 --> 00:06:42.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Modesty will help foreign speakers
to recognize that.

00:06:43.986 --> 00:06:47.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s another thing
that foreign speakers need to be aware of.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they’re vocal
in their criticism of a certain translation,

00:06:52.128 --> 00:06:55.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how would that affect
the confidence of native speakers

00:06:55.098 --> 00:06:58.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have to rely on the translation
for their spiritual food?

00:06:59.936 --> 00:07:02.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, nobody is perfect,

00:07:02.605 --> 00:07:06.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as long as translation
is done by imperfect people,

00:07:06.109 --> 00:07:08.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it won’t be perfect.

00:07:08.111 --> 00:07:10.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But rest assured that our translators

00:07:10.613 --> 00:07:13.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take their work very seriously.

00:07:14.884 --> 00:07:17.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The subject of translation is complex.

00:07:17.453 --> 00:07:19.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m surely no expert.

00:07:19.455 --> 00:07:23.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s hear from some brothers
who have worked in the field for many years

00:07:23.292 --> 00:07:25.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see what we can learn.

00:07:25.328 --> 00:07:28.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meet Nick Ahladis,

00:07:28.297 --> 00:07:30.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nick Exarcheas,

00:07:30.733 --> 00:07:32.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Saki Marais.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we have just heard,

00:07:36.005 --> 00:07:39.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the goal of translators is to convey ideas

00:07:39.242 --> 00:07:43.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
accurately, naturally, and clearly.

00:07:43.346 --> 00:07:46.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This isn’t an easy thing to do.

00:07:46.082 --> 00:07:49.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s discuss
a few of the challenges of translation.

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:52.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will focus on three areas

00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:56.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see why translators
make the choices they do:

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bible expressions,

00:07:59.195 --> 00:08:00.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
illustrations,

00:08:00.863 --> 00:08:03.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and vocabulary.

00:08:03.232 --> 00:08:06.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our first point is Bible expressions.

00:08:07.403 --> 00:08:09.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nick, could you please tell us

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:13.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why translating some expressions in the Bible

00:08:13.809 --> 00:08:15.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be very challenging?

00:08:15.945 --> 00:08:18.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, before our brothers and sisters

00:08:18.247 --> 00:08:21.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
receive the New World Translation
in their language,

00:08:21.717 --> 00:08:25.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they have to use Bibles
produced by Christendom.

00:08:25.221 --> 00:08:29.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Often, these Bibles
contain false religious ideas

00:08:29.425 --> 00:08:32.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and terms that reflect those ideas.

00:08:32.628 --> 00:08:35.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we produce the New World Translation,

00:08:35.431 --> 00:08:37.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
great care has to be taken

00:08:37.433 --> 00:08:41.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to allow such terms
to distort our translation.

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:45.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you give us an example of an expression

00:08:45.508 --> 00:08:48.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was translated the wrong way

00:08:48.744 --> 00:08:51.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Bibles produced by Christendom?

00:08:51.013 --> 00:08:55.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one example is the term “holy spirit.”

00:08:55.084 --> 00:08:58.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In many Bibles produced by Christendom,

00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:03.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the term gives the idea
of a spirit creature in heaven,

00:09:03.926 --> 00:09:08.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even a “holy ghost,”
sometimes even a “holy demon.”

00:09:08.097 --> 00:09:11.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That must be very confusing to the readers.

00:09:11.767 --> 00:09:15.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what can the translators do about that?

00:09:15.004 --> 00:09:17.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In many languages,
our translators have found

00:09:17.073 --> 00:09:19.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the closest way
to translate “holy spirit”

00:09:19.575 --> 00:09:23.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to say “holy power” or “holy force.”

00:09:23.145 --> 00:09:25.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This may sound very different,

00:09:25.147 --> 00:09:27.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it conveys the same idea.

00:09:27.917 --> 00:09:29.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even the English New World Translation

00:09:29.919 --> 00:09:31.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
describes the term “holy spirit”

00:09:31.921 --> 00:09:35.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “God’s active force” at Genesis 1:2,

00:09:35.558 --> 00:09:38.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while other English translations
say “God’s holy spirit.”

00:09:38.861 --> 00:09:39.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good.

00:09:39.729 --> 00:09:42.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now the brothers
can use an expression

00:09:42.732 --> 00:09:47.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is understood
by the field and the audience.

00:09:47.236 --> 00:09:51.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it must be a wonderful thing
to have the New World Translation.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it’s a wonderful thing.

00:09:53.209 --> 00:09:57.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But still, the brothers
have to get used to the new terms.

00:09:57.413 --> 00:09:59.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember that they’ve been using

00:09:59.415 --> 00:10:03.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the original terms
in their local Bibles for years

00:10:03.352 --> 00:10:05.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach people the truth.

00:10:05.354 --> 00:10:08.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as they get used to the new terminology

00:10:08.357 --> 00:10:12.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their personal study,
at meetings, and in the ministry,

00:10:12.094 --> 00:10:15.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they begin to see
the benefits of the new terms,

00:10:15.364 --> 00:10:18.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and afterward they really embrace
the New World Translation.

00:10:18.768 --> 00:10:20.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:10:20.136 --> 00:10:22.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let us go to the second challenge,

00:10:22.571 --> 00:10:24.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
illustrations.

00:10:24.573 --> 00:10:26.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are illustrations

00:10:26.575 --> 00:10:28.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
particularly difficult to translate?

00:10:29.712 --> 00:10:33.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An illustration that works in one culture
might not work in another.

00:10:33.316 --> 00:10:37.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Illustrations are only effective
if the reader can relate to them.

00:10:37.219 --> 00:10:39.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s why Jesus used illustrations

00:10:39.288 --> 00:10:42.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
based on everyday things
that his audience was familiar with,

00:10:42.124 --> 00:10:45.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as farming, building, fishing.

00:10:45.528 --> 00:10:47.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And today, our publications

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:49.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also use illustrations 
that people can relate to.

00:10:49.865 --> 00:10:52.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember an article
that discussed the need

00:10:52.301 --> 00:10:55.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for us to be patient in difficult situations.

00:10:55.838 --> 00:10:59.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it used the illustration 
of a driver who is stuck in traffic.

00:10:59.375 --> 00:11:02.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, one translation team
wrote to the Translator Help Desk,

00:11:02.278 --> 00:11:04.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they explained that most of their readers

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were not familiar with traffic jams.

00:11:06.482 --> 00:11:08.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For someone who lives in a big city,

00:11:08.484 --> 00:11:10.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that sounds unbelievable, but it’s true.

00:11:10.786 --> 00:11:13.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the team wanted to use
a different illustration.

00:11:13.823 --> 00:11:17.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are familiar with the idea
of people standing in long lines,

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:21.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
waiting for their maize, or corn,
to be ground at the milling machine.

00:11:21.597 --> 00:11:23.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this illustration was approved

00:11:23.599 --> 00:11:26.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it would help
their readers to get the point:

00:11:26.235 --> 00:11:28.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They need to be patient.

00:11:28.237 --> 00:11:31.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, these are
completely different illustrations,

00:11:31.307 --> 00:11:33.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the point
—or the message—

00:11:33.309 --> 00:11:36.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the same, for example,
then, about being patient.

00:11:36.512 --> 00:11:40.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when we read in our language edition

00:11:40.449 --> 00:11:42.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of The Watchtower or other publication

00:11:42.585 --> 00:11:46.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a different illustration
than the one we read in English,

00:11:46.255 --> 00:11:49.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can be confident
that the translators received approval

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:53.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make this adjustment
so that the right message is conveyed.

00:11:53.529 --> 00:11:56.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that was very helpful.
Thank you.

00:11:56.165 --> 00:11:58.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let us go to our third challenge

00:11:58.367 --> 00:12:00.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that of vocabulary,

00:12:00.369 --> 00:12:03.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is,
the words that are used in a language.

00:12:04.874 --> 00:12:07.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we might assume
that for every important word

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:09.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our language

00:12:09.812 --> 00:12:11.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there will be an exact equivalent

00:12:11.814 --> 00:12:13.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in another language.

00:12:14.283 --> 00:12:17.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, translation
is much more complicated than that.

00:12:17.353 --> 00:12:19.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take, for example, the word “peace.”

00:12:19.922 --> 00:12:21.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some years back,

00:12:21.924 --> 00:12:25.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had a convention about godly peace.

00:12:25.494 --> 00:12:28.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one might think,
‘Well, that’s an easy word to translate.’

00:12:28.898 --> 00:12:32.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that word was used about 350 times

00:12:32.601 --> 00:12:34.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in talks on the convention

00:12:34.904 --> 00:12:38.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—sometimes referring to peace
between God and man,

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:42.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometimes referring to peace
in family or with our neighbors,

00:12:42.511 --> 00:12:45.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other times
referring to peace of mind.

00:12:45.414 --> 00:12:48.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in some languages,
there’s simply no way

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:52.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to use just one word
to convey all those aspects of peace

00:12:52.154 --> 00:12:56.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they have one word
for the kind of peace that God gives,

00:12:56.525 --> 00:13:01.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a different word for when there’s no war
in a country (that kind of peace),

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a different word to indicate that people

00:13:03.666 --> 00:13:05.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are getting along with one another.

00:13:05.835 --> 00:13:09.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So those translators
need to understand the point

00:13:09.472 --> 00:13:12.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of each usage in the context

00:13:12.241 --> 00:13:15.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then convey
the right translation accordingly.

00:13:16.178 --> 00:13:19.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now it opens our minds
to how wonderfully Jehovah made us,

00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:22.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the capacity to think and feel

00:13:22.117 --> 00:13:24.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have many concepts and ideas

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:29.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to have the ability
to express them in our language

00:13:29.525 --> 00:13:31.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in words—
to use words for that.

00:13:31.827 --> 00:13:34.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we express them
in so many different ways.

00:13:34.897 --> 00:13:36.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it’s so true.

00:13:36.465 --> 00:13:39.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every language has its own vocabulary
and way of expressing things.

00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:42.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What I find very interesting
is how other languages

00:13:42.938 --> 00:13:46.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
render standard expressions
that we use as Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:13:46.542 --> 00:13:49.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
“field service,” “circuit overseer,”

00:13:49.745 --> 00:13:52.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Kingdom Hall,” “special pioneer”

00:13:52.281 --> 00:13:54.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—those expressions
were first used in English,

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:57.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then translators
had to come up with equivalents

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their languages
so that it would make sense.

00:13:59.955 --> 00:14:02.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that wouldn’t be difficult
—would it?—

00:14:02.124 --> 00:14:04.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because for the word “kingdom”

00:14:04.126 --> 00:14:06.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
surely we have
another word in another language,

00:14:06.862 --> 00:14:10.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for the word “hall”
we have an equivalent word.

00:14:10.132 --> 00:14:12.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all you have to do
is put the two words together

00:14:12.134 --> 00:14:14.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to translate “Kingdom Hall.”

00:14:14.236 --> 00:14:16.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may have the words,

00:14:16.238 --> 00:14:18.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but a literal translation of “Kingdom Hall”

00:14:18.574 --> 00:14:20.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could mean something totally different.

00:14:20.709 --> 00:14:23.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, some countries still have a king.

00:14:23.012 --> 00:14:26.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In those places,
this “Kingdom Hall” could mean

00:14:26.415 --> 00:14:29.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“government office,” or it could mean

00:14:29.018 --> 00:14:32.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“hall belonging to the kingdom
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”

00:14:32.154 --> 00:14:34.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that would be totally misleading.

00:14:34.156 --> 00:14:37.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s why the Governing Body
has given approval to say

00:14:37.826 --> 00:14:40.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the “Meeting Place of Jehovah’s Witnesses”

00:14:40.596 --> 00:14:43.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the “Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”

00:14:43.198 --> 00:14:46.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though the expressions
sound a little bit different,

00:14:46.735 --> 00:14:49.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the basic intent is the same,
and people get the right idea.

00:14:50.873 --> 00:14:55.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it is obvious
that the challenges of translation are huge.

00:14:55.878 --> 00:14:57.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now the question is,

00:14:57.179 --> 00:15:00.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can a newly formed translation team

00:15:00.449 --> 00:15:03.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or one in a very remote location

00:15:03.752 --> 00:15:06.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have the confidence
and have the assurance

00:15:06.922 --> 00:15:10.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they produce
the highest standard possible?

00:15:10.893 --> 00:15:15.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, all translation teams,
regardless of size or location,

00:15:15.297 --> 00:15:17.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
benefit from regular communication

00:15:17.366 --> 00:15:19.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Writing Committee
of the Governing Body.

00:15:19.935 --> 00:15:22.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we understand that the Governing Body

00:15:22.571 --> 00:15:24.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
directs matters from headquarters,

00:15:24.773 --> 00:15:28.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but do they really know
what the translators are doing?

00:15:28.944 --> 00:15:31.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well,
the Writing Committee trusts the translators,

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but at the same time,
they don’t try to micromanage their work.

00:15:35.918 --> 00:15:39.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What they have done
is set in place training programs

00:15:39.722 --> 00:15:43.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach translators
basic translation principles

00:15:43.559 --> 00:15:47.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help them to understand
how to apply those principles

00:15:47.329 --> 00:15:49.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when translating the publications.

00:15:49.531 --> 00:15:52.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this ensures that the same message

00:15:52.334 --> 00:15:55.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is being conveyed regardless of language.

00:15:55.571 --> 00:15:59.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when they’re not sure that their solution

00:15:59.608 --> 00:16:02.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is exactly right on target,

00:16:02.411 --> 00:16:04.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they can write to the Writing Committee

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:08.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ask for direction
to inquire whether this solution

00:16:08.751 --> 00:16:10.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
conveys the right idea in the context.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, the Writing Committee answers

00:16:13.422 --> 00:16:16.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hundreds of translation questions every week

00:16:16.258 --> 00:16:18.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as part of the ongoing training of the teams.

00:16:18.794 --> 00:16:21.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of the translators
have access to these answers

00:16:21.196 --> 00:16:23.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they can learn from one another

00:16:23.232 --> 00:16:26.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to solve problems
that are delicate and difficult.

00:16:26.535 --> 00:16:29.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This effective communication system

00:16:29.338 --> 00:16:33.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really helps to unify
the thinking of all the translators

00:16:33.008 --> 00:16:35.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to make sure
that they all produce the same message.

00:16:35.744 --> 00:16:39.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that unifies
the thinking of the worldwide field.

00:16:39.548 --> 00:16:43.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, thank you very much
for explaining those factors

00:16:43.719 --> 00:16:45.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
affecting translation,

00:16:45.754 --> 00:16:47.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it is impressive

00:16:47.756 --> 00:16:50.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has an arrangement in place

00:16:50.426 --> 00:16:54.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that reverses the effect of Babel.

00:16:55.164 --> 00:17:00.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it is also so wonderful
that by means of his holy spirit,

00:17:00.169 --> 00:17:04.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah unifies his people around the earth

00:17:04.039 --> 00:17:06.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regardless of what language they use.

00:17:07.509 --> 00:17:09.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks, brothers.

00:17:09.778 --> 00:17:11.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve given us an even deeper appreciation

00:17:11.947 --> 00:17:15.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all of the work involved
in making a quality translation.

00:17:15.617 --> 00:17:17.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned a lot.

00:17:17.052 --> 00:17:19.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure our audience did too.

00:17:21.023 --> 00:17:23.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the following video

00:17:23.192 --> 00:17:26.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
relates an experience 
that is very dear to my heart.

00:17:27.496 --> 00:17:30.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, in the 1970’s,

00:17:30.099 --> 00:17:34.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my wife and I were in the circuit work
in Montreal, Canada.

00:17:34.069 --> 00:17:36.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, one Tuesday evening after the meeting,

00:17:36.605 --> 00:17:39.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was approached by a ministerial servant.

00:17:39.074 --> 00:17:41.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was very excited!

00:17:41.276 --> 00:17:45.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “David, I work with a man
who is the head of a small church.

00:17:45.581 --> 00:17:47.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has invited me to his home!”

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:50.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That’s nice,” I said.

00:17:51.587 --> 00:17:54.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “No, no, no, you don’t understand!

00:17:54.189 --> 00:17:58.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They never invite anyone to their home
unless they are members of the church.

00:17:58.193 --> 00:18:00.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think this is going to be big.”

00:18:01.296 --> 00:18:03.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well,” I said, “if he’s interested,

00:18:03.766 --> 00:18:05.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“invite him to come
to the meeting this weekend.

00:18:05.934 --> 00:18:07.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d love to meet him.”

00:18:07.936 --> 00:18:10.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that weekend
I was on the lookout for the man,

00:18:10.773 --> 00:18:12.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he didn’t show up.

00:18:12.775 --> 00:18:15.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But neither did the ministerial servant.

00:18:16.745 --> 00:18:19.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon after, on a Monday morning

00:18:19.314 --> 00:18:21.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—fairly early—

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I received a phone call
from Brother Laurier Saumur,

00:18:24.653 --> 00:18:28.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was well-known in Montreal 
and was a special pioneer at the time.

00:18:29.458 --> 00:18:32.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Laurier said: “We have a problem.

00:18:32.694 --> 00:18:35.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A thousand people want Bible studies,

00:18:35.931 --> 00:18:38.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many of them are going to be attending
our meetings this week.”

00:18:39.968 --> 00:18:42.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were the members of that church.

00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:47.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked Brother Saumur
to take the lead in organizing the studies.

00:18:47.309 --> 00:18:49.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s what happened:

00:18:49.478 --> 00:18:52.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The ministerial servant
had been to the man’s home

00:18:52.214 --> 00:18:54.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’d given a good witness.

00:18:54.249 --> 00:18:55.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then,

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:58.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brother met
with the other responsible men of the church.

00:18:58.854 --> 00:19:01.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were interested in what the Bible says,

00:19:01.356 --> 00:19:05.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they wanted other members of the church
to learn about the Bible too.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So about half the members of the church,

00:19:09.131 --> 00:19:11.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
around 1,000 people,

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
accepted the invitation
to have a Bible study.

00:19:16.004 --> 00:19:18.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what moved the leader of the church

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to invite the brother
to his home in the first place?

00:19:21.543 --> 00:19:26.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Watch the following video,
and I’ll answer that question at the end.

00:19:33.488 --> 00:19:37.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the mid-1970’s,
several brothers from the Montréal area

00:19:37.759 --> 00:19:41.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were approached to help
with a unique situation that was unfolding.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:44.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A special pioneer,
who was taking the lead at the time,

00:19:44.433 --> 00:19:48.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
said that about a thousand people
—all from the same church—

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:51.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wanted to study the Bible
with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:19:51.506 --> 00:19:54.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was all because of an informal witness.

00:19:56.778 --> 00:19:59.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The story began this way:

00:20:00.449 --> 00:20:02.451 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
A brother in the local congregation

00:20:02.451 --> 00:20:03.719 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
approached me one day

00:20:03.719 --> 00:20:04.953 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to tell me about an experience

00:20:04.953 --> 00:20:07.222 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
he had with one of his workmates.

00:20:07.222 --> 00:20:10.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This man was responsible
for a small local church,

00:20:10.459 --> 00:20:13.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the brother had been able
to give him an informal witness.

00:20:13.729 --> 00:20:15.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The man indicated

00:20:15.364 --> 00:20:17.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he would like a Bible study,

00:20:17.432 --> 00:20:20.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he wanted to convince
the other members of his church

00:20:20.569 --> 00:20:23.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to also study the Bible
with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:20:25.607 --> 00:20:27.609 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The fact was that this person

00:20:27.609 --> 00:20:30.379 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
had a certain influence in the church.

00:20:30.379 --> 00:20:32.648 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So he talked to the church members

00:20:32.648 --> 00:20:35.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the message
he had heard from the brother,

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:38.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he convinced them
that what they were missing

00:20:38.387 --> 00:20:40.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a better understanding of the Bible.

00:20:40.856 --> 00:20:42.891 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Many people heard about it

00:20:42.891 --> 00:20:45.394 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because it was an exceptional event.

00:20:45.394 --> 00:20:48.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From what I heard,
there were around a thousand people

00:20:48.664 --> 00:20:51.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who wanted to study
the Bible at that time.

00:20:51.066 --> 00:20:53.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t have
the brothers and sisters

00:20:53.602 --> 00:20:56.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were needed
to conduct all these Bible studies.

00:20:56.238 --> 00:21:00.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they formed groups
of 10, 12, 15 people.

00:21:00.175 --> 00:21:04.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And once or twice a week in Kingdom Halls,
they conducted Bible studies.

00:21:06.315 --> 00:21:08.150 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It was questions, questions.

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:10.319 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Everyone was asking questions.

00:21:13.989 --> 00:21:17.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the Bible could always answer
all these questions in a logical way

00:21:17.492 --> 00:21:19.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one verse would explain another.

00:21:19.895 --> 00:21:21.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we came to see

00:21:21.063 --> 00:21:25.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Bible in its entirety
could explain every subject.

00:21:25.434 --> 00:21:27.202 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
At the beginning,

00:21:27.202 --> 00:21:31.139 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
groups of two or three families studied together.

00:21:32.607 --> 00:21:34.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, yeah,
they answered with the Bible.

00:21:34.743 --> 00:21:37.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That amazed me because

00:21:37.145 --> 00:21:38.847 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know the Bible at all.

00:21:38.847 --> 00:21:41.216 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But I thought, ‘The Bible talks about this;

00:21:41.216 --> 00:21:42.517 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Bible talks about that.’

00:21:42.517 --> 00:21:45.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was like a discovery for me.

00:21:45.988 --> 00:21:47.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the parents.

00:21:47.556 --> 00:21:48.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The children weren’t there.

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:52.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we accepted it,
then we’d teach it to our children.

00:21:54.763 --> 00:21:57.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone was disciplined while sitting at the table.

00:21:57.966 --> 00:22:00.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The children were very quiet

00:22:00.135 --> 00:22:03.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their Truth book
in front of them and their Bible.

When these families
came to the Kingdom Hall,

00:22:05.707 --> 00:22:08.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the children were sitting beside their parents,

00:22:08.543 --> 00:22:11.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not moving, paying attention
to what was being said.

00:22:11.446 --> 00:22:13.982 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was young when they started coming.

00:22:13.982 --> 00:22:15.450 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I remember it very well.

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:16.885 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
A lot of them were my age.

00:22:17.753 --> 00:22:21.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw them like future potential friends.

00:22:21.423 --> 00:22:23.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was really touching.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:29.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first meeting
I attended was here in Laval.

00:22:29.865 --> 00:22:34.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really contributed to me
one day taking a stand

00:22:34.336 --> 00:22:37.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah becoming my God

00:22:37.039 --> 00:22:40.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the truth becoming my way of life.

00:22:44.379 --> 00:22:46.415 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When I was young,

00:22:46.415 --> 00:22:48.784 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was very afraid of death.

00:22:48.784 --> 00:22:53.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was such a relief to learn
that we don’t suffer when we die.

00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:56.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like a sleep.

00:22:56.658 --> 00:22:58.627 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The ambitions I had before,

00:22:58.627 --> 00:23:00.629 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that may have been attainable,

00:23:00.629 --> 00:23:03.231 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
became second place.

00:23:03.231 --> 00:23:05.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now it was to have a simple life,

00:23:05.434 --> 00:23:07.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to walk with the organization,

00:23:07.536 --> 00:23:10.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to raise my children in the truth.

00:23:10.906 --> 00:23:14.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, these brothers
are really doing a lot in the organization,

00:23:14.543 --> 00:23:18.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helping in different areas,
shouldering great responsibilities.

00:23:18.346 --> 00:23:20.615 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My father always strived

00:23:20.615 --> 00:23:23.051 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to set the example for all his children,

00:23:23.051 --> 00:23:25.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it made an impression on me.

00:23:25.253 --> 00:23:28.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now my wife and I have the privilege
of serving here at the Canada branch.

00:23:28.957 --> 00:23:30.759 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was eight years old

00:23:30.759 --> 00:23:32.961 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when my family started attending meetings.

00:23:32.961 --> 00:23:35.597 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I have really good memories of how

00:23:35.597 --> 00:23:37.432 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the local congregation at the time

00:23:37.432 --> 00:23:39.134 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
took care of us and looked after us.

00:23:39.134 --> 00:23:41.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the age of 15,

00:23:41.336 --> 00:23:44.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started reading my Bible every day
and studying it too.

00:23:44.639 --> 00:23:46.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From that point on,

00:23:46.608 --> 00:23:48.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew what I wanted to do with my life

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:50.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—serve Jehovah full-time.

00:23:55.117 --> 00:23:58.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really think Jehovah could see us on the inside.

00:24:03.158 --> 00:24:05.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah helped us a lot.

00:24:05.594 --> 00:24:08.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t have anything better than that.

00:24:13.101 --> 00:24:16.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On our own,
we never would have got out of that situation.

00:24:19.274 --> 00:24:23.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah found a way
to find “rightly disposed” ones.

00:24:23.145 --> 00:24:28.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A simple informal witness
led to Bible studies that touched so many.

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:37.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brother was able to give a good witness,

00:24:37.659 --> 00:24:41.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what motivated the church leader
to listen to him in the first place?

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:44.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the brother’s conduct.

00:24:44.533 --> 00:24:46.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was a very loving brother,

00:24:46.835 --> 00:24:50.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the way he dealt with others
in the workplace really impressed the man.

00:24:52.007 --> 00:24:56.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The poet said: “I’d rather see a sermon
than hear one any day.”

00:24:57.679 --> 00:25:01.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those words certainly proved true
in this exciting experience!

00:25:02.684 --> 00:25:06.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s an excellent transition
into the next part of our program.

00:25:06.922 --> 00:25:09.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this dramatization,

00:25:09.257 --> 00:25:13.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll see for ourselves
 how a Christian’s conduct, even at work,

00:25:13.461 --> 00:25:16.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can have a powerful effect
on those around them.

00:25:19.801 --> 00:25:24.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I really hate my job.

00:25:24.206 --> 00:25:28.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know how Jason stays so positive.

00:25:43.491 --> 00:25:46.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked Jason why he refused the money,

00:25:46.494 --> 00:25:49.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I found out
that he’s one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:25:49.264 --> 00:25:50.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife is too,

00:25:50.765 --> 00:25:53.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I know a lot about them.

00:25:53.368 --> 00:25:57.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what Jason did really surprised me.

00:25:59.841 --> 00:26:02.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wondered why he didn’t feel like

00:26:02.344 --> 00:26:04.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was entitled to the extra money.

00:26:04.379 --> 00:26:06.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s such a hard worker,

00:26:06.414 --> 00:26:09.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and most of our supervisors accept bribes.

00:26:09.651 --> 00:26:12.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jason showed me a Bible verse:

00:26:12.921 --> 00:26:16.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whatever you are doing,
work at it whole-souled

00:26:16.224 --> 00:26:20.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as for Jehovah, and not for men.”

00:26:20.328 --> 00:26:23.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jason’s relationship with God influences

00:26:23.031 --> 00:26:25.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every aspect of his life,

00:26:25.267 --> 00:26:28.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even his attitude toward work.

00:26:28.036 --> 00:26:30.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He couldn’t participate

00:26:30.372 --> 00:26:33.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in something dishonest, even if others did.

00:26:36.144 --> 00:26:40.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could see that Jason really lived by his beliefs.

00:26:59.834 --> 00:27:03.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jason invited me to see the construction project

00:27:03.138 --> 00:27:05.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s been volunteering at.

00:27:05.273 --> 00:27:08.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like I had entered another world.

00:27:08.777 --> 00:27:10.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People of different races

00:27:10.679 --> 00:27:12.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
worked alongside each other

00:27:12.881 --> 00:27:17.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without prejudice,
and they were all volunteers.

00:27:19.621 --> 00:27:23.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jason offered to study the Bible with me.

00:27:23.425 --> 00:27:26.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Emma has asked me to study in the past,

00:27:26.828 --> 00:27:29.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ve always refused.

00:27:39.774 --> 00:27:43.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this time, I accepted.

00:27:51.986 --> 00:27:54.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I liked my study

00:27:54.222 --> 00:27:57.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even enjoyed going
to the Kingdom Hall occasionally.

00:27:59.627 --> 00:28:02.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I had to work overtime

00:28:02.597 --> 00:28:05.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to support my family.

00:28:05.133 --> 00:28:07.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t go to meetings every week.

00:28:18.079 --> 00:28:19.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Jason,

00:28:19.814 --> 00:28:22.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how do you do it all

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:27.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—work, family, meetings, even volunteer work?

00:28:27.422 --> 00:28:32.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I try to keep in mind
Jesus’ words at Matthew 6:22.

00:28:35.997 --> 00:28:38.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus compared our eyes to a lamp.

00:28:39.768 --> 00:28:43.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that if ‘our eye was focused,
our whole body would be bright.’

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:47.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s impossible

00:28:47.175 --> 00:28:49.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to focus on more than one thing at a time.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:56.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus wanted his followers
to focus on a single purpose:

00:28:56.885 --> 00:28:58.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that of doing God’s will.

00:28:58.953 --> 00:29:02.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather than being distracted by material things,

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:04.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my wife and I lead a simple life,

00:29:04.292 --> 00:29:06.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
avoiding unnecessary debt

00:29:06.628 --> 00:29:11.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or acquiring possessions
that consume a lot of time and attention.

00:29:11.065 --> 00:29:15.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This way of life allows us
to have time for what’s truly important.

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:18.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you asked Emma,
which do you think she would prefer:

00:29:18.907 --> 00:29:22.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you made more money
or spent more time with her at the Kingdom Hall?

00:29:27.148 --> 00:29:29.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jason’s example really impressed me.

00:29:29.918 --> 00:29:34.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was an honest and diligent worker,

00:29:34.155 --> 00:29:38.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he also kept secular work in its proper place.

00:29:38.293 --> 00:29:41.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It made me think about the choices I make,

00:29:41.696 --> 00:29:44.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I decided that I too

00:29:44.399 --> 00:29:47.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wanted to ‘work whole-souled for Jehovah.’

00:29:48.736 --> 00:29:53.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James 2:17, 18, in part, states:

00:29:53.141 --> 00:29:58.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Faith by itself,
without works, is dead. . . .

00:29:58.079 --> 00:30:00.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Show me your faith without the works,

00:30:00.381 --> 00:30:05.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I will show you my faith by my works.”

00:30:05.086 --> 00:30:09.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the faith that Jason
displayed “by works” at his secular job

00:30:09.591 --> 00:30:14.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
motivated Thomas to accept a Bible study
and to continue to make spiritual progress

00:30:14.596 --> 00:30:16.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite setbacks.

00:30:16.764 --> 00:30:20.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeing this
and hearing of real-life examples,

00:30:20.235 --> 00:30:22.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as in our previous video,

00:30:22.403 --> 00:30:26.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are excellent reminders
of what a powerful witness

00:30:26.407 --> 00:30:28.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our actions can be.

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:33.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if we’re in a situation
where displaying faith

00:30:33.748 --> 00:30:38.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
calls for us to give up something
we previously loved or enjoyed?

00:30:39.587 --> 00:30:43.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The story of soccer player Andrey Nesmachniy

00:30:43.224 --> 00:30:46.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may help us to see what action to take.

00:30:50.565 --> 00:30:53.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soccer was my reason for living.

00:30:53.668 --> 00:30:56.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always dreamed of becoming
a professional soccer player.

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:03.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought that happiness came from fame,

00:31:07.782 --> 00:31:09.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a good career,

00:31:12.587 --> 00:31:14.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
money.

00:31:14.589 --> 00:31:18.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was six,
my parents signed me up for soccer.

00:31:20.828 --> 00:31:22.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really loved playing soccer.

00:31:22.497 --> 00:31:25.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I spent all my time at the stadium,
even late into the night.

00:31:26.768 --> 00:31:29.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 12,
I learned about Jehovah from my mom.

00:31:29.837 --> 00:31:31.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time,

00:31:31.439 --> 00:31:32.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she started studying the Bible.

00:31:32.941 --> 00:31:33.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after about a year,

00:31:33.942 --> 00:31:35.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to preach from door to door.

00:31:37.378 --> 00:31:39.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 17 years old,
I finished school

00:31:39.781 --> 00:31:44.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I received an invitation
from the Dynamo Soccer Club in Kiev.

00:31:44.352 --> 00:31:47.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, that was unforgettable!

00:31:47.889 --> 00:31:49.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, my emotions were running high

00:31:49.857 --> 00:31:52.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because since childhood
I had always dreamed of playing for Dynamo.

00:31:59.867 --> 00:32:02.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From that moment on,
all my energy and all my time

00:32:02.537 --> 00:32:04.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were devoted to my career.

00:32:11.346 --> 00:32:14.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every day we either trained or there was a game.

00:32:20.822 --> 00:32:24.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was no time left for spiritual things.

00:32:27.261 --> 00:32:30.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, being around people like that,
I became just like them.

00:32:34.836 --> 00:32:36.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I led an immoral lifestyle

00:32:36.704 --> 00:32:40.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because huge amounts of money
opened up many opportunities.

00:32:44.012 --> 00:32:47.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Going to nightclubs, the nightlife

00:32:47.148 --> 00:32:49.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it was so immoral.

00:32:50.718 --> 00:32:53.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone wants to be
your friend and to meet you.

00:32:53.655 --> 00:32:56.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, this was tempting.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also invested huge sums
of money in real estate.

00:33:08.603 --> 00:33:12.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to create a foundation
for the future and wealth for myself,

00:33:12.273 --> 00:33:16.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my family, and my relatives
so that no one would be in need.

00:33:17.478 --> 00:33:19.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, I was sure that this really was happiness.

00:33:21.482 --> 00:33:23.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This continued for nine years.

00:33:24.452 --> 00:33:26.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The turning point

00:33:26.454 --> 00:33:29.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a conversation with management
when an issue came up,

00:33:31.092 --> 00:33:33.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they hurled insults at me.

00:33:33.995 --> 00:33:36.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that moment, I felt worthless,

00:33:36.064 --> 00:33:38.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like a disposable cup

00:33:38.466 --> 00:33:41.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you use and then crush

00:33:41.235 --> 00:33:44.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and throw away.

00:33:44.038 --> 00:33:48.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, a new generation
of soccer players was arriving

00:33:48.276 --> 00:33:50.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—many young guys.

00:33:50.645 --> 00:33:53.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I stopped being included in the starting lineup.

00:33:54.916 --> 00:33:57.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, the financial crisis began,

00:33:57.351 --> 00:34:00.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and real estate prices fell drastically.

00:34:00.488 --> 00:34:04.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I panicked; I didn’t know what to do.

00:34:04.425 --> 00:34:07.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I started to think about the meaning of life:

00:34:07.495 --> 00:34:09.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What really is the meaning of life?

00:34:09.931 --> 00:34:12.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If it’s not a career, not money

00:34:12.233 --> 00:34:15.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—then what is it?’

00:34:15.136 --> 00:34:17.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then I remembered everything that I learned

00:34:17.505 --> 00:34:19.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Jehovah when I was a teenager.

00:34:19.674 --> 00:34:23.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to study
the Bible again along with my wife.

00:34:24.846 --> 00:34:27.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After a year, I started preaching again,
and in 2009,

00:34:27.849 --> 00:34:31.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:34:32.353 --> 00:34:35.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this brought me so much joy and satisfaction.

00:34:37.525 --> 00:34:41.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These feelings can’t be compared
to winning any medal or cup.

00:34:44.132 --> 00:34:46.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that I couldn’t slave for two masters,

00:34:48.369 --> 00:34:51.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I still had to play
two more years for Dynamo Kyiv.

00:34:53.407 --> 00:34:55.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although it was a difficult time,

00:34:55.676 --> 00:34:58.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I took advantage of this opportunity,

00:34:58.012 --> 00:35:00.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I am thankful to Jehovah that a good witness

00:35:00.848 --> 00:35:03.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was given about his name.

00:35:03.151 --> 00:35:06.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were some soccer players

00:35:06.053 --> 00:35:08.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who showed interest in the truth.

00:35:08.089 --> 00:35:12.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2011 when my contract ended,

00:35:12.393 --> 00:35:14.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I finished my professional career.

00:35:16.197 --> 00:35:18.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Timothy chapter 6

00:35:18.199 --> 00:35:22.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
encourages us “to place [our] hope,
not on uncertain riches,

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:25.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but on God,” and “to be rich in fine works.”

00:35:26.908 --> 00:35:29.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People ask me: “Do you regret it?”

00:35:29.677 --> 00:35:33.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Maybe you’d like to come back;
do you miss soccer?”

00:35:33.114 --> 00:35:36.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I honestly and sincerely say no.

00:35:36.517 --> 00:35:38.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t miss it, and I don’t want to go back

00:35:38.986 --> 00:35:42.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because my relationship with Jehovah—

00:35:42.323 --> 00:35:45.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it can’t be compared to anything.

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:49.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything that this world offers is all short-lived,

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:52.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s only an illusion.

00:35:52.166 --> 00:35:56.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People see only one side of the picture
—the fame and the money.

00:35:56.604 --> 00:35:59.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The other side are
the injuries and disappointments.

00:35:59.774 --> 00:36:03.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s very hard psychologically and emotionally;

00:36:03.544 --> 00:36:05.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have no freedom.

00:36:07.215 --> 00:36:10.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why it’s better
to give the very best to the One

00:36:10.084 --> 00:36:12.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who appreciates it.

00:36:12.286 --> 00:36:15.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What you do for Jehovah
will always bring you happiness,

00:36:15.957 --> 00:36:18.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
joy, and satisfaction.

00:36:23.064 --> 00:36:27.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how Andrey mentioned
that he couldn’t “slave for two masters,”

00:36:27.668 --> 00:36:32.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this led him to eventually
abandon the world of professional sports?

00:36:32.673 --> 00:36:37.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, often our faith moves us to leave behind

00:36:37.545 --> 00:36:40.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
careers and activities we once loved.

00:36:40.748 --> 00:36:45.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to quote Paul’s words at Philippians 3:8:

00:36:45.553 --> 00:36:48.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have taken the loss of all things

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:51.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I consider them as a lot of refuse

00:36:51.492 --> 00:36:55.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[or as the footnote states,
“garbage; rubbish.”],

00:36:55.796 --> 00:36:57.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I may gain Christ.”

00:36:58.366 --> 00:37:00.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can have confidence
that anything we throw away

00:37:00.935 --> 00:37:03.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the sake of our spirituality

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:07.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has no real value
when we compare it to the blessings

00:37:07.241 --> 00:37:09.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we enjoy as Jehovah’s friends.

00:37:09.877 --> 00:37:11.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Back to you, David.

00:37:11.879 --> 00:37:13.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks, Herman.
That was great.

00:37:16.083 --> 00:37:18.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For my second discussion on this broadcast,

00:37:18.986 --> 00:37:23.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to talk to you
on the theme “Do the Math.”

00:37:23.224 --> 00:37:28.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, you heard right: “Do the Math.”

00:37:28.162 --> 00:37:31.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, math may not be your favorite subject,

00:37:31.832 --> 00:37:35.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but as we’re going to see,
someone has to do it.

00:37:35.202 --> 00:37:39.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes doing the math
is the only way we can make a time line

00:37:39.407 --> 00:37:41.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or get interesting background information

00:37:41.642 --> 00:37:44.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that makes our Bible reading more enjoyable.

00:37:44.512 --> 00:37:48.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you do want to make
your Bible reading more enjoyable, don’t you?

00:37:48.316 --> 00:37:50.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course you do!

00:37:50.484 --> 00:37:52.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s start with a number

00:37:52.553 --> 00:37:55.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we might quickly skip over
in our Bible reading.

00:37:55.056 --> 00:37:59.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn to Matthew 19:28,

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:02.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s see how a number

00:38:02.363 --> 00:38:06.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can sometimes tell us
more than what’s written on the page.

00:38:06.567 --> 00:38:09.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 19:28:

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:13.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jesus said to them: ‘Truly I say to you,

00:38:13.874 --> 00:38:16.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘in the re-creation,

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:19.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘when the Son of man
sits down on his glorious throne,

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:24.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘you who have followed me
will sit on 12 thrones,

00:38:24.251 --> 00:38:28.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
judging the 12 tribes of Israel.’”

00:38:28.089 --> 00:38:30.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see anything interesting there?

00:38:32.526 --> 00:38:34.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll give you a hint:

00:38:34.862 --> 00:38:37.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These words were spoken near the end

00:38:37.665 --> 00:38:40.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jesus’ earthly ministry.

00:38:40.801 --> 00:38:43.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does that give you a hint?

00:38:43.104 --> 00:38:47.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll give you another hint: the number 12.

00:38:48.175 --> 00:38:50.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At this point, Jesus knew

00:38:50.911 --> 00:38:54.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that only 11 of his apostles
were going to be faithful.

00:38:54.482 --> 00:38:59.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, he said there would be
12 thrones in the Kingdom, not 11.

00:38:59.053 --> 00:39:01.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did it mean?

00:39:01.055 --> 00:39:05.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It meant that Judas
would have to be replaced as an apostle.

00:39:05.359 --> 00:39:08.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And sure enough, he was.

00:39:08.562 --> 00:39:10.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that was easy, wasn’t it?

00:39:10.564 --> 00:39:12.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was no math involved.

00:39:12.199 --> 00:39:13.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just a number.

00:39:13.834 --> 00:39:18.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, let’s see how doing the math
can help us to answer a few questions.

00:39:20.074 --> 00:39:23.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During family worship, one of the kids asks

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:26.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether Noah and Abraham knew each other.

00:39:27.581 --> 00:39:29.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How are you going to handle that?

00:39:29.283 --> 00:39:31.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know?

00:39:31.919 --> 00:39:33.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might just say,

00:39:33.287 --> 00:39:35.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The Bible doesn’t say” and leave it at that.

00:39:35.689 --> 00:39:37.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you could figure it out

00:39:37.992 --> 00:39:40.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you did the math.

00:39:40.194 --> 00:39:43.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s what we know:

00:39:43.264 --> 00:39:47.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Flood occurred in 2370 B.C.E.

00:39:47.968 --> 00:39:50.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that date is absolutely solid.

00:39:50.504 --> 00:39:52.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you’d like
to figure it out for yourself,

00:39:52.907 --> 00:39:55.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can look it up under “Chronology”

00:39:55.242 --> 00:39:59.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Insight book—2370 B.C.E.

00:39:59.146 --> 00:40:00.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the Flood.

00:40:00.614 --> 00:40:05.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Noah lived for 350 years after the Flood.

00:40:05.619 --> 00:40:10.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So by subtracting 350 from 2370,

00:40:10.224 --> 00:40:15.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we learn that Noah died in 2020 B.C.E.

00:40:15.129 --> 00:40:17.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But remember the question?

00:40:17.131 --> 00:40:21.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The question is,
Did Noah and Abram know each other?

00:40:23.237 --> 00:40:26.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abram entered the land of Canaan

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:29.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 1943 B.C.E.

00:40:29.643 --> 00:40:32.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, once again,
if you want to prove that to yourself,

00:40:32.246 --> 00:40:34.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
look in Insight under “Chronology.”

00:40:34.381 --> 00:40:37.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll find everything
you need to prove it to yourself.

00:40:37.618 --> 00:40:40.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in 1943 B.C.E., Abraham

00:40:40.721 --> 00:40:42.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(Abram in that case)

00:40:42.756 --> 00:40:45.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enters the land of Canaan

00:40:45.359 --> 00:40:48.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s 75 years old at the time.

00:40:48.929 --> 00:40:51.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Abram must have been born

00:40:51.198 --> 00:40:54.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
75 years before 1943 B.C.E.

00:40:54.768 --> 00:40:58.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Add 75 to 1943,

00:40:58.205 --> 00:41:00.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you find that Abram was born

00:41:00.307 --> 00:41:03.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 2018 B.C.E.

00:41:03.377 --> 00:41:06.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Noah died in 2020 B.C.E.,

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:10.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Abram was born
two years later, in 2018 B.C.E.

00:41:10.684 --> 00:41:14.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They never knew each other, but it was close.

00:41:16.724 --> 00:41:18.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our publications have often said

00:41:18.726 --> 00:41:23.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jonathan was
at least 30 years older than David.

00:41:23.531 --> 00:41:25.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the Bible doesn’t say that.

00:41:25.833 --> 00:41:27.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your progressive Bible student

00:41:27.968 --> 00:41:30.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(you know, the one
who makes you prove everything)

00:41:30.571 --> 00:41:32.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
asks you about that.

00:41:32.473 --> 00:41:34.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you prove it?

00:41:34.475 --> 00:41:36.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you?

00:41:36.243 --> 00:41:39.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can if you do the math.

00:41:39.246 --> 00:41:43.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King Saul ruled Israel for 40 years.

00:41:43.284 --> 00:41:45.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then David became king.

00:41:45.519 --> 00:41:48.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how old was David
when he became king?

00:41:48.189 --> 00:41:51.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible says that he “was 30 years old.”

00:41:51.525 --> 00:41:54.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means that when David was born,

00:41:54.495 --> 00:41:58.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saul had already been ruling
Israel for ten years.

00:41:58.966 --> 00:42:02.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when Saul became king,
Jonathan was a grown man.

00:42:02.836 --> 00:42:05.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was probably already in the army.

00:42:05.372 --> 00:42:08.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You had to be
at least 20 years old to be in the army.

00:42:08.809 --> 00:42:12.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if Jonathan was at least 20

00:42:12.246 --> 00:42:17.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Saul began to rule
and David was born 10 years after that,

00:42:17.184 --> 00:42:19.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what difference in age would there have been

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:22.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between Jonathan and David?

00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:25.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About a 30-year difference

00:42:25.426 --> 00:42:28.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—20 plus 10 equals 30.

00:42:29.663 --> 00:42:31.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the next one

00:42:31.665 --> 00:42:35.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a bit more complicated;
it’s the last one.

00:42:35.102 --> 00:42:37.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can do this.

00:42:37.171 --> 00:42:39.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Insight on the Scriptures says

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:43.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Moses and Job lived at the same time.

00:42:43.077 --> 00:42:45.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the Bible doesn’t say that.

00:42:45.813 --> 00:42:48.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we be so sure?

00:42:48.449 --> 00:42:51.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once again, what do we do?

00:42:51.218 --> 00:42:53.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do I hear it?

00:42:53.254 --> 00:42:56.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re right; we do the math.

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:59.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Job’s test must have occurred

00:42:59.326 --> 00:43:02.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometime after the death of Joseph.

00:43:02.162 --> 00:43:05.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that because in Job chapter 1,

00:43:05.232 --> 00:43:06.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah told Satan:

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There is no one like [Job] on the earth.”

00:43:09.903 --> 00:43:11.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No one.”

00:43:11.272 --> 00:43:13.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if Joseph had still been alive,

00:43:13.641 --> 00:43:18.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah would have said that there was
no one like Joseph and Job on the earth.

00:43:18.646 --> 00:43:20.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if the test had occurred earlier,

00:43:20.948 --> 00:43:25.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah would have said
that there was no one like Jacob and Job,

00:43:25.252 --> 00:43:28.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaac and Job, Abraham and Job.

00:43:28.856 --> 00:43:33.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And remember, there were
only two years between Noah and Abraham,

00:43:33.827 --> 00:43:36.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we can conclude that the test of Job

00:43:36.764 --> 00:43:40.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
occurred after the death of Joseph.

00:43:40.234 --> 00:43:42.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When did Joseph die?

00:43:42.936 --> 00:43:45.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The date is solid.

00:43:45.339 --> 00:43:48.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s 1657 B.C.E.

00:43:48.942 --> 00:43:51.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we figure that?

00:43:51.478 --> 00:43:56.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you don’t like math, trust me,
you don’t want to know!

00:43:56.250 --> 00:43:59.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Insight and the Bible will give you

00:43:59.019 --> 00:44:01.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the information you need
to figure it out for yourself.

00:44:01.955 --> 00:44:03.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s keep it simple.

00:44:03.957 --> 00:44:07.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go with 1657 B.C.E.

00:44:07.961 --> 00:44:12.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s 144 years before Israel left Egypt

00:44:12.966 --> 00:44:17.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under the direction of Moses in 1513 B.C.E.

00:44:17.971 --> 00:44:21.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Job’s test must have occurred

00:44:21.742 --> 00:44:26.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometime within that 144-year period.

00:44:26.046 --> 00:44:28.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now this is a big hint:

00:44:28.916 --> 00:44:33.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
144 years before Israel left Egypt.

00:44:33.921 --> 00:44:37.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you beginning to put it together?

00:44:37.057 --> 00:44:39.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here is the clincher:

00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:43.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Job lived for 140 years

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:45.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after he passed the test,

00:44:45.532 --> 00:44:48.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so he was probably still alive
in the land of Uz

00:44:48.535 --> 00:44:50.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Israel left Egypt.

00:44:50.571 --> 00:44:53.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Conclusion: Job and Moses

00:44:53.941 --> 00:44:56.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
definitely lived at the same time.

00:44:58.011 --> 00:45:01.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what have we learned by doing the math?

00:45:01.248 --> 00:45:03.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Superficially, we might say:

00:45:03.417 --> 00:45:08.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, we’ve learned that Abraham
was born two years after Noah.

00:45:08.422 --> 00:45:13.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And we’ve proved that Jonathan  
was at least 30 years older than David

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:17.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that Moses and Job
definitely lived at the same time.”

00:45:17.064 --> 00:45:21.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Superficially, we got the answers
to those questions, yes.

00:45:21.101 --> 00:45:23.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the fact is

00:45:23.103 --> 00:45:25.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that probably none
of those questions ever kept you up at night.

00:45:27.174 --> 00:45:29.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a broader picture here.

00:45:29.410 --> 00:45:31.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we’d like you to take away

00:45:31.979 --> 00:45:35.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the fact that sometimes a number
is more than just a number.

00:45:35.916 --> 00:45:39.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can provide information
that we couldn’t get any other way,

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:42.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if we can understand that,

00:45:42.022 --> 00:45:46.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this discussion will have been
well worth having.

00:45:46.026 --> 00:45:48.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when you see a number in the Bible,

00:45:48.862 --> 00:45:50.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t run the other way.

00:45:50.864 --> 00:45:53.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Embrace it; stop and think about it.

00:45:53.867 --> 00:45:55.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may be glad you did.

00:45:56.970 --> 00:46:01.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, after all that math,
how about a little music?

00:46:02.376 --> 00:46:06.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This month’s music video
will let us experience some of the joy

00:46:06.246 --> 00:46:09.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of traveling to an international convention

00:46:09.116 --> 00:46:12.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meeting our spiritual family members
from around the globe.

00:46:27.901 --> 00:46:34.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Touching down in a foreign land
With a thousand miles behind us—

00:46:34.842 --> 00:46:37.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since we left our home,

00:46:37.077 --> 00:46:42.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Jehovah’s hand
That is blessing ev’ry move.

00:46:42.182 --> 00:46:49.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the work that we do isn’t easy,
But it’s all for Jehovah.

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:53.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the love that we feel
for this fam’ly is real,

00:46:53.427 --> 00:46:57.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this we say to you:

00:46:57.798 --> 00:47:05.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We’re all Jehovah’s people;
United, we are family.

00:47:05.539 --> 00:47:10.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And though your land is far away,
We love you.

00:47:10.878 --> 00:47:15.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re your family.”

00:47:15.782 --> 00:47:23.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Waiting there as our plane came in,
You were reaching out to greet us.

00:47:23.123 --> 00:47:30.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then the music starts, and the day begins,
And our love grows even more.

00:47:30.297 --> 00:47:37.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we know that it’s only Jehovah
Who can cause this to happen.

00:47:37.671 --> 00:47:41.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’ll praise him together
and love him forever

00:47:41.708 --> 00:47:45.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On ev’ry distant shore.

00:47:45.846 --> 00:47:53.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We’re all Jehovah’s people;
United, we are family.

00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:58.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And though your land is far away,
We love you.

00:47:58.692 --> 00:48:02.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re your family.”

00:48:03.997 --> 00:48:10.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Silver wings fly across the sea
To a land so unfamiliar.

00:48:10.871 --> 00:48:18.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we bring good news, and the ones we meet
Are so gentle, kind, and good.

00:48:18.045 --> 00:48:25.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the love we receive from our brothers
Makes us feel we belong here.

00:48:25.619 --> 00:48:33.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So wherever we are and no matter how far,
We love our brotherhood!

00:48:48.809 --> 00:48:56.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s good to know
That we have family ev’rywhere we go—

00:48:56.283 --> 00:49:02.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From Mali to Mexico,
From Japan to Jamaica.

00:49:05.258 --> 00:49:12.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We’re all Jehovah’s people;
United, we are family.

00:49:12.766 --> 00:49:18.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And though your land is far away,
We love you.

00:49:18.005 --> 00:49:20.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We’re your family.

00:49:20.207 --> 00:49:27.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“From ev’ry tribe and nation—
United, we are family.

00:49:27.614 --> 00:49:35.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“These bonds of love are plain to see
Because we’re Jehovah’s family!

00:49:49.302 --> 00:49:56.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Fiji, Tahiti, and New Caledonia—
Navajo, Blackfoot, and Cherokee—

00:49:56.376 --> 00:50:02.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Estonia—
We love you.

00:50:02.783 --> 00:50:06.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re your family.”

00:50:08.121 --> 00:50:11.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That song really captures
the excitement that we feel

00:50:11.692 --> 00:50:14.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we meet new members of our family.

00:50:14.094 --> 00:50:16.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I certainly agree.
It was great.

00:50:17.364 --> 00:50:20.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this month we saw how our actions

00:50:20.701 --> 00:50:24.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can help motivate
right-hearted ones to accept the truth.

00:50:24.404 --> 00:50:28.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We peeked behind the scenes
to learn how translation work is done.

00:50:28.575 --> 00:50:32.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we even did a little math.

00:50:32.079 --> 00:50:35.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Herman, I love working with you
in the Writing Department,

00:50:35.882 --> 00:50:38.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I loved working with you
on this project this month.

00:50:38.719 --> 00:50:40.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, David.

00:50:40.053 --> 00:50:41.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, thank you.

00:50:41.388 --> 00:50:43.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really appreciate your help.

00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:47.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I’ve been informed
that many of you will be notified

00:50:47.027 --> 00:50:50.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the dates
for your regional convention this month.

00:50:50.063 --> 00:50:54.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to know the theme
for the 2020 convention program?

00:50:54.668 --> 00:50:58.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll lower my voice,
and I’ll let you in on it.

00:50:58.572 --> 00:51:02.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The program is based on Philippians 4:4

00:51:02.576 --> 00:51:06.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the theme “Always Rejoice”!

00:51:06.279 --> 00:51:08.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that a great theme?

00:51:08.281 --> 00:51:11.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to have a great time
advertising this convention theme.

00:51:11.852 --> 00:51:14.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine having that
on your convention badge?

00:51:14.488 --> 00:51:17.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And people will look at that badge
and they’ll say,

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:19.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What do you have to be so happy about?”

00:51:19.593 --> 00:51:21.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we’ll tell them.

00:51:21.595 --> 00:51:23.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But before we end the program,

00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:25.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s join Herman

00:51:25.732 --> 00:51:30.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a short visit to the country of Botswana
in the southern part of Africa.

00:51:31.905 --> 00:51:36.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Botswana is home to many natural wonders.

00:51:36.276 --> 00:51:38.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Among them is the Okavango Delta,

00:51:38.645 --> 00:51:41.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a natural haven for wildlife.

00:51:41.481 --> 00:51:44.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This country is also the home
of the highest concentration

00:51:44.918 --> 00:51:46.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of elephants in the world.

00:51:46.686 --> 00:51:49.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, when it comes to people,

00:51:49.222 --> 00:51:52.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are only
about two and a half million residents

00:51:52.159 --> 00:51:56.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spread out over this very large country.

00:51:56.163 --> 00:51:59.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with only 2,316 publishers,

00:51:59.533 --> 00:52:02.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the ratio of Witnesses to residents

00:52:02.502 --> 00:52:04.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is about 1 to 1,000.

00:52:05.472 --> 00:52:07.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they always enjoy it

00:52:07.507 --> 00:52:10.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when need-greaters offer to come

00:52:10.544 --> 00:52:12.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and assist them as they cover hundreds

00:52:12.579 --> 00:52:16.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of kilometers of unassigned territory
on preaching trips that can

00:52:16.449 --> 00:52:18.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
last for days or even for weeks

00:52:18.952 --> 00:52:22.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to reach the most remote villages.

00:52:22.889 --> 00:52:26.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Currently, there are 45 congregations
and 2 isolated groups.

00:52:26.993 --> 00:52:31.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Etsha Congregation,
located in the Okavango Moremi area,

00:52:31.998 --> 00:52:35.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is small with only
seven publishers and no elders.

00:52:36.736 --> 00:52:38.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the zeal of these publishers

00:52:38.805 --> 00:52:42.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is amazing as they travel long distances,

00:52:42.809 --> 00:52:45.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
often on foot, just to attend meetings.

00:52:45.478 --> 00:52:49.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This travel isn’t only difficult
because of the distance

00:52:49.182 --> 00:52:52.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also because wild animals
roam freely in the area.

00:52:53.253 --> 00:52:55.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regardless of the challenges,

00:52:55.322 --> 00:52:57.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers and sisters
enjoy coming together

00:52:57.924 --> 00:53:00.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve Jehovah
and to share in the ministry.

00:53:00.927 --> 00:53:02.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This congregation is just

00:53:02.963 --> 00:53:06.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one of many examples
of the faithful brothers and sisters

00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:09.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
throughout Botswana

00:53:09.035 --> 00:53:13.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are spreading the truth
into even the most remote locations.

00:53:13.473 --> 00:53:18.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they want to share
their love and greetings with all of you.

00:53:18.879 --> 00:53:22.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We send our love to all
of our brothers and sisters in Botswana

00:53:22.749 --> 00:53:25.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to all of you wherever you might be.

00:53:25.752 --> 00:53:28.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love you all very much.

00:53:28.355 --> 00:53:30.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Until next time,

00:53:30.357 --> 00:53:33.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is JW Broadcasting

00:53:33.226 --> 00:53:36.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
