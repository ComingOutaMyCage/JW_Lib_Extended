00:00:01.317 --> 00:00:05.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to talk to you
on the theme “Do the Math.”

00:00:05.555 --> 00:00:10.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, you heard right: “Do the Math.”

00:00:10.493 --> 00:00:14.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, math may not be your favorite subject,

00:00:14.164 --> 00:00:17.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but as we’re going to see,
someone has to do it.

00:00:17.534 --> 00:00:21.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes doing the math
is the only way we can make a time line

00:00:21.738 --> 00:00:23.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or get interesting background information

00:00:23.973 --> 00:00:26.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that makes our Bible reading more enjoyable.

00:00:26.843 --> 00:00:30.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you do want to make
your Bible reading more enjoyable, don’t you?

00:00:30.647 --> 00:00:32.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course you do!

00:00:32.816 --> 00:00:34.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s start with a number

00:00:34.884 --> 00:00:37.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we might quickly skip over
in our Bible reading.

00:00:37.387 --> 00:00:41.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn to Matthew 19:28,

00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:44.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s see how a number

00:00:44.694 --> 00:00:48.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can sometimes tell us
more than what’s written on the page.

00:00:48.898 --> 00:00:51.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 19:28:

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:56.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jesus said to them: ‘Truly I say to you,

00:00:56.206 --> 00:00:58.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘in the re-creation,

00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:01.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘when the Son of man
sits down on his glorious throne,

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:06.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘you who have followed me
will sit on 12 thrones,

00:01:06.583 --> 00:01:10.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
judging the 12 tribes of Israel.’”

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see anything interesting there?

00:01:14.858 --> 00:01:17.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll give you a hint:

00:01:17.193 --> 00:01:19.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These words were spoken near the end

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:23.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jesus’ earthly ministry.

00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does that give you a hint?

00:01:25.435 --> 00:01:29.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll give you another hint: the number 12.

00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:33.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At this point, Jesus knew

00:01:33.243 --> 00:01:36.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that only 11 of his apostles
were going to be faithful.

00:01:36.813 --> 00:01:41.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, he said there would be
12 thrones in the Kingdom, not 11.

00:01:41.384 --> 00:01:43.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did it mean?

00:01:43.386 --> 00:01:47.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It meant that Judas
would have to be replaced as an apostle.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And sure enough, he was.

00:01:50.894 --> 00:01:52.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that was easy, wasn’t it?

00:01:52.896 --> 00:01:54.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was no math involved.

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:56.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just a number.

00:01:56.166 --> 00:02:01.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, let’s see how doing the math
can help us to answer a few questions.

00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:05.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During family worship, one of the kids asks

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:08.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether Noah and Abraham knew each other.

00:02:09.913 --> 00:02:11.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How are you going to handle that?

00:02:11.614 --> 00:02:13.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know?

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might just say,

00:02:15.618 --> 00:02:18.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The Bible doesn’t say” and leave it at that.

00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:20.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you could figure it out

00:02:20.323 --> 00:02:22.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you did the math.

00:02:22.525 --> 00:02:25.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s what we know:

00:02:25.595 --> 00:02:30.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Flood occurred in 2370 B.C.E.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that date is absolutely solid.

00:02:32.836 --> 00:02:35.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you’d like
to figure it out for yourself,

00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:37.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can look it up under “Chronology”

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:41.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Insight<i> </i>book—2370 B.C.E.

00:02:41.477 --> 00:02:42.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the Flood.

00:02:42.946 --> 00:02:47.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Noah lived for 350 years after the Flood.

00:02:47.951 --> 00:02:52.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So by subtracting 350 from 2370,

00:02:52.555 --> 00:02:57.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we learn that Noah died in 2020 B.C.E.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But remember the question?

00:02:59.462 --> 00:03:03.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The question is,
Did Noah and Abram know each other?

00:03:05.568 --> 00:03:08.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abram entered the land of Canaan

00:03:08.671 --> 00:03:11.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 1943 B.C.E.

00:03:11.975 --> 00:03:14.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, once again,
if you want to prove that to yourself,

00:03:14.577 --> 00:03:16.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
look in Insight<i> </i>under “Chronology.”

00:03:16.713 --> 00:03:19.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll find everything
you need to prove it to yourself.

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:23.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in 1943 B.C.E., Abraham

00:03:23.052 --> 00:03:25.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(Abram in that case)

00:03:25.088 --> 00:03:27.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enters the land of Canaan

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s 75 years old at the time.

00:03:31.261 --> 00:03:33.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Abram must have been born

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:37.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
75 years before 1943 B.C.E.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Add 75 to 1943,

00:03:40.536 --> 00:03:42.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you find that Abram was born

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 2018 B.C.E.

00:03:45.708 --> 00:03:48.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Noah died in 2020 B.C.E.,

00:03:48.912 --> 00:03:53.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Abram was born
two years later, in 2018 B.C.E.

00:03:53.016 --> 00:03:56.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They never knew each other, but it was close.

00:03:59.055 --> 00:04:01.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our publications have often said

00:04:01.057 --> 00:04:05.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jonathan was
at least 30 years older than David.

00:04:05.862 --> 00:04:08.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the Bible doesn’t say that.

00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:10.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your progressive Bible student

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(you know, the one
who makes you prove everything)

00:04:12.902 --> 00:04:14.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
asks you about that.

00:04:14.804 --> 00:04:16.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you prove it?

00:04:16.806 --> 00:04:18.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you?

00:04:18.574 --> 00:04:21.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can if you do the math.

00:04:21.577 --> 00:04:25.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King Saul ruled Israel for 40 years.

00:04:25.615 --> 00:04:27.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then David became king.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how old was David
when he became king?

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible says that he “was 30 years old.”

00:04:33.856 --> 00:04:36.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means that when David was born,

00:04:36.826 --> 00:04:41.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saul had already been ruling
Israel for ten years.

00:04:41.297 --> 00:04:45.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when Saul became king,
Jonathan was a grown man.

00:04:45.168 --> 00:04:47.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was probably already in the army.

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:51.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You had to be
at least 20 years old to be in the army.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if Jonathan was at least 20

00:04:54.577 --> 00:04:59.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Saul began to rule
and David was born 10 years after that,

00:04:59.515 --> 00:05:01.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what difference in age would there have been

00:05:01.951 --> 00:05:04.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between Jonathan and David?

00:05:04.921 --> 00:05:07.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About a 30-year difference

00:05:07.757 --> 00:05:10.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—20 plus 10 equals 30.

00:05:11.995 --> 00:05:13.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the next one

00:05:13.997 --> 00:05:17.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a bit more complicated;
it’s the last one.

00:05:17.433 --> 00:05:19.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can do this. 

00:05:19.502 --> 00:05:22.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Insight on the Scriptures says

00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:25.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Moses and Job lived at the same time.

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:28.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the Bible doesn’t say that.

00:05:28.144 --> 00:05:30.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we be so sure?

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once again, what do we do?

00:05:33.549 --> 00:05:35.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do I hear it?

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:39.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re right; we do the math.

00:05:39.022 --> 00:05:41.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Job’s test must have occurred

00:05:41.657 --> 00:05:44.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometime after the death of Joseph.

00:05:44.494 --> 00:05:47.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that because in Job chapter 1,

00:05:47.563 --> 00:05:49.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah told Satan:

00:05:49.132 --> 00:05:52.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There is no one like [Job] on the earth.”

00:05:52.235 --> 00:05:53.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No one.”

00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:55.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if Joseph had still been alive,

00:05:55.972 --> 00:06:00.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah would have said that there was
no one like Joseph and Job on the earth.

00:06:00.977 --> 00:06:03.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if the test had occurred earlier,

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:07.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah would have said
that there was no one like Jacob and Job,

00:06:07.583 --> 00:06:11.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaac and Job, Abraham and Job.

00:06:11.187 --> 00:06:16.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And remember, there were
only two years between Noah and Abraham,

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:19.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we can conclude that the test of Job

00:06:19.095 --> 00:06:22.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
occurred after the death of Joseph.

00:06:22.565 --> 00:06:25.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When did Joseph die?

00:06:25.268 --> 00:06:27.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The date is solid.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s 1657 B.C.E.

00:06:31.274 --> 00:06:33.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we figure that?

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you don’t like math, trust me,
you don’t want to know!

00:06:38.581 --> 00:06:41.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Insight<i> </i>and the Bible will give you

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the information you need
to figure it out for yourself.

00:06:44.287 --> 00:06:46.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s keep it simple.

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:50.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go with 1657 B.C.E.

00:06:50.293 --> 00:06:55.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s 144 years before Israel left Egypt

00:06:55.298 --> 00:07:00.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under the direction of Moses in 1513 B.C.E.

00:07:00.303 --> 00:07:04.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Job’s test must have occurred

00:07:04.073 --> 00:07:08.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometime within that 144-year period.

00:07:08.377 --> 00:07:11.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now this is a big hint:

00:07:11.247 --> 00:07:16.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
144 years before Israel left Egypt.

00:07:16.252 --> 00:07:19.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you beginning to put it together?

00:07:19.388 --> 00:07:21.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here is the clincher:

00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:25.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Job lived for 140 years

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:27.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after he passed the test,

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:30.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so he was probably still alive
in the land of Uz

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:32.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Israel left Egypt.

00:07:32.902 --> 00:07:36.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Conclusion: Job and Moses

00:07:36.272 --> 00:07:39.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
definitely lived at the same time.

00:07:40.343 --> 00:07:43.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what have we learned by doing the math?

00:07:43.579 --> 00:07:45.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Superficially, we might say:

00:07:45.748 --> 00:07:50.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, we’ve learned that Abraham
was born two years after Noah.

00:07:50.753 --> 00:07:55.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And we’ve proved that Jonathan  
was at least 30 years older than David

00:07:55.691 --> 00:07:59.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that Moses and Job
definitely lived at the same time.”

00:07:59.395 --> 00:08:03.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Superficially, we got the answers
to those questions, yes.

00:08:03.432 --> 00:08:05.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the fact is

00:08:05.434 --> 00:08:08.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that probably none
of those questions ever kept you up at night.

00:08:09.505 --> 00:08:11.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a broader picture here.

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:14.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we’d like you to take away

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:18.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the fact that sometimes a number
is more than just a number.

00:08:18.247 --> 00:08:21.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can provide information
that we couldn’t get any other way,

00:08:21.951 --> 00:08:24.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if we can understand that,

00:08:24.353 --> 00:08:28.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this discussion will have been
well worth having.

00:08:28.357 --> 00:08:31.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when you see a number in the Bible,

00:08:31.194 --> 00:08:33.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t run the other way.

00:08:33.196 --> 00:08:36.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Embrace it; stop and think about it.

00:08:36.199 --> 00:08:38.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may be glad you did.
