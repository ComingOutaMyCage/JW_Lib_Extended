Our broadcast this month has the theme

00:00:03.353 --> 00:00:06.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Cherish Your Privilege of Prayer.”

00:00:06.256 --> 00:00:08.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think it’s appropriate

00:00:08.391 --> 00:00:11.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to label prayer as a miracle?

00:00:12.262 --> 00:00:13.797 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Miracles are described

00:00:13.797 --> 00:00:15.699 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in our New World Translation

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:17.834 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Glossary of Bible Terms”

00:00:17.834 --> 00:00:21.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “actions or phenomena

00:00:21.237 --> 00:00:23.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that surpass all powers

00:00:23.573 --> 00:00:26.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“known to humans and are attributed

00:00:26.843 --> 00:00:29.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a supernatural agency.”

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does prayer fit that description?

00:00:33.416 --> 00:00:35.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The moment you say a prayer,

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:38.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your innermost thoughts and feelings

00:00:38.988 --> 00:00:41.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are communicated instantly to the Creator

00:00:41.558 --> 00:00:43.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from wherever you are

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even if you pray silently.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s certainly
beyond any power that humans know.

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:53.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, the fact that a human

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can call out to God in prayer

00:00:55.572 --> 00:00:57.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be heard by him

00:00:57.807 --> 00:01:00.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is truly a miracle.

00:01:00.944 --> 00:01:05.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s only
by the undeserved kindness of Jehovah 

00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:09.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can approach
his heavenly throne in prayer.

00:01:09.552 --> 00:01:13.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today our lives are very complicated

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:16.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, in some cases, very troubled.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether young or old, there are times

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may feel overwhelmed with our problems.

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:28.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At other times,
we may simply feel alone and helpless.

00:01:28.772 --> 00:01:31.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we do?

00:01:31.074 --> 00:01:35.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul says that prayer will help.

00:01:35.478 --> 00:01:39.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bible to Philippians 4:6

00:01:39.382 --> 00:01:43.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and listen
to his spirit-inspired recommendations:

00:01:44.788 --> 00:01:48.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be anxious over anything,

00:01:48.124 --> 00:01:51.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but in everything by prayer and supplication

00:01:51.928 --> 00:01:54.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“along with thanksgiving,

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let your petitions be made known to God.”

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Paul is saying
that in all circumstances of life,

00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:03.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prayer is essential.

00:02:03.773 --> 00:02:06.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While no one around us

00:02:06.176 --> 00:02:10.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can see the inner struggles we may be having,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sees them.

00:02:12.315 --> 00:02:14.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will he do?

00:02:14.317 --> 00:02:16.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read verse 7:

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And the peace of God
that surpasses all understanding

00:02:21.457 --> 00:02:24.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will guard your hearts
and your mental powers

00:02:24.761 --> 00:02:26.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of Christ Jesus.”

00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:30.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This incomparable “peace of God”

00:02:30.867 --> 00:02:33.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is an unusual tranquillity

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enjoyed by Jehovah’s dedicated servants,

00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:40.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even in the most trying circumstances.

00:02:40.743 --> 00:02:43.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you felt that inner peace

00:02:43.346 --> 00:02:47.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that results
from intimate communication with Jehovah?

00:02:47.784 --> 00:02:51.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How much we benefit from prayer

00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:54.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is closely related to the strength

00:02:54.023 --> 00:02:58.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:01.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A key factor in that relationship

00:03:01.664 --> 00:03:05.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is found at Psalm 37:3:

00:03:06.202 --> 00:03:09.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Trust in Jehovah and do what is good;

00:03:09.772 --> 00:03:13.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reside in the earth,
and act with faithfulness.”

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likely you’d agree that when we need
to talk to someone about our worries, 

00:03:18.948 --> 00:03:20.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we go to a trusted friend.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:25.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s because we’ve developed
a relationship with him.

00:03:25.855 --> 00:03:29.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows us and our situation,

00:03:29.092 --> 00:03:32.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we know we can count on him.

00:03:32.028 --> 00:03:34.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than ever,

00:03:34.097 --> 00:03:38.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need
a close personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:03:38.835 --> 00:03:43.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For that to be possible, we must be convinced

00:03:43.206 --> 00:03:48.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah knows
who we are and that he understands us

00:03:48.211 --> 00:03:51.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—our situation, our worries,

00:03:51.214 --> 00:03:54.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our concerns, and our needs.

00:03:54.951 --> 00:03:57.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what Jehovah promises

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in verses 4 and 5:

00:04:00.723 --> 00:04:03.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Find exquisite delight in Jehovah,

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he will grant you
the desires of your heart.

00:04:06.963 --> 00:04:09.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Commit your way to Jehovah;

00:04:09.198 --> 00:04:13.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rely on him, and he will act in your behalf.”

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah does know who we are.

00:04:17.073 --> 00:04:21.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He understands us better than anyone else,

00:04:21.044 --> 00:04:24.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even better than we understand ourselves.

00:04:24.747 --> 00:04:27.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He invites us to trust him,

00:04:27.817 --> 00:04:30.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he promises to act in our behalf.

00:04:30.987 --> 00:04:34.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The miracle of prayer lets us experience

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s love in a truly intimate way.

00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:43.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our Father personally
takes the time to listen to us;

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:46.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he has not delegated that to anyone else.

00:04:46.736 --> 00:04:49.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, you might be wondering,

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:54.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‛Why would the Creator
of the universe want to listen to me?’

00:04:54.944 --> 00:04:59.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The inspired answer at 1 Peter 5:7 says:

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Because he cares for you.”

00:05:02.986 --> 00:05:05.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your determination to keep doing

00:05:05.955 --> 00:05:08.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the best you can to serve him

00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:11.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in spite of all the problems you face

00:05:11.194 --> 00:05:13.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
endears you to him.

00:05:13.696 --> 00:05:18.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He feels for you and is eager to help.

00:05:18.301 --> 00:05:21.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does that make you feel?

00:05:21.004 --> 00:05:25.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Psalm 116:1, it says:

00:05:26.109 --> 00:05:28.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I love Jehovah

00:05:28.111 --> 00:05:30.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because he hears my voice,

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my pleas for help.”

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:36.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though we can’t see him listening to us,

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:38.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s as if we feel

00:05:38.321 --> 00:05:42.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s loving arms around us when we pray.

00:05:42.692 --> 00:05:46.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result, the more we pray,

00:05:46.162 --> 00:05:49.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more our love and trust in him grows.

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:51.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What else will help us

00:05:51.934 --> 00:05:55.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build our love
and trust in our God, Jehovah?

00:05:55.304 --> 00:05:59.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s more than recognizing
that he hears our prayers.

00:05:59.942 --> 00:06:01.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must be convinced

00:06:01.944 --> 00:06:05.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he answers our prayers.

00:06:05.248 --> 00:06:09.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What evidence do we have
that Jehovah answers prayers?

00:06:09.752 --> 00:06:13.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at some
specific answers to prayers,

00:06:13.056 --> 00:06:15.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both past and present.

00:06:15.691 --> 00:06:19.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open your Bible to 2 Chronicles chapter 20.

00:06:19.962 --> 00:06:24.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Judah was threatened
by the combined forces

00:06:24.167 --> 00:06:28.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Ammon and Moab
and the mountainous region of Seir,

00:06:28.938 --> 00:06:33.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King Jehoshaphat
humbly prayed for Jehovah’s help.

00:06:33.609 --> 00:06:36.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 12, he prayed:

00:06:37.513 --> 00:06:42.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“O our God,
will you not execute judgment on them?

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:44.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For we are powerless

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“before this large crowd
that is coming against us;

00:06:47.857 --> 00:06:50.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and we do not know what we should do,

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but our eyes are toward you.”

00:06:54.097 --> 00:06:56.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was Jehovah’s answer?

00:06:56.365 --> 00:06:59.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was no voice from heaven.

00:06:59.068 --> 00:07:02.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah caused a prophet to speak up.

00:07:02.305 --> 00:07:04.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 15 says:

00:07:05.308 --> 00:07:08.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Here is what Jehovah says to you,

00:07:08.111 --> 00:07:12.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Do not be afraid or be terrified
because of this large crowd,

00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:16.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the battle is not yours but God’s.’”

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:19.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then verse 17 continues:

00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:22.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You will not need to fight this battle.

00:07:22.425 --> 00:07:25.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Take your position, stand still,

00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:30.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see the salvation
of Jehovah in your behalf.”

00:07:30.032 --> 00:07:32.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you note the formula?

00:07:32.401 --> 00:07:36.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s dedicated servant
is facing a serious problem.

00:07:36.806 --> 00:07:40.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He prays specifically,

00:07:40.109 --> 00:07:44.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then he remains attentive to the answer.

00:07:44.614 --> 00:07:49.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer may have seemed
strange to Jehoshaphat.

00:07:49.619 --> 00:07:52.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah didn’t provide a battle plan.

00:07:52.955 --> 00:07:56.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As strategies go, just walking out

00:07:56.159 --> 00:07:59.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to meet the enemy
doesn’t sound like a very good one.

00:07:59.629 --> 00:08:02.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehoshaphat discerned

00:08:02.398 --> 00:08:04.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this was the answer from Jehovah,

00:08:04.834 --> 00:08:07.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he let it direct his actions.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What happened?

00:08:09.872 --> 00:08:12.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah fought for Judah

00:08:12.441 --> 00:08:16.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by striking confusion
into the ranks of the enemy

00:08:16.212 --> 00:08:18.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they slaughtered one another.

00:08:18.848 --> 00:08:21.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehoshaphat’s prayer was answered

00:08:21.784 --> 00:08:24.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a mighty way.

00:08:24.487 --> 00:08:27.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have examples in the first century

00:08:27.156 --> 00:08:30.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of collective prayers being answered.

00:08:30.359 --> 00:08:33.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One occasion was when King Herod

00:08:33.496 --> 00:08:36.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was out to gain the favor of the Jews,

00:08:36.666 --> 00:08:40.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so he had the apostle Peter imprisoned

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:42.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and placed under heavy guard.

00:08:42.672 --> 00:08:44.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would the congregation do?

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:48.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acts 12:5 gives us the answer:

00:08:49.512 --> 00:08:52.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So Peter was being kept in the prison,

00:08:52.515 --> 00:08:57.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the congregation
was intensely praying to God for him.”

00:08:57.386 --> 00:09:01.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did Jehovah answer their prayers
in behalf of Peter?

00:09:01.591 --> 00:09:06.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The account in verses 7-11 tells us 

00:09:06.262 --> 00:09:10.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that an angel of Jehovah
led Peter out of jail 

00:09:10.533 --> 00:09:13.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and delivered him to safety.

00:09:13.703 --> 00:09:18.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine how these events must have drawn

00:09:18.007 --> 00:09:21.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Christians in Jerusalem closer to Jehovah

00:09:21.277 --> 00:09:25.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they saw
that he had answered their prayers.

00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:28.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about today?

00:09:28.251 --> 00:09:32.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider the example
of our brothers in South Korea.

00:09:32.755 --> 00:09:37.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over the years,
more than 19,000 of our brothers

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been imprisoned
as conscientious objectors

00:09:41.597 --> 00:09:43.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to military service.

00:09:43.633 --> 00:09:47.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you personally pray
in behalf of these brothers

00:09:47.903 --> 00:09:50.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they might endure in their faith

00:09:50.539 --> 00:09:53.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or that they might be released from prison

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:55.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if it was Jehovah’s will?

00:09:55.945 --> 00:09:57.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re sure that you did.

00:09:57.947 --> 00:10:02.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, many of you prayed
for these brothers by name,

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:05.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as the congregation in the first century

00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:07.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prayed in behalf of Peter.

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With what result?

00:10:09.992 --> 00:10:14.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2018, a series
of court rulings in South Korea

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:18.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
finally recognized conscientious objection

00:10:18.301 --> 00:10:21.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to military service for religious reasons

00:10:21.837 --> 00:10:25.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a fundamental human right,

00:10:25.174 --> 00:10:28.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our brothers
were gradually released

00:10:28.778 --> 00:10:30.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from their prison bonds.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think?

00:10:32.782 --> 00:10:35.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did Jehovah hear our prayers

00:10:35.318 --> 00:10:37.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in behalf of these dear brothers?

00:10:37.953 --> 00:10:40.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a worldwide brotherhood,

00:10:40.856 --> 00:10:43.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there can be no doubt

00:10:43.025 --> 00:10:46.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our incessant prayers to Jehovah

00:10:46.095 --> 00:10:51.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were a major factor
in these marvelous developments,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we praise and thank Jehovah

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:57.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he’s heard our prayers.

00:10:57.573 --> 00:11:01.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does this review
of how Jehovah answered the prayers

00:11:01.143 --> 00:11:04.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of his servants
in the past and present do for us?

00:11:04.814 --> 00:11:08.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doesn’t it build confidence that Jehovah

00:11:08.284 --> 00:11:12.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is listening to and acting on
the prayers of his people?

00:11:12.555 --> 00:11:16.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle John had that confidence.

00:11:16.459 --> 00:11:20.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wrote at 1 John 5:14:

00:11:21.564 --> 00:11:25.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And this is the confidence
that we have toward him,

00:11:25.234 --> 00:11:28.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that no matter what we ask
according to his will,

00:11:28.904 --> 00:11:31.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he hears us.”

00:11:31.273 --> 00:11:33.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now the question is:

00:11:33.476 --> 00:11:36.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When was the last time
that Jehovah answered

00:11:36.479 --> 00:11:39.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one of your personal prayers?

00:11:39.248 --> 00:11:42.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We spend much time on learning

00:11:42.084 --> 00:11:45.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to pray and what to pray for,

00:11:45.354 --> 00:11:48.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but do we put forth enough effort

00:11:48.224 --> 00:11:52.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in identifying the answers to our prayers?

00:11:52.561 --> 00:11:56.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For us to have the closeness to Jehovah,

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:59.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we must be certain that he’s listening

00:11:59.301 --> 00:12:02.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and responding to our personal prayers.

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:06.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may not always be readily discernible

00:12:06.375 --> 00:12:09.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just how some prayers are answered.

00:12:09.311 --> 00:12:11.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what can we do?

00:12:11.647 --> 00:12:15.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take time to meditate on Jehovah’s response

00:12:15.418 --> 00:12:18.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to your prayerful requests.

00:12:18.087 --> 00:12:20.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re married,

00:12:20.089 --> 00:12:24.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
freely discuss matters
that you have prayed for in common

00:12:24.894 --> 00:12:28.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how Jehovah
may be answering those prayers.

00:12:28.531 --> 00:12:33.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be observant and alert to things
that are happening around you,

00:12:33.302 --> 00:12:36.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and learn to connect these things

00:12:36.372 --> 00:12:39.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the answers to your prayers.

00:12:39.141 --> 00:12:42.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make your prayers more specific,

00:12:42.111 --> 00:12:46.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’ll become
more keenly aware of Jehovah’s answers

00:12:46.382 --> 00:12:50.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even though they may be subtle.

00:12:50.319 --> 00:12:54.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Identifying your answered prayers

00:12:54.023 --> 00:12:58.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will make Jehovah more real to you.

00:12:58.127 --> 00:13:02.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This process
of identifying answers to our prayers

00:13:02.998 --> 00:13:07.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should be learned early on
in one’s spiritual development.

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:12.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We cannot take it
for granted that our children

00:13:12.308 --> 00:13:16.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or our Bible students
will connect the answers

00:13:16.178 --> 00:13:19.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they receive to the prayers they’ve offered.

00:13:19.348 --> 00:13:21.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One Witness said,

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:25.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I find that people feel closer to God

00:13:25.187 --> 00:13:27.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“if I help them to recognize

00:13:27.756 --> 00:13:30.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
answers to their prayers.”

00:13:30.593 --> 00:13:33.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if we can’t identify

00:13:33.395 --> 00:13:36.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the answer to one of our prayers?

00:13:36.665 --> 00:13:40.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does that mean
it wasn’t according to Jehovah’s will?

00:13:40.636 --> 00:13:43.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not necessarily.

00:13:43.005 --> 00:13:47.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are two important factors
that might be involved.

00:13:47.843 --> 00:13:50.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One is that Jehovah knows

00:13:50.846 --> 00:13:53.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the best time and way

00:13:53.949 --> 00:13:56.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to answer our prayers.

00:13:56.318 --> 00:14:00.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He takes all matters into consideration.

00:14:00.523 --> 00:14:02.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer may not come

00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:07.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to our timetable, but it will come.

00:14:07.029 --> 00:14:09.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we must be patient

00:14:09.832 --> 00:14:12.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and keep looking for the answer.

00:14:12.668 --> 00:14:16.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second factor that Jehovah considers

00:14:16.305 --> 00:14:19.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the issue raised by Satan

00:14:19.174 --> 00:14:21.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding man’s integrity.

00:14:21.877 --> 00:14:25.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen again to the challenge Satan makes

00:14:25.347 --> 00:14:29.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded at Job 1:10, 11:

00:14:31.253 --> 00:14:33.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Have you not put up a protective hedge

00:14:33.656 --> 00:14:37.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“around him and his house
and everything he has?

00:14:37.159 --> 00:14:39.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You have blessed the work of his hands,

00:14:39.795 --> 00:14:43.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and his livestock
has spread out in the land.

00:14:43.032 --> 00:14:46.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But, for a change, stretch out your hand

00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:48.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and strike everything he has,

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:52.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will surely
curse you to your very face.”

00:14:52.975 --> 00:14:55.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah permitted this issue

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:59.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be raised out of love
for his intelligent creatures.

00:14:59.114 --> 00:15:02.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He permitted Job to undergo a test

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:06.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Satan before the entire universe.

00:15:06.422 --> 00:15:10.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gives his creatures the privilege

00:15:10.292 --> 00:15:14.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of proving the Devil a liar
and of removing the slander

00:15:14.463 --> 00:15:16.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only from God’s name

00:15:16.732 --> 00:15:19.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also from their own.

00:15:19.535 --> 00:15:23.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah, seeing the entire issue,

00:15:23.539 --> 00:15:26.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may allow his servants to endure trials.

00:15:26.775 --> 00:15:29.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that doesn’t mean

00:15:29.144 --> 00:15:32.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s not answering
the prayer of the afflicted.

00:15:32.581 --> 00:15:37.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we are under trial,
we may have prayed for relief,

00:15:37.219 --> 00:15:40.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we may have also prayed:

00:15:40.122 --> 00:15:43.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let your name be sanctified.”

00:15:43.892 --> 00:15:47.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must remain convinced that Jehovah

00:15:47.129 --> 00:15:49.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will not simply answer a prayer;

00:15:49.665 --> 00:15:53.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will provide the best answer.

00:15:53.335 --> 00:15:58.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t it true that
when we maintain our integrity,

00:15:58.273 --> 00:16:01.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even through serious illness,

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:04.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it can be a tremendous witness to others?

00:16:04.747 --> 00:16:07.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the case with Jerod Septer.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Word says:

00:16:14.289 --> 00:16:16.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Remember, then, your Grand Creator

00:16:16.925 --> 00:16:18.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the days of your youth,

00:16:18.861 --> 00:16:22.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the days of distress come.”

00:16:22.631 --> 00:16:24.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And “the days of distress”

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they arrived early on Jerod at 11.

00:16:28.871 --> 00:16:32.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jerod was diagnosed
with lymphoma cancer in the middle of 1991.

00:16:34.209 --> 00:16:37.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We started trying
to figure out how we could get him

00:16:37.479 --> 00:16:40.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the treatment that he needed,
of course, but in no way would we accept

00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:43.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a blood transfusion, and neither would Jerod.

00:16:43.986 --> 00:16:48.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jerod was in the hospital,
Child Protective Services

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:49.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did investigate us.

00:16:49.825 --> 00:16:51.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were concerned there was negligence.

00:16:51.627 --> 00:16:54.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just adding to the pain.

00:16:54.229 --> 00:16:58.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The way it turned out,
they backed completely away from that.

00:16:58.434 --> 00:17:00.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They realized that we hadn’t been negligent.

00:17:00.469 --> 00:17:04.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as we faced different situations,
we’d pray at the time,

00:17:04.606 --> 00:17:07.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to have miraculous answers,

00:17:07.509 --> 00:17:12.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but for Jehovah to open our eyes
and to be able to find things.

00:17:12.114 --> 00:17:15.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it seemed as though
he was really directing us,

00:17:15.984 --> 00:17:18.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we could take care
of ourselves spiritually

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:23.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through this situation as well as take care
of Jerod’s medical needs.

00:17:23.625 --> 00:17:25.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember

00:17:25.961 --> 00:17:28.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many times falling on my knees

00:17:28.864 --> 00:17:31.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and praying and thinking: ‘This is it.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m tested beyond what I can bear.’

00:17:34.336 --> 00:17:36.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah would strengthen me.

00:17:36.972 --> 00:17:38.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And someone would come,

00:17:38.607 --> 00:17:41.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or they would say something.

00:17:41.643 --> 00:17:43.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they fed us.

00:17:43.545 --> 00:17:46.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brother made a schedule, and he said,

00:17:46.181 --> 00:17:48.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You’re going to feed these friends.”

00:17:48.617 --> 00:17:50.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the brother’s instructions were:

00:17:50.819 --> 00:17:52.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You don’t bring it
and just drop off the food.

00:17:52.855 --> 00:17:54.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You stay with those friends.”

00:17:54.923 --> 00:17:57.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It made me cry

00:17:57.693 --> 00:17:59.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the love and the care that we experienced.

00:17:59.962 --> 00:18:01.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One time, I remember

00:18:01.964 --> 00:18:03.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the hallways of this hospital

00:18:03.966 --> 00:18:06.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1,500 miles (2,400 km) away from our home—

00:18:06.902 --> 00:18:09.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
started filling up with people.

00:18:09.404 --> 00:18:11.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To me, that was answering prayers too.

00:18:13.275 --> 00:18:16.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was hard for us
to get out of the hospital,

00:18:16.278 --> 00:18:18.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they recorded talks.

00:18:18.113 --> 00:18:20.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would look us in the eye,
and they’d say:

00:18:20.582 --> 00:18:22.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now, you need to listen to this.

00:18:22.417 --> 00:18:24.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will keep you strong.”

00:18:25.521 --> 00:18:28.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jerod was worried about us,
and he made it clear

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he was going to be fine.

00:18:31.326 --> 00:18:33.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He just didn’t know if we were going to be.

00:18:33.996 --> 00:18:36.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He died

00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:40.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in June of 1992.

00:18:40.102 --> 00:18:42.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was at home.

00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:45.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the last thing he said to us was,

00:18:45.974 --> 00:18:50.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Work hard so we can all be together again.”

00:18:57.953 --> 00:18:59.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s numbing 

00:18:59.721 --> 00:19:03.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it’s almost like
you’re living a nightmare

00:19:03.025 --> 00:19:07.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you never think
that those things will happen to you,

00:19:10.532 --> 00:19:12.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it did.

00:19:12.534 --> 00:19:15.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want people to see me cry.

00:19:15.137 --> 00:19:19.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want pity, and I didn’t—

00:19:20.742 --> 00:19:22.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of that

00:19:22.744 --> 00:19:26.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—those negative feelings—
my imagination ran wild.

00:19:29.117 --> 00:19:31.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped me, I know,

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was Gary putting into my heart and mind

00:19:35.591 --> 00:19:37.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this is a fight.

00:19:37.693 --> 00:19:40.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been a challenge for all mankind.

00:19:40.395 --> 00:19:42.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If you make it hard on them,
they won’t love you’

00:19:42.764 --> 00:19:46.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Satan said that
about Jehovah and individuals.

00:19:46.235 --> 00:19:48.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I would be giving in to that.

00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:52.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The strong feelings I had

00:19:52.674 --> 00:19:56.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my sorrow almost made me stop.

00:19:56.144 --> 00:19:59.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed a lot
to go back to the Kingdom Hall.

00:19:59.615 --> 00:20:04.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The congregation cried;
they lost a little boy.

00:20:04.653 --> 00:20:06.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t just Gary and Beth.

00:20:06.088 --> 00:20:08.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They lost a little boy.

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:09.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They cried,

00:20:12.127 --> 00:20:15.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I didn’t feel alone.

00:20:15.097 --> 00:20:18.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we hugged; we cried together.

00:20:20.302 --> 00:20:23.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really benefited us to get right back

00:20:23.538 --> 00:20:26.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into spiritual focus
and to get our minds off ourselves.

00:20:26.842 --> 00:20:29.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I could’ve given in
to my pain and thought,

00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:31.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, I’m too heartbroken.’

00:20:31.513 --> 00:20:33.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It made me have more joy

00:20:33.548 --> 00:20:36.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I realized that now they have a hope.

00:20:37.653 --> 00:20:40.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People around us were vital

00:20:40.022 --> 00:20:42.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the support system Jehovah has—

00:20:42.057 --> 00:20:45.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his Word, his spirit.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah answered those prayers.

00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:50.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our goal was really to stay

00:20:50.132 --> 00:20:53.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the full-time ministry
(maybe doing something else),

00:20:53.702 --> 00:20:57.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we never, ever thought
we would be in the circuit work.

00:20:57.272 --> 00:21:01.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to have our daughter
working with her husband in the circuit work

00:21:01.443 --> 00:21:03.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it’s almost hard
to believe that it’s happening.

00:21:05.247 --> 00:21:08.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We look forward to seeing Jerod again,
having him back with us.

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:13.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I’m waiting,
and I know I’m not going to be disappointed.

00:21:13.855 --> 00:21:17.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How encouraging to know that Gary and Beth

00:21:17.092 --> 00:21:20.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are able to take vacation time
to travel occasionally

00:21:20.162 --> 00:21:23.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see their daughter and her husband,

00:21:23.031 --> 00:21:26.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are also serving in the traveling work.

00:21:26.468 --> 00:21:31.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And did you notice how Gary, Beth, and Jerod

00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:35.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
felt Jehovah’s loving support as they prayed

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:38.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
throughout this heart-wrenching trial?

00:21:38.146 --> 00:21:40.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They asked for wisdom

00:21:40.449 --> 00:21:43.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when seeking medical treatment for Jerod.

00:21:43.151 --> 00:21:47.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah put his arms around them and listened

00:21:47.222 --> 00:21:51.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they felt overwhelmed
with grief and negative feelings.

00:21:51.693 --> 00:21:55.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He strengthened
Jerod’s hope in the resurrection

00:21:55.731 --> 00:21:58.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helped Brother and Sister Septer

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stay spiritually strong.

00:22:00.969 --> 00:22:03.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can there be any doubt

00:22:03.472 --> 00:22:06.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah was answering their prayers?

00:22:06.641 --> 00:22:09.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doesn’t that strengthen our conviction

00:22:09.644 --> 00:22:13.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will also answer Jerod’s prayer

00:22:13.315 --> 00:22:16.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they all will be together again?

00:22:16.651 --> 00:22:21.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, Jehovah didn’t miraculously cure Jerod.

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:25.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But through his endurance and strong faith,

00:22:25.861 --> 00:22:29.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jerod gave a witness to the universe

00:22:29.164 --> 00:22:33.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that even a child that trusts in Jehovah

00:22:33.468 --> 00:22:36.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can prove his loyalty to death.

00:22:36.638 --> 00:22:39.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, other situations

00:22:39.875 --> 00:22:43.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may turn out differently
and not end up in death.

00:22:43.678 --> 00:22:47.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If an individual feels that relief

00:22:47.115 --> 00:22:50.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was because of Jehovah’s intervention,

00:22:50.252 --> 00:22:53.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he should certainly give thanks.

00:22:53.021 --> 00:22:57.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, we must recognize that Jehovah knows

00:22:57.092 --> 00:22:59.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the best way to handle matters

00:22:59.728 --> 00:23:03.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that it results in honor to his name

00:23:03.465 --> 00:23:07.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to the lasting good of his servants.

00:23:07.769 --> 00:23:11.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, it’s worth mentioning that the Bible

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
often connects
our remaining spiritually alert

00:23:15.277 --> 00:23:17.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with our need to pray.

00:23:17.612 --> 00:23:21.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 26:41,

00:23:21.183 --> 00:23:23.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said:

00:23:23.085 --> 00:23:27.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep on the watch and pray continually.”

00:23:27.355 --> 00:23:30.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 Peter 4:7,

00:23:30.425 --> 00:23:32.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter wrote:

00:23:33.261 --> 00:23:36.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the end of all things has drawn close.

00:23:36.765 --> 00:23:39.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore, be sound in mind,

00:23:39.501 --> 00:23:43.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be vigilant with a view to prayers.”

00:23:44.005 --> 00:23:47.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Indeed, our prayers are so important.

00:23:47.809 --> 00:23:50.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our personal prayers will help us

00:23:50.345 --> 00:23:55.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to remain spiritually alert
and active in God’s service

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:57.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we await the great tribulation

00:23:57.853 --> 00:24:00.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that lies just ahead of us.

00:24:00.889 --> 00:24:04.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in summary, our prayers to Jehovah

00:24:04.626 --> 00:24:08.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reveal the closeness
of our relationship with him

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:12.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the degree of our dependence upon him.

00:24:12.801 --> 00:24:15.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They show the trueness of our faith,

00:24:15.804 --> 00:24:18.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the depth of our devotion,

00:24:18.373 --> 00:24:22.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the genuineness of our appreciation.

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:26.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our prayers also help us
to remain spiritually alert

00:24:26.882 --> 00:24:29.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we endure these last days

00:24:29.584 --> 00:24:32.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the great tribulation.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll be drawn even closer to Jehovah

00:24:35.824 --> 00:24:40.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we learn to recognize
his answers to our prayers.
