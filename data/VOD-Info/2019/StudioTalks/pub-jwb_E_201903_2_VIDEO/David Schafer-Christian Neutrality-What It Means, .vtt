Our theme this month is

00:00:03.286 --> 00:00:05.288 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Christian Neutrality

00:00:05.288 --> 00:00:08.191 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“—What It Means, What It Takes,

00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:10.660 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and Why We Choose It.”

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is your opinion?

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:14.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where do you stand?

00:00:14.998 --> 00:00:19.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can one person
make a difference in countering injustice?

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we hear people
discussing political topics,

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we might at first think
their conversation is purely philosophical;

00:00:26.643 --> 00:00:29.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but when injustice threatens our loved ones,

00:00:29.713 --> 00:00:32.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it can seem personal.

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:36.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We expect that people
will be divided over political ideology.

00:00:36.886 --> 00:00:40.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation chapters 8-13
foretold that in the last days,

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
government would be
the burning issue among mankind

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:49.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that people
would feel pressured to take sides.

00:00:49.532 --> 00:00:52.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The question each of us
needs to ask himself is,

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:57.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do I respond when people
debate solutions to serious injustices?

00:00:58.808 --> 00:01:01.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Christians,
we’re most interested

00:01:01.911 --> 00:01:04.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the example of Christ.

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:08.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If ever there was a person who could make
a difference in countering injustice,

00:01:08.118 --> 00:01:10.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was Jesus.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He felt deep compassion for people.

00:01:13.056 --> 00:01:15.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with his abilities to feed the hungry,

00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:20.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
heal the sick, raise the dead,
and reach hearts with his winsome words,

00:01:20.764 --> 00:01:25.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus could have exerted
invincible influence in the realm of politics.

00:01:25.702 --> 00:01:28.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He certainly had the opportunity to do so.

00:01:28.638 --> 00:01:30.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan was pleased to offer him

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth”

00:01:32.642 --> 00:01:35.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in an exchange for one act of worship.

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:37.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jesus wouldn’t accept it.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neither did he assert that Satan
had no authority to make such an offer.

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:46.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, Jesus’ own countrymen
tried to make him king,

00:01:46.256 --> 00:01:48.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he rejected that too.

00:01:48.558 --> 00:01:51.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later still, someone asked him

00:01:51.094 --> 00:01:54.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether it was lawful
to pay taxes to the Roman government.

00:01:54.731 --> 00:01:58.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, Jesus didn’t take sides.

00:01:58.802 --> 00:02:01.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He refused to become a world ruler,

00:02:01.237 --> 00:02:04.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a national leader, or a political activist.

00:02:05.475 --> 00:02:10.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did that mean that Jesus didn’t care?
that he had no opinion?

00:02:10.013 --> 00:02:11.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To the contrary!

00:02:11.648 --> 00:02:14.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus cared more deeply than we can fathom.

00:02:14.584 --> 00:02:16.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And by treating people fairly,

00:02:16.586 --> 00:02:20.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus promoted justice
at the most fundamental level.

00:02:20.924 --> 00:02:23.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, his principal focus

00:02:23.827 --> 00:02:26.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was on teaching people
about the Kingdom of God,

00:02:26.462 --> 00:02:29.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which would eliminate injustice for all time.

00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:33.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what did Jesus
indicate should be our position

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:36.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding human governments?

00:02:36.172 --> 00:02:40.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learn from Jesus’ response
to the question about Roman taxation

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded at Mark 12:15-17:

00:02:46.983 --> 00:02:49.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Bring me a denarius to look at.’

00:02:49.686 --> 00:02:52.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They brought one, and he said to them:

00:02:52.622 --> 00:02:55.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Whose image and inscription is this?’

00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:57.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They said to him: ‘Caesar’s.’

00:02:57.627 --> 00:03:00.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jesus then said:

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:03.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Pay back Caesar’s things to Caesar,

00:03:03.132 --> 00:03:06.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but God’s things to God.’”

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:09.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are Caesar’s things?

00:03:09.672 --> 00:03:13.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Romans 13:1-7,

00:03:13.142 --> 00:03:16.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the apostle Paul lists tax, tribute,

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:19.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fear, and honor.

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:24.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice, too, that Jesus said
to “pay back Caesar’s things.”

00:03:24.654 --> 00:03:26.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that imply?

00:03:26.656 --> 00:03:29.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That Caesar, 
the ruling authority of the day,

00:03:29.058 --> 00:03:33.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had issued valuable things
—coins, for example.

00:03:33.062 --> 00:03:37.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thus, Caesar had the right
to ask for some of those coins back.

00:03:37.934 --> 00:03:42.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This enabled the State
to continue rendering necessary services.

00:03:42.005 --> 00:03:44.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus acknowledged that.

00:03:44.841 --> 00:03:46.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand,

00:03:46.843 --> 00:03:50.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our most valuable possessions
are grants from God himself

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—such gifts as our heart,
our life, our mind, and our strength.

00:03:55.385 --> 00:03:58.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can’t give those things back to Caesar

00:03:58.221 --> 00:04:01.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Caesar
didn’t grant them to us in the first place.

00:04:01.057 --> 00:04:04.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We rightly give those things back to God

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:07.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the form of our dedication and our love.

00:04:08.631 --> 00:04:13.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regarding our love for God,
Jesus said at Mark 12:30:

00:04:14.871 --> 00:04:17.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You must love Jehovah your God

00:04:17.874 --> 00:04:21.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with your whole heart
and with your whole soul

00:04:21.644 --> 00:04:24.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and with your whole mind

00:04:24.013 --> 00:04:27.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with your whole strength.”

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:31.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the love we give back to God is total

00:04:31.254 --> 00:04:33.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no bodily part, function,

00:04:33.556 --> 00:04:36.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
capacity, or desire being left out.

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:41.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who love God take the side of Jesus,

00:04:41.798 --> 00:04:45.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whom Jehovah has appointed as King.

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:50.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how would Jesus’ disciples
defend his Kingdom when people opposed it?

00:04:50.873 --> 00:04:53.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We gain insight from events that occurred

00:04:53.609 --> 00:04:56.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the last night of Jesus’ life on earth.

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:59.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recall from Matthew chapter 26

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:03.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that when “a large crowd
with swords and clubs” came to arrest Jesus,

00:05:03.786 --> 00:05:08.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter “drew his sword and struck
the slave of the high priest, taking off his ear.”

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:13.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John reports that the slave’s name was Malchus.

00:05:13.296 --> 00:05:17.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Luke adds that Jesus touched
the man’s ear and healed him.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine that!

00:05:19.302 --> 00:05:23.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus bore no ill will
toward the men taking him into custody.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Further, according to Matthew 26:52,

00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:29.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus told Peter:

00:05:29.212 --> 00:05:32.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Return your sword to its place,

00:05:32.382 --> 00:05:34.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for all those who take up the sword

00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:38.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will perish by the sword.”

00:05:38.521 --> 00:05:42.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did Jesus disapprove of Peter’s brave act?

00:05:42.225 --> 00:05:46.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the same reason that he had avoided
the political process all the way up to that point.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus explained this when he appeared
before Pontius Pilate later that night.

00:05:52.835 --> 00:05:57.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At John 18:36, we read:

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My Kingdom is no part of this world.”

00:06:03.046 --> 00:06:06.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, because Jesus’ Kingdom
is not of human origin,

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:09.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it doesn’t need human defenses.

00:06:09.952 --> 00:06:13.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we be sure
that this is what Jesus meant?

00:06:13.423 --> 00:06:17.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look closely at the rest of John 18:36:

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If my Kingdom were part of this world,

00:06:21.197 --> 00:06:23.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“my attendants would have fought

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:25.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that I should not be handed over to the Jews.

00:06:25.668 --> 00:06:27.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But as it is,

00:06:27.236 --> 00:06:32.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my Kingdom is not from this source.”

00:06:32.108 --> 00:06:34.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as Christians,

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what is our position
where political matters are concerned?

00:06:38.548 --> 00:06:40.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are neutral.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes people
misunderstand this viewpoint.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some have concluded that because we
don’t promote one human government,

00:06:48.524 --> 00:06:51.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we must be promoting
another human government.

00:06:51.761 --> 00:06:55.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the 1950’s,
in what is now the Republic of Congo,

00:06:55.431 --> 00:06:59.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
authorities falsely accused
Jehovah’s Witnesses of being Communists.

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:01.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But during the 1970’s,

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:04.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Congo adopted
a Communist form of government,

00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:09.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the new authorities found fault
with us for not being Communists!

00:07:09.178 --> 00:07:11.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, however, and for nearly three decades,

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:16.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses have enjoyed
legal status in the Republic of Congo.

00:07:16.085 --> 00:07:18.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And whereas some have perceived

00:07:18.488 --> 00:07:21.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our Christian neutrality as sheer apathy,

00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:25.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
others construe our position as a threat.

00:07:25.495 --> 00:07:28.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s address both of these viewpoints.

00:07:28.631 --> 00:07:31.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, there is a big difference

00:07:31.234 --> 00:07:34.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between Christian neutrality and apathy.

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Apathy is defined

00:07:36.472 --> 00:07:40.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “a lack of interest, enthusiasm, or concern.”

00:07:40.109 --> 00:07:42.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We certainly don’t lack interest in people,

00:07:42.378 --> 00:07:44.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor are we insensitive to their feelings.

00:07:44.814 --> 00:07:48.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Jesus,
we strive to alleviate people’s suffering

00:07:48.084 --> 00:07:50.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by helping them in practical ways

00:07:50.253 --> 00:07:53.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while teaching them about the only Kingdom

00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:55.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can eliminate injustice.

00:07:55.324 --> 00:07:57.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By teaching people from God’s Word,

00:07:57.827 --> 00:07:59.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we endeavor to change hearts,

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:02.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not political institutions.

00:08:02.098 --> 00:08:04.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We feel this approach is realistic

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because mankind’s main problems
are not political

00:08:08.471 --> 00:08:11.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but moral.

00:08:11.174 --> 00:08:14.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why can it be said
that Jehovah’s Witnesses are not a threat

00:08:14.977 --> 00:08:17.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, rather, an asset?

00:08:17.146 --> 00:08:20.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We conscientiously obey the laws,

00:08:20.082 --> 00:08:22.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we support our communities
through volunteer service

00:08:22.985 --> 00:08:26.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or compulsory civilian service where that exists,

00:08:26.722 --> 00:08:28.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we pay our taxes.

00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:33.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true, we don’t vote
for political parties or candidates,

00:08:33.129 --> 00:08:35.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but neither do we disrupt elections

00:08:35.198 --> 00:08:37.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or interfere with those who choose to vote.

00:08:37.667 --> 00:08:41.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true, we don’t lobby,
campaign, or run for government office,

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:44.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but neither do we criticize those in power,

00:08:44.507 --> 00:08:48.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
undermine their policies,
or demonstrate for political change.

00:08:48.978 --> 00:08:51.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true, we won’t salute a flag,

00:08:51.547 --> 00:08:54.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but neither will we burn a flag, spit on a flag,

00:08:54.417 --> 00:08:57.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or disparage the nation that a flag represents

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even in lands where these are considered

00:09:00.122 --> 00:09:03.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
protected expressions of freedom.

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:06.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true,
we don’t sing national anthems,

00:09:06.596 --> 00:09:09.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but neither do we discourage
others from singing,

00:09:09.098 --> 00:09:12.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor do we make
a public spectacle of not singing;

00:09:12.168 --> 00:09:15.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we simply don’t participate.

00:09:15.538 --> 00:09:18.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true, we wouldn’t kill people in war,

00:09:18.207 --> 00:09:21.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but neither would we attack people at home.

00:09:21.143 --> 00:09:24.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So while we don’t promote any political position,

00:09:24.313 --> 00:09:28.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
neither do we condemn any political position
—even in our heart.

00:09:28.584 --> 00:09:32.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is what neutrality means.

00:09:32.688 --> 00:09:35.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t take sides.

00:09:35.358 --> 00:09:38.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if the demands of the State

00:09:38.861 --> 00:09:42.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
conflict with the commands of Jesus?

00:09:42.598 --> 00:09:45.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a Bible principle for that.

00:09:45.301 --> 00:09:50.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you thinking 
of what it says at Acts 5:28, 29

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:54.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that “we must obey God
as ruler rather than men”?

00:09:54.477 --> 00:09:57.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is not disregard for the State,

00:09:57.413 --> 00:10:00.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, rather, reverence for God.

00:10:00.182 --> 00:10:03.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the State demands
that we do what God forbids

00:10:03.753 --> 00:10:06.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or refrain from doing what God commands,

00:10:06.789 --> 00:10:10.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we believe God
would consider that an invalid request.

00:10:12.228 --> 00:10:14.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, one might say,

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:19.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I can imagine some situations
where that viewpoint could get you into trouble.’

00:10:19.835 --> 00:10:23.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus foretold as much at Matthew 24:9,

00:10:23.739 --> 00:10:27.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he said:
“You will be hated by all the nations

00:10:27.843 --> 00:10:30.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on account of my name.”

00:10:30.179 --> 00:10:33.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More specifically, at Revelation 2:10,

00:10:33.082 --> 00:10:37.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said that some of his disciples
would be thrown into prison

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not all of us but some.

00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:44.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re not disappointed
if we don’t get thrown into prison,

00:10:44.126 --> 00:10:47.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but neither are we discouraged if we do.

00:10:47.396 --> 00:10:50.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our minds turn
to the thousands of brothers and sisters

00:10:50.933 --> 00:10:52.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have been sentenced
to prison over the years

00:10:52.935 --> 00:10:55.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for their Christian neutrality.

00:10:55.404 --> 00:10:57.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are proud of them.

00:10:57.406 --> 00:10:58.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We pray for them.

00:10:58.708 --> 00:11:01.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that Jehovah is pleased with them.

00:11:02.611 --> 00:11:07.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their endurance under trial
spells victory for all of us.

00:11:07.016 --> 00:11:09.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?

00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:12.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To the congregation in Ephesus, Paul wrote:

00:11:14.156 --> 00:11:18.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I ask you not to give up
on account of my tribulations in your behalf,

00:11:18.994 --> 00:11:23.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for these mean glory for you.”

00:11:23.532 --> 00:11:28.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul wrote these words while he himself
was under house arrest in Rome.

00:11:28.304 --> 00:11:31.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In what sense did Paul’s tribulations

00:11:31.374 --> 00:11:34.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“mean glory” for the Ephesians?

00:11:34.276 --> 00:11:37.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In that his perseverance
in ministering despite trials

00:11:37.913 --> 00:11:41.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showed the congregation
that the privileges they enjoyed as Christians

00:11:41.584 --> 00:11:43.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were of the highest importance.

00:11:43.853 --> 00:11:48.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Paul had just given up,
what would that have implied?

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:50.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That their faith, their ministry,

00:11:50.559 --> 00:11:54.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their hope in God’s Kingdom
were not so valuable after all.

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:58.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead,
Paul’s endurance exalted Christianity.

00:11:58.167 --> 00:12:03.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It demonstrated
that remaining faithful is worth any sacrifice.

00:12:03.172 --> 00:12:07.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In like manner, the endurance
of our dear brothers and sisters in prison

00:12:07.476 --> 00:12:10.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
proves that their hope is alive

00:12:10.079 --> 00:12:13.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that the Kingdom they represent is real.

00:12:13.749 --> 00:12:17.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have an identity as envoys,

00:12:17.586 --> 00:12:19.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not of any human government,

00:12:19.422 --> 00:12:21.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but of the heavenly Kingdom

00:12:21.457 --> 00:12:25.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a Kingdom
that will reward them with everlasting life

00:12:25.261 --> 00:12:28.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a world without war.
