The theme of this program

00:00:02.485 --> 00:00:04.454 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is taken from the second part

00:00:04.454 --> 00:00:06.489 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of Romans 12:10:

00:00:06.489 --> 00:00:08.591 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“In showing honor to one another,

00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:10.727 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
take the lead.”

00:00:10.727 --> 00:00:12.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is honor?

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:15.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Hebrew Scriptures,
the term translated “honor”

00:00:15.965 --> 00:00:18.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
literally means “heaviness.”

00:00:18.735 --> 00:00:20.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we honor someone,

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re acknowledging that he’s weighty

00:00:22.972 --> 00:00:25.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or that he amounts to something.

00:00:25.375 --> 00:00:27.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Greek Scriptures,
the word is related

00:00:27.844 --> 00:00:30.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to setting a price on something,

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meaning that the one we honor
is esteemed or has value.

00:00:35.185 --> 00:00:37.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whom should we honor?

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:41.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, Jehovah is worthy of honor.

00:00:41.057 --> 00:00:44.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation 4:11 says this

00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:49.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gives us the reason
for giving glory and honor to Jehovah.

00:00:49.632 --> 00:00:53.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says because he “created all things.”

00:00:53.937 --> 00:00:58.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is responsible
for us having life in the first place.

00:00:59.743 --> 00:01:01.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we give him honor?

00:01:01.778 --> 00:01:03.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many ways:

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We honor him by doing his will

00:01:06.116 --> 00:01:08.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—obeying his laws and principles.

00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:12.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We honor him
by extolling his qualities and promises

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:16.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—telling others
about these gifts from God.

00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:19.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We show him honor
by contributing financially

00:01:19.262 --> 00:01:21.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the worldwide educational work

00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:26.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he’s directing
through his Son and holy spirit.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just as Revelation chapter 4 said

00:01:29.973 --> 00:01:33.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Jehovah being worthy of the honor,

00:01:33.243 --> 00:01:36.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation 5:12

00:01:36.312 --> 00:01:38.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says that his Son, Christ Jesus,

00:01:38.715 --> 00:01:41.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is worthy of the same.

00:01:41.885 --> 00:01:44.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 12 says of Jesus:

00:01:44.087 --> 00:01:46.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They were saying with a loud voice:

00:01:46.322 --> 00:01:48.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The Lamb who was slaughtered

00:01:48.324 --> 00:01:52.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘is worthy to receive
the power and riches and wisdom

00:01:52.162 --> 00:01:56.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and strength and honor
and glory and blessing.’”

00:01:56.933 --> 00:01:59.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we show honor to Jesus?

00:01:59.936 --> 00:02:03.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One way is acknowledged
in the verse we just read.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was “slaughtered”
like a sacrificial lamb

00:02:06.142 --> 00:02:09.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we might have the hope
of everlasting life.

00:02:09.746 --> 00:02:13.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We highly esteem,
and value, that sacrifice.

00:02:13.316 --> 00:02:16.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We honor Jesus
by recognizing his role

00:02:16.352 --> 00:02:19.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as an immortal
“King of kings” in the heavens.

00:02:19.422 --> 00:02:22.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And another
very practical way to honor Jesus

00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:26.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to strive to imitate
his life and personality

00:02:26.362 --> 00:02:29.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the model for us to follow closely.

00:02:29.933 --> 00:02:32.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we take the lead in showing honor,

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who else will we view
as highly valued

00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:38.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to be treated with esteem?

00:02:38.174 --> 00:02:41.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ephesians 6:1, 2 says

00:02:41.377 --> 00:02:45.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that children ‘honor their father and mother’
when they’re obedient to them.

00:02:45.315 --> 00:02:48.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 15:4-6

00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:50.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
makes it clear that adult children

00:02:50.787 --> 00:02:52.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
honor their parents and grandparents

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:57.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by giving material assistance
to them as needed.

00:02:57.627 --> 00:03:00.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Timothy 5:17

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:03.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
urges us to give elders “double honor”

00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:05.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of their hard work in our behalf.

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:08.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 13:1, 7

00:03:08.671 --> 00:03:10.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even extends
the matter of showing honor

00:03:10.874 --> 00:03:15.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to governmental rulers
and others in authority.

00:03:15.645 --> 00:03:18.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 2:17

00:03:18.414 --> 00:03:21.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
broadens the meaning
of honor even further saying:

00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:24.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Honor men of all sorts.”

00:03:24.687 --> 00:03:29.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition to being kind
and respectful to people in general,

00:03:29.192 --> 00:03:31.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we also honor them
by being willing

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:35.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to spend time
sharing the good news with them.

00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:38.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ephesians 5:22-25

00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:41.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
appeals to wives
to honor their husbands

00:03:41.604 --> 00:03:44.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by having Christlike subjection for them.

00:03:44.841 --> 00:03:48.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Husbands are to honor their wives
by showing them love

00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:53.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and treating them
just as Jesus treated the congregation.

00:03:53.516 --> 00:03:57.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about our theme text
for this discussion?

00:03:57.387 --> 00:04:01.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who was Paul addressing
in Romans chapter 12 when he said:

00:04:01.791 --> 00:04:05.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In showing honor to one another,
take the lead”?

00:04:05.695 --> 00:04:10.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who are
the “one another” in that verse?

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:14.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at Romans 1:7 with me.

00:04:15.571 --> 00:04:19.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul says he’s writing
“to all those who are in Rome

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:23.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as God’s beloved ones,
called to be holy ones.”

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So all of us
in the Christian congregation

00:04:26.883 --> 00:04:29.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are to have honor for each other.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to spend
the balance of my time

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
discussing two
of the many opportunities

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:38.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to show honor

00:04:38.895 --> 00:04:42.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(they’re the last two
that I just referenced):

00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:46.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
first, marriage mates
showing honor to each other,

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:50.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and second, showing honor
to one another in our congregations.

00:04:51.908 --> 00:04:56.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Marriages in general today
are seriously lacking in honor.

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:59.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Marriage mates
often demean one another

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:03.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with harsh words
and disrespectful attitudes.

00:05:03.953 --> 00:05:06.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some in the world resort
to physical violence,

00:05:06.923 --> 00:05:09.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as if that somehow
makes the abusive one right

00:05:09.926 --> 00:05:12.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his view of whatever the issue is.

00:05:12.528 --> 00:05:17.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And infidelity on the part
of one or both mates is so common

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it doesn’t even
raise eyebrows anymore.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of this is a gross
lack of honor in marriage.

00:05:26.642 --> 00:05:28.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about marriages

00:05:28.644 --> 00:05:32.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those professing
to be Jehovah’s Witnesses?

00:05:32.315 --> 00:05:34.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re blessed
with so many marriages

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are wholesome and honorable.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True, none are perfect.

00:05:41.057 --> 00:05:43.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how blessed we are
to have the truth

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to have learned to be
more and more Christlike with each other.

00:05:48.031 --> 00:05:51.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve learned to shed things
that we heard when we were growing up.

00:05:52.869 --> 00:05:56.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the matter
of honoring our marriage mate

00:05:56.873 --> 00:05:59.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
needs to be discussed.

00:05:59.042 --> 00:06:01.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While relatively few of our marriages

00:06:01.844 --> 00:06:04.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
end up with some kind
of physical violence

00:06:04.113 --> 00:06:07.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and relatively few
end up in divorce,

00:06:07.583 --> 00:06:12.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what about having honor
in the marriage?

00:06:12.221 --> 00:06:14.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After living together
as husband and wife

00:06:14.757 --> 00:06:18.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for many months
or for years or even for decades,

00:06:18.327 --> 00:06:20.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
familiarity can cause us

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:23.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to treat each other
with less respect or honor

00:06:23.766 --> 00:06:25.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than when we were courting.

00:06:25.935 --> 00:06:28.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That isn’t right.

00:06:28.037 --> 00:06:31.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It isn’t Christlike.

00:06:31.441 --> 00:06:34.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with our inherited imperfection,

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may succumb
to dishonorable words and behavior

00:06:37.447 --> 00:06:39.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the one
that we promised to treasure

00:06:39.782 --> 00:06:43.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“until death do us part.”

00:06:43.152 --> 00:06:47.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we get a grip
on this trait and minimize the times

00:06:47.223 --> 00:06:51.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have
a clash of spirit and words?

00:06:51.627 --> 00:06:54.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, let’s consider

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the two basic responsibilities
assigned to marriage mates.

00:06:58.534 --> 00:07:00.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the foundation

00:07:00.536 --> 00:07:05.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can then build on to improve.

00:07:05.108 --> 00:07:08.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The role of the husband
is clearly stated

00:07:08.311 --> 00:07:11.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Corinthians 11:3.

00:07:11.747 --> 00:07:16.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And while some wives in society
may bristle at this thought,

00:07:16.285 --> 00:07:20.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wives serving Jehovah
are to embrace this thought.

00:07:20.456 --> 00:07:23.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the arrangement of God.

00:07:23.893 --> 00:07:27.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians 11:3 says:

00:07:27.463 --> 00:07:31.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But I want you to know
that the head of every man is the Christ;

00:07:31.467 --> 00:07:34.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in turn, the head
of a woman is the man;

00:07:34.103 --> 00:07:37.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in turn, the head of the Christ is God.”

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Word says
that “the head of a woman is the man.”

00:07:42.578 --> 00:07:45.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the head of the woman

00:07:45.414 --> 00:07:47.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not to be a domineering man,

00:07:47.984 --> 00:07:52.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not an abusive man
—verbally or physically.

00:07:52.021 --> 00:07:54.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is to imitate his head.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And who is that?

00:07:56.325 --> 00:07:58.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did the first part
of the verse say?

00:07:58.661 --> 00:08:02.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The head
of every man is the Christ.”

00:08:02.999 --> 00:08:06.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, Ephesians chapter 5

00:08:06.369 --> 00:08:10.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
strikes this fine balance
between being a head of the wife

00:08:10.406 --> 00:08:13.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and being
a loving head like the Christ.

00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:17.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ephesians 5:22, 23 says:

00:08:17.313 --> 00:08:22.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let wives be in subjection
to their husbands as to the Lord,

00:08:22.118 --> 00:08:25.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[But what of the disposition
of the husband?]

00:08:25.087 --> 00:08:28.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because a husband
is head of his wife

00:08:28.057 --> 00:08:31.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“just as the Christ
is head of the congregation,

00:08:31.627 --> 00:08:34.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he being a savior of this body.”

00:08:35.331 --> 00:08:39.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That verse says it all.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:43.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 33 of the same chapter says this:

00:08:43.472 --> 00:08:48.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Each one of you
must love his wife as he does himself;

00:08:48.144 --> 00:08:50.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on the other hand,

00:08:50.146 --> 00:08:55.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the wife should have
deep respect for her husband.”

00:08:55.451 --> 00:08:58.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s nowhere in God’s Word

00:08:58.054 --> 00:09:02.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that says that if one mate
pushes the other mate’s button

00:09:02.058 --> 00:09:04.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—emotionally—
that it cancels

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:08.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the offended mate’s obligation
to be Christlike.

00:09:08.331 --> 00:09:12.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The problem is that
when one mate is offended or hurt,

00:09:12.702 --> 00:09:17.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s so easy to roll the eyes in disgust

00:09:17.173 --> 00:09:20.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to lash back with a verbal insult.

00:09:20.743 --> 00:09:25.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then the other mate fires back
with another harsh, cutting remark.

00:09:25.114 --> 00:09:28.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like wind on a forest fire.

00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:32.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tempers blaze,
and the evening goes up in smoke.

00:09:32.755 --> 00:09:35.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not at all Christlike.

00:09:35.558 --> 00:09:40.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no honor shown
in such a conflagration.

00:09:40.229 --> 00:09:44.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has to stop sooner rather than later.

00:09:46.636 --> 00:09:51.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The January 15, 2015,
issue of The Watchtower said this:

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:56.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Remember that marriage
is not a competition

00:09:56.212 --> 00:09:59.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to find out who is stronger,
who can shout louder,

00:09:59.615 --> 00:10:02.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or who can think
of the most cutting remark.

00:10:02.585 --> 00:10:07.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“True, we all have flaws,
and sometimes we upset others.

00:10:07.189 --> 00:10:10.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But there is never a justifiable reason

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for either a husband or a wife

00:10:13.162 --> 00:10:16.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to use sarcastic and demeaning speech,

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:21.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or worse, to shove or hit each other.”

00:10:21.237 --> 00:10:24.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we change the atmosphere?

00:10:24.473 --> 00:10:27.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Someone needs to put out the fire

00:10:27.176 --> 00:10:30.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the water of God’s Word.

00:10:30.946 --> 00:10:34.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 12:10b, again:

00:10:34.083 --> 00:10:38.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In showing honor
to one another, take the lead.”

00:10:39.955 --> 00:10:42.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the mates must take the lead

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:46.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if at the time
they’re apologizing for their own behavior

00:10:46.462 --> 00:10:50.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by acknowledging that they
didn’t respond in a Christlike way saying,

00:10:50.966 --> 00:10:53.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Forgive me.”

00:10:54.303 --> 00:10:58.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That same issue
of The Watchtower cited two scriptures:

00:10:58.541 --> 00:11:01.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one for the husband
and one for the wife.

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:06.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll first read Proverbs 17:27.

00:11:07.516 --> 00:11:10.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Husbands, listen to this

00:11:10.186 --> 00:11:12.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and apply it prior to a rift

00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:15.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even during the conflict.

00:11:15.691 --> 00:11:18.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 17:27:

00:11:18.294 --> 00:11:22.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A man of knowledge
restrains his words,

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:26.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a discerning man will remain calm.”

00:11:26.569 --> 00:11:30.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Husbands, does that describe us?

00:11:32.174 --> 00:11:34.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now wives,

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:38.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please locate Proverbs 31:26.

00:11:40.449 --> 00:11:45.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does this describe your speech
even when some altercation occurs?

00:11:45.921 --> 00:11:48.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 31:26:

00:11:48.324 --> 00:11:50.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“She opens her mouth in wisdom;

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:54.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the law of kindness is on her tongue.”

00:11:54.797 --> 00:11:59.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Usually after a misunderstanding
and rash words have been said,

00:11:59.335 --> 00:12:02.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we feel miserable and upset.

00:12:02.304 --> 00:12:07.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We often chastise ourselves
for adding fuel to the fire.

00:12:07.042 --> 00:12:11.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How much better
to train ourselves to restrain our words

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and remain calm and to speak

00:12:13.682 --> 00:12:17.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in wisdom and with kindness of tongue.

00:12:18.554 --> 00:12:22.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meet Emil and Firuca Gârbovan
from Romania.

00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:26.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re good examples
of how the power of God’s Word

00:12:26.262 --> 00:12:29.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can mold and change
the attitudes of marriage mates

00:12:29.398 --> 00:12:32.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are willing to be guided by it.

00:12:34.737 --> 00:12:39.108 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It was in 1983 when I met Firuca.

00:12:40.476 --> 00:12:43.145 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I already had two little girls.

00:12:43.145 --> 00:12:45.147 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
One was seven years old,

00:12:45.147 --> 00:12:47.149 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the other one was three.

00:12:47.149 --> 00:12:49.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I accepted to study the Bible.

00:12:49.385 --> 00:12:51.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband worked

00:12:51.153 --> 00:12:53.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a warrant officer for the police,

00:12:53.289 --> 00:12:56.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so at the beginning,
I studied in secret.

00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:59.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I decided to tell him the truth.

00:12:59.895 --> 00:13:02.198 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When I found out

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:04.834 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that my wife was studying the Bible

00:13:04.834 --> 00:13:05.968 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in order to become

00:13:05.968 --> 00:13:07.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:10.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I became very sad.

00:13:10.105 --> 00:13:12.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I realized that our marriage

00:13:12.708 --> 00:13:15.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our family was in danger

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:17.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I only knew bad things

00:13:17.346 --> 00:13:19.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:13:22.051 --> 00:13:26.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He threatened
he would divorce me, and he did.

00:13:27.857 --> 00:13:31.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The divorce was
a very difficult time in my life

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:35.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I was seven months pregnant
with our third daughter.

00:13:36.699 --> 00:13:41.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Following the divorce, my husband
was given the house and custody

00:13:41.604 --> 00:13:43.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our two daughters.

00:13:43.939 --> 00:13:46.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to leave the house,

00:13:46.575 --> 00:13:51.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I stayed for almost a year
with two families of our brothers.

00:13:54.216 --> 00:13:57.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw Jehovah’s love toward me,

00:13:57.253 --> 00:14:00.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I loved Jehovah very much,

00:14:00.155 --> 00:14:04.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I loved my husband too.

00:14:05.828 --> 00:14:08.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, as I was walking

00:14:08.497 --> 00:14:11.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and holding the little girl’s hand,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw Firuca’s husband walking toward me.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My heart stopped,

00:14:16.872 --> 00:14:19.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I said to myself,

00:14:19.375 --> 00:14:21.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He is going to hit me!’

00:14:21.877 --> 00:14:24.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Emil was a gentleman.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he took the little girl in his arms,

00:14:27.783 --> 00:14:30.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
talked to her for a few minutes,

00:14:30.419 --> 00:14:34.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then he put her back down and left.

00:14:34.523 --> 00:14:38.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I saw him leaving, I thanked Jehovah

00:14:38.594 --> 00:14:41.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he didn’t beat me.

00:14:42.231 --> 00:14:45.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1990, I looked for my wife

00:14:45.901 --> 00:14:49.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I told her
that I would like to remarry her

00:14:49.071 --> 00:14:51.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reunite our family.

00:14:52.207 --> 00:14:54.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, after a while, she agreed

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:58.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and step-by-step I started to study.

00:14:58.881 --> 00:15:01.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2003, I became

00:15:01.617 --> 00:15:04.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:15:04.053 --> 00:15:07.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am very happy that I made this change,

00:15:07.222 --> 00:15:10.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I regret that I didn’t do it sooner.

00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:15.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I personally saw

00:15:15.497 --> 00:15:18.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how the truth can change a person’s life,

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even in my own family.

00:15:22.271 --> 00:15:24.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Currently, I serve as an elder.

00:15:24.873 --> 00:15:28.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in 2010, I became a regular pioneer.

00:15:28.777 --> 00:15:31.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I see Emil conduct

00:15:31.614 --> 00:15:34.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible study next to me,

00:15:34.683 --> 00:15:38.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel like kneeling rather than standing

00:15:38.487 --> 00:15:41.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to thank Jehovah.

00:15:42.925 --> 00:15:47.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So to married couples
who love Jehovah we repeat:

00:15:47.329 --> 00:15:50.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In showing honor . . . , take the lead.”

00:15:50.899 --> 00:15:54.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The principles just discussed
can also be applied

00:15:54.036 --> 00:15:57.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when showing honor
to others in the congregation.

00:15:57.373 --> 00:16:00.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like the husband and wife
that we just discussed,

00:16:00.442 --> 00:16:04.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of us should be improving
in imitating Jesus

00:16:04.446 --> 00:16:08.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in ‘following his steps closely’
in all of our interactions

00:16:08.017 --> 00:16:10.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with fellow believers
in the congregation.

00:16:11.887 --> 00:16:14.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we show honor
to one another?

00:16:14.423 --> 00:16:16.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One way is well described

00:16:16.492 --> 00:16:20.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Corinthians 10:23, 24.

00:16:20.996 --> 00:16:24.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We show honor
when we put the other person’s feelings

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and needs ahead of our own.

00:16:27.469 --> 00:16:31.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians 10:23, 24:

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All things are lawful,

00:16:33.909 --> 00:16:36.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but not all things are advantageous.

00:16:36.445 --> 00:16:40.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All things are lawful,
but not all things build up.

00:16:40.049 --> 00:16:44.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let each one keep seeking,
not his own advantage,

00:16:44.386 --> 00:16:47.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that of the other person.”

00:16:47.556 --> 00:16:51.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We show honor
when we suppress our own rights.

00:16:51.393 --> 00:16:56.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we do or say might be lawful,
but is it advantageous?

00:16:56.298 --> 00:16:58.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will it build up?

00:16:58.801 --> 00:17:01.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 24, then, concisely says it:

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:05.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep seeking,
not [our] own advantage [or right],

00:17:05.841 --> 00:17:08.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that of the other person.”

00:17:09.411 --> 00:17:13.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We show honor to others
when we do good deeds for them.

00:17:13.248 --> 00:17:16.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Possibly, it’s even a humble task

00:17:16.351 --> 00:17:18.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that an elderly publisher needs done.

00:17:18.987 --> 00:17:21.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could be offering to clean the house,

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:23.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take them to the store,
or fill some other need.

00:17:25.194 --> 00:17:28.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The principle is at Luke 22:26:

00:17:28.564 --> 00:17:31.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You, though,
are not to be that way.

00:17:31.366 --> 00:17:33.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But let the one
who is the greatest among you

00:17:33.869 --> 00:17:35.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“become as the youngest,

00:17:35.871 --> 00:17:39.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the one taking the lead
as the one ministering.”

00:17:40.275 --> 00:17:44.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Earlier, I cited 1 Timothy 5:17,

00:17:44.146 --> 00:17:47.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we’re urged
to give elders “double honor”

00:17:47.182 --> 00:17:49.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of their hard work in our behalf.

00:17:49.818 --> 00:17:53.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re also part
of our congregation and deserve honor.

00:17:54.556 --> 00:17:56.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our August program last year,

00:17:56.792 --> 00:18:00.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Lett helped us consider
much of what is involved.

00:18:00.395 --> 00:18:03.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll recall that his subject was

00:18:03.232 --> 00:18:06.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Appreciating Our ‘Gifts in Men.’”

00:18:06.802 --> 00:18:09.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We minister to or honor others

00:18:09.705 --> 00:18:11.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we readily forgive them

00:18:11.707 --> 00:18:15.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they’ve embarrassed us
or hurt our feelings.

00:18:15.444 --> 00:18:18.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Overall, Jehovah’s people do quite well

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in honoring one another 
in the congregation.

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:23.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But here is the question:

00:18:23.585 --> 00:18:26.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we improving in this aspect

00:18:26.855 --> 00:18:29.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our Christian personality?

00:18:29.725 --> 00:18:31.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our theme scripture,

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul didn’t just say
to honor one another.

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:38.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said to “widen out” or reach out

00:18:38.534 --> 00:18:41.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this aspect of our Christian life.

00:18:41.403 --> 00:18:45.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His words were to “take the lead.”

00:18:45.474 --> 00:18:49.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Paul had just said
to show honor to each other,

00:18:49.211 --> 00:18:51.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would be like a teacher

00:18:51.213 --> 00:18:55.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
urging a group
of literate students to learn to read.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:59.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they’re literate,
they don’t need to learn to read.

00:18:59.288 --> 00:19:03.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what might the teacher
be urging them to do?

00:19:03.091 --> 00:19:07.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He might encourage them
to read better, or to improve.

00:19:08.831 --> 00:19:12.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Love is the identifying mark
of Christ’s disciples.

00:19:12.501 --> 00:19:16.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So honor is something
we’ve learned to show.

00:19:16.638 --> 00:19:19.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, like the teacher,

00:19:19.308 --> 00:19:22.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul is urging us
to improve in this area.

00:19:22.945 --> 00:19:26.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said take the lead
in showing honor.

00:19:26.882 --> 00:19:29.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The footnote says
this could be rendered

00:19:29.618 --> 00:19:33.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taking the “initiative”
in showing honor.

00:19:34.056 --> 00:19:35.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of waiting

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:38.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for some obvious reason
to do good for others

00:19:38.393 --> 00:19:41.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to commend someone,
to check on a shut-in—

00:19:41.263 --> 00:19:44.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
look for opportunities
to take the initiative

00:19:44.633 --> 00:19:48.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show honor in the family
and in our congregations.

00:19:49.638 --> 00:19:54.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, “in showing honor . . . ,
 take the lead”!
