Do you sometimes feel completely overwhelmed

00:00:04.554 --> 00:00:07.157 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when life’s problems cause you anxiety?

00:00:07.157 --> 00:00:10.226 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Just trying to provide the necessities

00:00:10.226 --> 00:00:13.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for one’s family can lead to anxiety.

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the same time,

00:00:15.131 --> 00:00:19.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might be dealing
with a chronic or life-threatening illness,

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:22.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
caring for a sick or elderly relative,

00:00:22.305 --> 00:00:25.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
grieving the death of a loved one,

00:00:25.341 --> 00:00:29.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
loneliness, a natural disaster,

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:33.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or maybe you’re struggling
with the devastating effects

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of past or present abuse.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you firmly believe
that God’s Kingdom will fix these problems,

00:00:41.224 --> 00:00:43.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that’s in the future.

00:00:43.727 --> 00:00:46.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about today?

00:00:46.663 --> 00:00:49.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps you feel like David,

00:00:49.032 --> 00:00:51.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who prayed at Psalm 13:2:

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:54.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How long will I have anxious concern,

00:00:54.938 --> 00:00:58.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with grief in my heart each day?”

00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:03.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A sister who has struggled
with anxiety for many years wrote this:

00:01:05.081 --> 00:01:10.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Anxiety robs me of sleep,
 impacts my health,

00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:15.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
affects the way I treat others,
and makes me want to give up.”

00:01:15.024 --> 00:01:19.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She added: “Anxiety is like a monster

00:01:19.763 --> 00:01:24.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that lives in my body
somewhere between my heart and my belly.

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:28.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I cannot wait for Jehovah
to kill that monster in the new world.

00:01:28.738 --> 00:01:33.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But until then,
the monster snarls and tears at my insides

00:01:33.743 --> 00:01:37.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tries to take over my life.”

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you identify with her feelings?

00:01:40.917 --> 00:01:44.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We often hear a person say concerning anxiety:

00:01:44.554 --> 00:01:48.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’m just trying to take it one day at a time.”

00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:50.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But one brother put it this way:

00:01:50.727 --> 00:01:53.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I try to take it one day at a time,

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:56.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but sometimes several days attack me at once.”

00:01:58.168 --> 00:02:03.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For so many of us, anxiety is a daily struggle.

00:02:04.474 --> 00:02:06.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you battle with anxiety,

00:02:06.643 --> 00:02:10.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please know this: You are not alone.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not give up the fight.

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:17.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah and Jesus are aware of the anxieties

00:02:17.687 --> 00:02:21.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that weigh on your mind
and that are deep in your heart.

00:02:21.624 --> 00:02:26.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body
knows that living in this system of things

00:02:26.162 --> 00:02:28.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is especially “hard to deal with.”

00:02:28.631 --> 00:02:32.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the theme chosen for this program is

00:02:32.135 --> 00:02:37.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Deal With Anxiety One Day at a Time.”

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, what is anxiety?

00:02:41.044 --> 00:02:43.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Christian Greek Scriptures,

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the word “anxious” occurs 19 times.

00:02:47.183 --> 00:02:51.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first occurrence
is in Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Jesus knew that people
worried about how to provide for their family.

00:02:55.692 --> 00:02:59.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So at Matthew 6:25,

00:02:59.696 --> 00:03:02.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he gave this wise counsel:

00:03:02.532 --> 00:03:05.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On this account I say to you:

00:03:05.301 --> 00:03:07.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Stop being anxious about your lives

00:03:07.904 --> 00:03:11.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as to what you will eat or what you will drink,

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:14.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or about your bodies as to what you will wear.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Does not life mean more than food

00:03:17.247 --> 00:03:20.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the body than clothing?”

00:03:20.516 --> 00:03:24.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Study Bible note for verse 25

00:03:24.153 --> 00:03:27.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says that “the Greek term for ‘anxious’

00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:31.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“can refer to worry that divides a person’s mind

00:03:31.027 --> 00:03:34.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and distracts him, robbing him of joy.”

00:03:34.697 --> 00:03:37.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Luke 12:29,

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus says to “stop being in anxious suspense”

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:43.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to “stop worrying.”

00:03:43.706 --> 00:03:45.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The study note here says

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:49.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Greek word
for “anxious suspense” was used

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:52.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to refer “to ships being tossed at sea.”

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:56.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says that Jesus used it “figuratively

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:59.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for being anxious or unsettled,

00:03:59.255 --> 00:04:02.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as if tossed about or wavering

00:04:02.058 --> 00:04:05.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of doubt and anxiety.”

00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:08.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By saying “stop being anxious,”

00:04:08.932 --> 00:04:13.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus recognizes
that anxiety is already in progress.

00:04:13.403 --> 00:04:17.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is very aware of our imperfect nature.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows that we tend
to bring our worries from yesterday

00:04:21.077 --> 00:04:24.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(the would-haves,
could-haves, and should-haves)

00:04:24.714 --> 00:04:27.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our imagined worries about tomorrow

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(the what-ifs) to today.

00:04:31.487 --> 00:04:33.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But ask yourself,

00:04:33.489 --> 00:04:38.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How often have I worried myself
sick about what might happen tomorrow,

00:04:38.227 --> 00:04:43.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only to find that tomorrow
wasn’t nearly as bad as I feared it would be?’

00:04:44.567 --> 00:04:48.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus also knows that anxiety can have real,

00:04:48.171 --> 00:04:51.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometimes painful, consequences.

00:04:51.307 --> 00:04:55.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can stop us from making spiritual progress.

00:04:55.178 --> 00:04:59.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Overthinking and overanalyzing our problems

00:04:59.248 --> 00:05:02.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can literally shut us down.

00:05:02.251 --> 00:05:05.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How, though, can we “stop being anxious”?

00:05:05.788 --> 00:05:08.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the antidote?

00:05:08.224 --> 00:05:12.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider four practical things we can do.

00:05:12.962 --> 00:05:15.732 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
First, rely on Jehovah

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:19.535 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and take one day at a time.

00:05:19.535 --> 00:05:22.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is exactly what Jesus prescribed for us

00:05:22.972 --> 00:05:27.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Matthew 6:33, 34:

00:05:27.977 --> 00:05:31.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep on, then, seeking first the Kingdom

00:05:31.514 --> 00:05:33.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and his righteousness,

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:36.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and all these other things will be added to you.

00:05:36.185 --> 00:05:40.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So never be anxious about the next day,

00:05:40.556 --> 00:05:44.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for the next day will have its own anxieties.

00:05:44.327 --> 00:05:48.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each day has enough of its own troubles.”

00:05:48.398 --> 00:05:51.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 34 has a study note

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
telling us that “undue anxiety
about what may happen in the future

00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:59.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“can adversely affect
a person’s relationship with God,

00:05:59.342 --> 00:06:04.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
causing him to rely
on his own wisdom rather than on God’s.”

00:06:04.347 --> 00:06:06.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the lesson?

00:06:06.682 --> 00:06:09.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of relying on ourselves,

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:14.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rely on Jehovah, and take one day at a time.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A cross-reference to Matthew 6:34

00:06:17.527 --> 00:06:20.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
takes us to Exodus 16:4.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this account,

00:06:22.165 --> 00:06:25.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah provided
the Israelites with enough manna

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:29.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for every day of their 40-year trek.

00:06:29.505 --> 00:06:31.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could Jehovah have provided

00:06:31.674 --> 00:06:36.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a week’s worth of manna?
a month’s worth? a year’s worth?

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:38.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course.

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:42.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why did
he only provide enough for each day?

00:06:42.752 --> 00:06:44.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, think about it.

00:06:44.754 --> 00:06:47.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they stepped out
of their tents each morning,

00:06:47.757 --> 00:06:52.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was no question whether
there would be manna on the ground or not,

00:06:52.762 --> 00:06:56.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there was
no question where it came from.

00:06:56.566 --> 00:07:00.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah never failed to provide for their needs,

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:02.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not even for one day.

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:06.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They also knew from the past that Jehovah

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:10.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
always provided for those who were loyal to him.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We too can look back
at how Jehovah provided for his servants.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:18.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can have
complete confidence that Jehovah knows exactly

00:07:18.554 --> 00:07:21.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what we need when we need it

00:07:21.357 --> 00:07:26.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—for today, tomorrow, and for all eternity.

00:07:26.362 --> 00:07:29.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even if we have such confidence,

00:07:29.198 --> 00:07:32.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why do we sometimes continue to feel anxious?

00:07:32.902 --> 00:07:35.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The simple answer:

00:07:35.071 --> 00:07:37.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re imperfect people trying our best

00:07:37.807 --> 00:07:41.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve Jehovah in Satan’s wicked world.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:46.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daily challenges cause anxiety
that can make us forget to rely on Jehovah

00:07:46.315 --> 00:07:48.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take one day at a time.

00:07:48.651 --> 00:07:53.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we need to add
our second way to deal with anxiety:

00:07:53.322 --> 00:07:55.391 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Pour your heart out

00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:58.461 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah in earnest prayer.

00:07:58.461 --> 00:08:00.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read with me the reassuring words

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:03.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Philippians 4:6, 7:

00:08:03.966 --> 00:08:07.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be anxious over anything,

00:08:07.537 --> 00:08:10.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but in everything by prayer

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and supplication along with thanksgiving,

00:08:13.976 --> 00:08:17.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“let your petitions be made known to God;

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:20.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the peace of God that surpasses

00:08:20.483 --> 00:08:23.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“all understanding will guard your hearts

00:08:23.553 --> 00:08:27.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.”

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul doesn’t simply tell us not to be anxious,

00:08:31.427 --> 00:08:33.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he tells us how.

00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:37.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said “by prayer and supplication,”

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is earnest and specific prayer.

00:08:41.537 --> 00:08:43.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With what benefit?

00:08:43.739 --> 00:08:48.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The “peace of God . . . will guard your hearts.”

00:08:49.645 --> 00:08:52.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Guard” was a military expression referring to troops

00:08:52.481 --> 00:08:54.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
assigned to protect a city.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The inhabitants could sleep soundly

00:08:57.587 --> 00:09:01.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing that soldiers were guarding them at night.

00:09:01.457 --> 00:09:05.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a similar way,
when we have “the peace of God,”

00:09:05.561 --> 00:09:08.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our hearts and minds can rest.

00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:13.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This can prevent us from being
overwhelmed by anxiety or discouragement.

00:09:13.436 --> 00:09:17.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How reassuring are the words of the psalmist

00:09:17.139 --> 00:09:20.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Psalm 4:8:

00:09:20.443 --> 00:09:24.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will lie down and sleep in peace,

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for you alone, O Jehovah,

00:09:26.716 --> 00:09:29.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make me dwell in security.”

00:09:29.885 --> 00:09:34.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we feel trapped,
like there’s no way out of our worries,

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:38.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the peace from God gives us hope

00:09:38.327 --> 00:09:41.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there’s light at the end of the tunnel.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What, though, must you do?

00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:49.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn your worries into deep, heartfelt prayers.

00:09:49.171 --> 00:09:53.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, at 1 Peter 5:7,

00:09:53.109 --> 00:09:56.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah invites you
to “throw all your anxiety on him,

00:09:56.779 --> 00:09:58.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[and leave it with him]

00:09:58.881 --> 00:10:02.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he cares for you.”

00:10:02.051 --> 00:10:07.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is the one person
who truly understands how you feel.

00:10:07.056 --> 00:10:10.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows every moment of your life

00:10:10.159 --> 00:10:13.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—why you feel or react a certain way.

00:10:13.496 --> 00:10:17.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He loves and values you personally

00:10:17.166 --> 00:10:20.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite your imperfections, your anxieties,

00:10:20.936 --> 00:10:23.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your cares and worries.

00:10:23.406 --> 00:10:28.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He not only has
the power to help you, he wants to.

00:10:29.545 --> 00:10:33.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Knowing this
should move you to pray specifically,

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:36.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
expressing your deepest emotions

00:10:36.952 --> 00:10:41.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pleading
that he grant you peace of mind and heart.

00:10:41.957 --> 00:10:44.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To the extent you do so,

00:10:44.393 --> 00:10:46.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
1 Peter 5:10 promises

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:49.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “he will make you firm,

00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:51.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he will make you strong,

00:10:51.634 --> 00:10:56.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will firmly ground you.”

00:10:56.238 --> 00:11:00.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never underestimate the power of prayer!

00:11:00.009 --> 00:11:02.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is always ready to help you

00:11:02.945 --> 00:11:06.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one day at a time.

00:11:06.215 --> 00:11:09.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our third way to deal with anxiety

00:11:09.452 --> 00:11:14.256 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is to read and meditate on God’s Word.

00:11:14.256 --> 00:11:16.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let Jehovah speak to you.

00:11:16.292 --> 00:11:21.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Allow Jehovah’s thoughts to become your thoughts.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:24.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Psalm 94:19,

00:11:24.233 --> 00:11:29.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how the psalmist admitted his own anxiety:

00:11:29.071 --> 00:11:32.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When anxieties overwhelmed me,

00:11:32.408 --> 00:11:37.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you comforted and soothed me.”

00:11:37.012 --> 00:11:41.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, even servants of God
can feel overwhelmed by anxieties

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:46.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or, as one translation says,
“burdened with worries.”

00:11:46.188 --> 00:11:48.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That in itself is comforting

00:11:48.891 --> 00:11:52.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that an inspired Bible writer
struggled with anxieties.

00:11:52.828 --> 00:11:57.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah “comforted and soothed” him,

00:11:57.733 --> 00:12:00.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
calming his troubled heart.

00:12:00.302 --> 00:12:02.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God can do the same for us

00:12:02.872 --> 00:12:05.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through his inspired Word, the Bible.

00:12:05.274 --> 00:12:09.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember,
the Bible is how Jehovah speaks to us.

00:12:09.912 --> 00:12:13.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather than allowing our emotions to run wild,

00:12:13.616 --> 00:12:18.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can learn to focus
our mind on upbuilding things,

00:12:18.354 --> 00:12:23.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as what
the apostle Paul listed at Philippians 4:8:

00:12:23.359 --> 00:12:28.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Finally, brothers, whatever things are true,

00:12:28.364 --> 00:12:31.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are of serious concern,

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are righteous,

00:12:33.669 --> 00:12:35.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are chaste,

00:12:35.704 --> 00:12:37.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are lovable,

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are well-spoken-of,

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:42.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are virtuous,

00:12:42.511 --> 00:12:45.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and whatever things are praiseworthy,

00:12:45.047 --> 00:12:49.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
continue considering these things.”

00:12:49.285 --> 00:12:53.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The footnote to verse 8 shows that “considering”

00:12:53.289 --> 00:12:57.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
involves “thinking about” or “meditating on.”

00:12:57.626 --> 00:13:02.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can and should
meditate on positive things from the Bible,

00:13:02.631 --> 00:13:07.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
replacing negative things
that may enter our mind and cause anxiety.

00:13:07.636 --> 00:13:11.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ask Jehovah to help you to find passages

00:13:11.941 --> 00:13:15.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his Word that will soothe your heart.

00:13:15.344 --> 00:13:20.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ask others what scriptures have calmed
their heart during anxious moments.

00:13:20.349 --> 00:13:23.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make your own personal list.

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:25.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then set aside time to read

00:13:25.955 --> 00:13:28.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditate on those passages.

00:13:28.924 --> 00:13:33.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meditation is the doorway to your heart.

00:13:33.429 --> 00:13:36.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meditation lets God’s thoughts affect you

00:13:36.932 --> 00:13:39.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the deepest possible level.

00:13:39.835 --> 00:13:43.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine that Jehovah is speaking directly to you,

00:13:43.539 --> 00:13:45.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he is.

00:13:45.708 --> 00:13:49.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never underestimate the power of God’s Word

00:13:49.311 --> 00:13:52.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—of letting Jehovah speak to you.

00:13:52.882 --> 00:13:56.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our fourth way to deal with anxiety

00:13:56.252 --> 00:14:00.189 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is to share your feelings with a trusted friend.

00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:04.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 12:25 says:

00:14:04.093 --> 00:14:08.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it down

00:14:08.197 --> 00:14:11.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[or, as the footnote says, ‘depresses him’],

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but a good word cheers it up.”

00:14:14.103 --> 00:14:17.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A good word” can come from a fellow believer

00:14:17.406 --> 00:14:22.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is motivated
by God’s spirit and guided by his Word.

00:14:22.177 --> 00:14:25.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the apostle Paul was alone in prison,

00:14:25.247 --> 00:14:27.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he prayed for encouragement

00:14:27.716 --> 00:14:31.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah provided
what he needed to cheer him up.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With a heart full of appreciation,

00:14:34.223 --> 00:14:36.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said at Colossians 4:11

00:14:36.625 --> 00:14:39.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “my fellow workers  . . . have become

00:14:39.061 --> 00:14:41.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a source of great comfort to me,”

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “a strengthening aid.”

00:14:44.867 --> 00:14:49.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can you do if you feel
weighed down or imprisoned by anxiety?

00:14:49.872 --> 00:14:54.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Paul, pray for encouragement.

00:14:54.109 --> 00:14:56.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray for someone you can talk to,

00:14:56.178 --> 00:14:59.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
someone you can trust with your feelings.

00:14:59.281 --> 00:15:02.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer to your prayer may be an elder

00:15:02.785 --> 00:15:06.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a mature Christian brother or sister.

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:08.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if it’s difficult for you

00:15:08.891 --> 00:15:12.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to open up to others and confide in them?

00:15:12.628 --> 00:15:17.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try the advice
in the March 1, 1997, Watchtower article

00:15:17.633 --> 00:15:20.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Are You Afraid to Trust Others?”

00:15:20.002 --> 00:15:22.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When confiding in someone

00:15:22.705 --> 00:15:26.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says: “Reveal your concerns gradually.

00:15:26.275 --> 00:15:29.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If he [or she] responds in an appropriate,

00:15:29.278 --> 00:15:31.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“sympathetic, and discreet way,

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might then try disclosing more.”

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:38.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even if it takes some effort,

00:15:38.253 --> 00:15:42.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
never underestimate the power of our brotherhood.

00:15:42.691 --> 00:15:45.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can use a fellow worshipper

00:15:45.094 --> 00:15:48.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to ease your mind of “anxious concern.”

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:51.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even at times when there’s no one to talk to,

00:15:51.734 --> 00:15:54.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can let the experiences,

00:15:54.103 --> 00:15:56.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
upbuilding music,

00:15:56.538 --> 00:15:59.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and talks on JW Broadcasting® be like

00:15:59.475 --> 00:16:03.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an encouraging hug from a trusted friend.

00:16:03.512 --> 00:16:08.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, when we make the effort,
we give Jehovah something to bless.

00:16:08.517 --> 00:16:13.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can help us
conquer the seemingly unconquerable.

00:16:13.522 --> 00:16:17.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That may not mean
that we’ll completely eliminate anxiety,

00:16:17.493 --> 00:16:20.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we can learn to take control.

00:16:20.496 --> 00:16:22.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:16:22.498 --> 00:16:24.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember our four ways:

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, rely on Jehovah

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:30.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take one day at time;

00:16:30.305 --> 00:16:33.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
second, pour out your heart

00:16:33.342 --> 00:16:37.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah in earnest, specific prayer;

00:16:37.179 --> 00:16:40.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
third, read and meditate on God’s Word

00:16:40.983 --> 00:16:43.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—let Jehovah speak to you;

00:16:43.886 --> 00:16:47.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fourth, share your feelings with a trusted friend.

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:49.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah’s help,

00:16:49.825 --> 00:16:54.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can deal with anxiety one day at a time.
