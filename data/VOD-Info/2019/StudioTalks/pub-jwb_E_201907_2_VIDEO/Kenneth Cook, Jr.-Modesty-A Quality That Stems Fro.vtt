00:00:02.385 --> 00:00:04.387 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
One of the most underrated qualities

00:00:04.387 --> 00:00:07.190 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in today’s world is modesty.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.492 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In fact, the world encourages

00:00:09.492 --> 00:00:11.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the exact opposite of modesty.

00:00:11.861 --> 00:00:15.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world says that you are
the most important person;

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you should promote yourself;
you have no limits;

00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:23.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have the right to be anything you want to be.

00:00:24.374 --> 00:00:28.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we’ll see, the world’s thinking
is completely backward

00:00:28.645 --> 00:00:30.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and for several reasons.

00:00:30.814 --> 00:00:33.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really, modesty is a quality

00:00:33.683 --> 00:00:36.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that stems from everything that is good.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our theme scripture
for this discussion is Micah 6:8:

00:00:43.026 --> 00:00:45.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He has told you . . . what is good.

00:00:45.695 --> 00:00:48.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And what is Jehovah requiring of you?

00:00:48.398 --> 00:00:53.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Only to exercise justice, to cherish loyalty,

00:00:53.103 --> 00:00:57.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to walk in modesty with your God!”

00:00:57.107 --> 00:00:59.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice that modesty is one

00:00:59.275 --> 00:01:02.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the key aspects of “what is good.”

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To help us understand why,

00:01:04.848 --> 00:01:06.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s discuss three questions:

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is modesty?

00:01:09.385 --> 00:01:12.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do we want to have this quality?

00:01:12.355 --> 00:01:14.357 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
How can we cultivate it?

00:01:14.357 --> 00:01:17.227 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
First, what is modesty?

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:22.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Basically, it’s an awareness of our limitations.

00:01:22.732 --> 00:01:24.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we often link modesty

00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:27.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with appropriate dress and grooming,

00:01:27.303 --> 00:01:29.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but much more is involved.

00:01:29.773 --> 00:01:31.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we know?

00:01:31.775 --> 00:01:35.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider what we read at Proverbs 11:2:

00:01:35.945 --> 00:01:38.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When presumptuousness comes,

00:01:38.715 --> 00:01:40.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“dishonor will follow,

00:01:40.717 --> 00:01:43.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but wisdom is with the modest ones.”

00:01:44.654 --> 00:01:46.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice that modesty is contrasted

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a negative quality—presumptuousness.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A presumptuous person
runs ahead without the authority to do so.

00:01:55.331 --> 00:01:58.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He or she ignores
proper boundaries and limitations.

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:02.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That kind of attitude
often leads to foolish mistakes

00:02:02.806 --> 00:02:05.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a bad reputation with fellow humans.

00:02:05.508 --> 00:02:10.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And above all,
it can cause a person to lose God’s favor.

00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:14.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, we might think of King Saul.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although he started out as a modest young man,

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:20.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in time he became presumptuous.

00:02:20.456 --> 00:02:23.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He even went so far as to offer up

00:02:23.693 --> 00:02:28.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a burnt sacrifice
even though he was not authorized to do so.

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:30.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result,

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:33.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saul lost Jehovah’s favor

00:02:33.036 --> 00:02:35.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and eventually the kingship.

00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:38.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Saul’s case, presumptuousness definitely

00:02:38.808 --> 00:02:40.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
led to dishonor.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand,

00:02:42.812 --> 00:02:44.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a wise and modest person

00:02:44.814 --> 00:02:49.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recognizes his limitations and works within them.

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:53.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is modesty the course of wisdom?

00:02:53.156 --> 00:02:55.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This brings us to our second main point,

00:02:55.825 --> 00:02:58.661 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Why do we want to have this quality?

00:02:58.661 --> 00:03:00.864 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The foremost reason

00:03:00.864 --> 00:03:03.600 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is that modesty is essential

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pleasing our heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:09.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although we don’t speak
of Jehovah as being modest,

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:12.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even he works within certain limitations

00:03:12.375 --> 00:03:14.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he’s imposed on himself.

00:03:14.777 --> 00:03:19.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He teaches us by example
how to demonstrate this quality,

00:03:19.215 --> 00:03:22.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though it’s not one that he needs to display.

00:03:23.653 --> 00:03:28.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can we say that Jehovah
imposes limitations on himself?

00:03:28.424 --> 00:03:30.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider just one example:

00:03:30.894 --> 00:03:35.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll never violate
the gift of free will that he’s granted us.

00:03:35.698 --> 00:03:38.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will never force us to serve him

00:03:38.935 --> 00:03:42.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even though, of course,
he has the power to do so.

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:46.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aren’t we grateful that he allows us to serve him

00:03:46.542 --> 00:03:48.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we choose to out of love

00:03:48.778 --> 00:03:50.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not because we are forced to?

00:03:52.548 --> 00:03:56.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah teaches us
to display modesty in other ways as well.

00:03:56.352 --> 00:04:00.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, we might think
of how he listened patiently

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:04.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Abraham voiced his concerns
about Jehovah’s purpose

00:04:04.427 --> 00:04:07.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah

00:04:07.263 --> 00:04:11.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or how Jehovah invited
the angels to suggest ways to fool Ahab

00:04:11.234 --> 00:04:15.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then authorized
one of their suggestions to be carried out.

00:04:16.205 --> 00:04:18.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the lesson for us?

00:04:18.574 --> 00:04:22.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Jehovah, who doesn’t need
input or help from anyone,

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:24.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
patiently listens and delegates,

00:04:24.914 --> 00:04:27.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how much more should we do so

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—especially since
we’re all so imperfect and limited!

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you a family head
or an elder in the congregation,

00:04:35.124 --> 00:04:39.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or do you have
another responsible position in the organization?

00:04:39.162 --> 00:04:42.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, you can imitate Jehovah

00:04:42.332 --> 00:04:45.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by not micromanaging others.

00:04:45.268 --> 00:04:48.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be willing to delegate tasks to them

00:04:48.137 --> 00:04:50.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and listen to their suggestions.

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:54.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imitate Jehovah’s example of dignifying others

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wanting to help them succeed.

00:04:58.348 --> 00:05:00.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides pleasing Jehovah,

00:05:00.416 --> 00:05:03.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have other good reasons to be modest.

00:05:03.653 --> 00:05:06.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Modesty helps us to be joyful.

00:05:06.622 --> 00:05:08.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?

00:05:08.624 --> 00:05:13.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By going hand in hand
with a related quality—gratitude.

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A faithful brother who worked
in the Writing Department

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:19.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for some 50 years was fond of saying,

00:05:19.435 --> 00:05:22.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Only a grateful person can be happy.”

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:26.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re modestly aware of our limitations,

00:05:26.275 --> 00:05:28.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll be grateful and happy

00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:31.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the help that we receive from others.

00:05:31.247 --> 00:05:33.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:35.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think of the leper who returned

00:05:35.318 --> 00:05:37.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to thank Jesus for healing him.

00:05:37.787 --> 00:05:40.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This man realized his limitations.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was very thankful that Jesus
had done something for him

00:05:44.527 --> 00:05:47.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he could never have done on his own.

00:05:48.798 --> 00:05:51.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another reason to cultivate modesty

00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:55.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that it promotes good relationships with others.

00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:57.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s face it:

00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:59.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People aren’t usually drawn to those who think,

00:05:59.942 --> 00:06:02.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If I want something done right,

00:06:02.545 --> 00:06:04.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have to do it myself.’

00:06:05.815 --> 00:06:08.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they usually appreciate it when they’re shown

00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:10.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have confidence in them.

00:06:10.686 --> 00:06:13.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This, in turn, draws them to us.

00:06:15.024 --> 00:06:18.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another way that modesty
promotes good relationships

00:06:18.394 --> 00:06:22.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that it helps us
to avoid comparing ourselves to others.

00:06:22.932 --> 00:06:25.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Comparing ourselves to others

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:29.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is always a dangerous road to navigate.

00:06:29.005 --> 00:06:32.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just think, for example, of Jesus’ apostles

00:06:32.575 --> 00:06:36.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who argued many times over
who was the greatest

00:06:38.347 --> 00:06:41.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or of Joseph’s brothers
and the terrible things they did

00:06:41.551 --> 00:06:44.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of being jealous of Joseph.

00:06:44.554 --> 00:06:47.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A modest person doesn’t obsess

00:06:47.056 --> 00:06:50.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over his perceived rank in comparison with others.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this regard,

00:06:52.862 --> 00:06:55.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can remember the good example of Moses.

00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:57.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did he react when Jehovah

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enabled some of his fellow Israelites

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:03.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to begin acting as prophets alongside him?

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:05.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses rejoiced,

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:09.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
saying that he wished all
of Jehovah’s people were prophets.

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:14.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses didn’t feel that he was
the only one who should have such a privilege.

00:07:15.918 --> 00:07:20.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, modesty promotes
good relationships with others

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:24.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it prevents us
from bragging about our accomplishments

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or drawing undue attention to ourselves,

00:07:27.363 --> 00:07:29.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which could stir up resentment in others.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now we know what modesty is
and why we want to have it.

00:07:35.104 --> 00:07:37.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This brings us to our third main point,

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:41.878 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
How can we cultivate this beautiful quality?

00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:43.880 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
One thing we can do

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to read and meditate on Bible examples

00:07:47.116 --> 00:07:51.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—both good and bad—
such as those we just discussed.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Other Bible examples include Daniel,

00:07:54.323 --> 00:07:56.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who modestly didn’t take credit

00:07:56.325 --> 00:07:59.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the interpretation
of King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream.

00:07:59.829 --> 00:08:01.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The lesson for us?

00:08:01.831 --> 00:08:04.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re privileged to have a teaching assignment

00:08:04.967 --> 00:08:08.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or we enjoy a measure of success in the ministry,

00:08:08.237 --> 00:08:11.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to give all the glory to Jehovah.

00:08:11.707 --> 00:08:14.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should modestly recognize

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:16.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we couldn’t do these things without his help.

00:08:18.147 --> 00:08:20.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can also study the example of Jesus,

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who didn’t even think of trying to grasp

00:08:23.252 --> 00:08:26.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for more authority than Jehovah had granted him.

00:08:26.155 --> 00:08:29.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philippians 2:6 tells us:

00:08:29.725 --> 00:08:32.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He . . . gave no consideration to a seizure,

00:08:32.962 --> 00:08:36.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
namely, that he should be equal to God.”

00:08:36.899 --> 00:08:39.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider how Jesus responded

00:08:39.202 --> 00:08:41.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when his disciples James
and John approached him

00:08:41.904 --> 00:08:44.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their mother
and asked for a privilege

00:08:44.807 --> 00:08:47.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was beyond his authority to grant them.

00:08:48.644 --> 00:08:50.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus modestly acknowledged

00:08:50.646 --> 00:08:53.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that only Jehovah could decide

00:08:53.349 --> 00:08:56.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would sit at his right
and left hand in the Kingdom.

00:08:56.886 --> 00:09:00.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus respected his limitations.

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:04.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are some other ways
we can cultivate modesty?

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One is to apply the Bible’s counsel

00:09:07.263 --> 00:09:10.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found at 1 Corinthians 4:6:

00:09:10.833 --> 00:09:14.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not go beyond the things that are written.”

00:09:14.237 --> 00:09:18.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This refers primarily
to ‘the things written’ in God’s Word.

00:09:18.274 --> 00:09:23.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By extension, the principle
also applies to the Scriptural direction

00:09:23.045 --> 00:09:25.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we receive from our publications.

00:09:25.748 --> 00:09:27.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When asked for advice,

00:09:27.883 --> 00:09:31.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would never want to impose our own opinion

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or simply give an answer off the top of our head.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:37.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, we want to direct attention

00:09:37.226 --> 00:09:39.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the counsel found in the Bible

00:09:39.362 --> 00:09:42.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Bible-based publications.

00:09:42.131 --> 00:09:45.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another way we can cultivate modesty

00:09:45.401 --> 00:09:47.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is by asking for frank comments

00:09:47.803 --> 00:09:49.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a trusted friend

00:09:49.805 --> 00:09:53.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as to whether or not
we have a reputation for being modest.

00:09:53.943 --> 00:09:58.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this regard, we remember the Bible principle:

00:09:58.214 --> 00:10:00.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As iron sharpens iron,

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so one man sharpens his friend.”

00:10:03.953 --> 00:10:06.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If someone is willing to offer

00:10:06.355 --> 00:10:09.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
kind observations about how we can improve,

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:12.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we wouldn’t want to bristle at the comments.

00:10:12.395 --> 00:10:16.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Granted, it may sting our pride
to hear such honest feedback,

00:10:16.999 --> 00:10:21.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but don’t we all need
to hear these things from time to time?

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As imperfect humans,

00:10:23.172 --> 00:10:26.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each one of us has blind spots, as it were.

00:10:26.742 --> 00:10:30.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s hard to see ourselves the way others see us.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:35.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, we can work
to improve our Christian personality

00:10:35.518 --> 00:10:40.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—but only if we know
the areas that could use some improvement.

00:10:40.156 --> 00:10:43.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can’t change what we don’t see.

00:10:43.192 --> 00:10:45.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A word of caution:

00:10:45.194 --> 00:10:48.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to beware of false modesty.

00:10:48.397 --> 00:10:52.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember that it’s not
about simply appearing modest

00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:55.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but actually being modest at heart.

00:10:55.237 --> 00:10:57.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To help us examine ourselves,

00:10:57.907 --> 00:11:01.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we might meditate on questions like these:

00:11:01.243 --> 00:11:04.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I receive advice or counsel,

00:11:04.213 --> 00:11:07.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how do I really feel about it at heart?

00:11:07.616 --> 00:11:11.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does my internal reaction
depend on whether the person giving it

00:11:11.721 --> 00:11:16.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has less or more experience
or authority than I do?

00:11:16.058 --> 00:11:21.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Am I willing to accept valid suggestions
regardless of who offers them?

00:11:22.398 --> 00:11:24.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A final way we can develop true modesty

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to ask Jehovah to help us.

00:11:27.703 --> 00:11:32.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know what James 1:17 says:

00:11:32.475 --> 00:11:37.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Every good gift and every perfect present is from above,

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:41.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
coming down from the Father of the celestial lights.”

00:11:41.684 --> 00:11:46.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since modesty is one of Jehovah’s good gifts to us,

00:11:46.188 --> 00:11:49.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can be sure that if we pray to Jehovah and ask him

00:11:49.558 --> 00:11:51.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us cultivate this quality,

00:11:51.894 --> 00:11:55.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’ll answer our sincere prayers.

00:11:55.264 --> 00:11:58.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In review, what is modesty?

00:11:58.734 --> 00:12:02.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a proper recognition of our limitations.

00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:05.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do we want to have this quality?

00:12:05.207 --> 00:12:07.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because it pleases Jehovah,

00:12:07.676 --> 00:12:10.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it promotes good relationships with others,

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it adds to our joy.

00:12:13.682 --> 00:12:16.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we cultivate modesty?

00:12:16.452 --> 00:12:18.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many ways:

00:12:18.521 --> 00:12:22.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can meditate on Bible examples,
both good and bad,

00:12:22.258 --> 00:12:25.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then apply the lessons in our own life.

00:12:25.761 --> 00:12:30.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should apply the counsel
to ‘not go beyond the things written.’

00:12:30.266 --> 00:12:32.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can ask others for honest feedback

00:12:32.935 --> 00:12:35.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on how we’re doing in showing this quality.

00:12:35.404 --> 00:12:38.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And above all, we can pray to Jehovah

00:12:38.641 --> 00:12:42.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ask him to help us develop it more fully.

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:45.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we think of all the positive ways

00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:48.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that modesty benefits ourselves and others,

00:12:48.083 --> 00:12:50.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wouldn’t you agree that it truly is a quality

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that comes from “what is good”?
