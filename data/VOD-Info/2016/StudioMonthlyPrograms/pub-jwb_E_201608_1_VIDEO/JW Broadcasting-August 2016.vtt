Welcome to another edition
of JW Broadcasting.

00:00:06.256 --> 00:00:08.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here are this month’s highlights:

00:00:08.558 --> 00:00:11.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is it like to engage
in the special metropolitan witnessing work

00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:15.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the bustling United States city
of San Francisco?

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:19.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll hear encouraging experiences
from brothers and sisters

00:00:19.636 --> 00:00:22.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
who preach 
in this diverse language field.

00:00:22.505 --> 00:00:25.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can young ones 
serve Jehovah successfully 

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:27.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if their family’s
spiritual activity stops?

00:00:28.978 --> 00:00:32.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll hear from a sister who tells
what kept her love for Jehovah growing

00:00:32.315 --> 00:00:36.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
throughout her family’s
busy show business career.

00:00:36.052 --> 00:00:38.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ll discuss

00:00:38.054 --> 00:00:40.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
the beautiful quality of loyalty,

00:00:40.857 --> 00:00:43.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
including an interview with a couple

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:47.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
who has served Jehovah loyally
for over 60 years.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
All this is ahead
on JW Broadcasting for August 2016.

00:01:11.554 --> 00:01:13.556 line:10% position:50% align:center
This month’s theme is taken

00:01:13.556 --> 00:01:15.892 line:10% position:50% align:center
from David’s poetic song to Jehovah

00:01:15.892 --> 00:01:18.962 line:10% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 18:25, which states:

00:01:18.962 --> 00:01:22.732 line:10% position:50% align:center
“With someone loyal you act in loyalty.”

00:01:22.732 --> 00:01:25.068 line:10% position:50% align:center
The Hebrew term “act in loyalty”

00:01:25.068 --> 00:01:27.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
reminds us
of God’s loyal love

00:01:27.504 --> 00:01:29.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that is love motivated
by commitment,

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
integrity, loyalty,
and deep attachment.

00:01:34.177 --> 00:01:37.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
So loyalty is more
than just a feeling;

00:01:37.413 --> 00:01:40.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is active;
it’s rooted in love.

00:01:40.283 --> 00:01:42.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
How comforting it is
to know that Jehovah

00:01:42.886 --> 00:01:47.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
lovingly attaches himself
to those who are loyal to him!

00:01:47.423 --> 00:01:49.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what motivated David
to write the words

00:01:49.893 --> 00:01:52.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 18:25?

00:01:52.061 --> 00:01:54.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
The superscription reveals
that it was composed

00:01:54.898 --> 00:01:58.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
after “Jehovah rescued him
from the hand of all his enemies

00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:01.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
and from the hand of Saul.”

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:04.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of the great joy
and relief he must have felt

00:02:04.507 --> 00:02:07.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
after experiencing firsthand 
Jehovah’s loyal love 

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:10.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
and mighty saving acts.

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:12.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, throughout his life, 

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:16.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
David experienced
disloyalty at its worst:

00:02:16.085 --> 00:02:19.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
from his king, Saul;
from his wife Michal;

00:02:19.856 --> 00:02:24.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
from his trusted counselor Ahithophel;
and from his son Absalom.

00:02:24.828 --> 00:02:29.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
He felt the deep hurt of betrayal
by those he trusted and loved most.

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:32.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
Loyalty is a choice.

00:02:32.702 --> 00:02:36.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we find when we look back
at David’s life?

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:40.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
David chose to stay loyal to God.

00:02:40.043 --> 00:02:43.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
From a humble shepherd boy
caring for his sheep

00:02:43.012 --> 00:02:45.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a valiant king
caring for the nation,

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:48.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
he proved
to be someone loyal,

00:02:48.484 --> 00:02:50.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
a man agreeable
to Jehovah’s heart.

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:55.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it can be a real test
to maintain loyalty to God

00:02:55.024 --> 00:02:57.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we face injustices.

00:02:57.427 --> 00:03:01.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine the desperate situation
that David and his mighty warriors

00:03:01.464 --> 00:03:03.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
experienced when they
were fugitives,

00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:07.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
forced to hide in the wilderness,
often low on provisions.

00:03:07.737 --> 00:03:11.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
They saw firsthand
King Saul’s jealous rage.

00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:15.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what choice did David make
when urged by his men

00:03:15.178 --> 00:03:18.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
to seize the opportunity
to take Saul’s life?

00:03:18.882 --> 00:03:21.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what David told his men

00:03:21.017 --> 00:03:24.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 1 Samuel 24:6:

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:28.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is unthinkable from Jehovah’s standpoint

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:30.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that I should do such a thing to my lord,

00:03:30.693 --> 00:03:32.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the anointed of Jehovah,

00:03:32.695 --> 00:03:34.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by lifting my hand against him,

00:03:34.597 --> 00:03:38.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
for he is the anointed of Jehovah.”

00:03:39.168 --> 00:03:42.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
David knew that if he remained loyal,

00:03:42.005 --> 00:03:44.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah would remain loyal to him

00:03:44.674 --> 00:03:46.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
—He would show him loyal love.

00:03:46.876 --> 00:03:49.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
He humbly put aside
his personal feelings

00:03:49.512 --> 00:03:52.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
and viewed matters
from Jehovah’s perspective.

00:03:52.448 --> 00:03:57.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
He chose to wait patiently
for Jehovah to “act in loyalty.”

00:03:58.087 --> 00:04:02.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll soon be facing
life-changing events foretold in the Bible

00:04:02.025 --> 00:04:06.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will test our loyalty
to Jehovah and his organization.

00:04:06.696 --> 00:04:10.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now is the time
to strengthen our loyalty!

00:04:10.366 --> 00:04:15.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we do, we can be sure
that Jehovah knows our circumstances

00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:17.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
—perhaps injustices
we have experienced—

00:04:17.807 --> 00:04:21.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will reward our loyal service.

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:24.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
So ask yourself, ‘What loyal actions

00:04:24.447 --> 00:04:27.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
will motivate Jehovah to be loyal to me?’

00:04:27.917 --> 00:04:30.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider three areas.

00:04:30.553 --> 00:04:31.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
First,

00:04:31.754 --> 00:04:33.823 line:10% position:50% align:center
we can be loyal to Jehovah

00:04:33.823 --> 00:04:35.858 line:10% position:50% align:center
by defending him.

00:04:35.858 --> 00:04:38.394 line:10% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah is the Sovereign of the universe.

00:04:38.394 --> 00:04:40.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we come to his defense?

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can learn how
from the fine example of Elihu!

00:04:45.068 --> 00:04:48.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the book of Job,
Elihu listened patiently as Job

00:04:48.638 --> 00:04:50.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his three false comforters spoke.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice Elihu’s reaction

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:56.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Job 32:2, 3:

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:59.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
“His anger blazed against Job

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:01.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for trying to prove himself right

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:03.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
“rather than God.

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:05.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He was also very angry

00:05:05.154 --> 00:05:06.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with Job’s three companions

00:05:06.756 --> 00:05:09.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because they could not find an answer

00:05:09.158 --> 00:05:12.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
but had declared God wicked.”

00:05:13.096 --> 00:05:17.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
A fire of righteous indignation
was burning inside young Elihu.

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:20.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Job 36:2, 3,

00:05:20.803 --> 00:05:24.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
he loyally comes
to Jehovah’s defense saying:

00:05:24.173 --> 00:05:25.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be patient with me

00:05:25.908 --> 00:05:28.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a little longer while I explain,

00:05:28.277 --> 00:05:29.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for I still have words to speak

00:05:29.946 --> 00:05:31.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
“on God’s behalf.

00:05:31.614 --> 00:05:33.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will speak comprehensively

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:35.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
“about what I know,

00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:37.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I will ascribe righteousness

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
to my Maker.”

00:05:38.988 --> 00:05:41.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elihu courageously proved loyal

00:05:41.491 --> 00:05:44.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
by praising,
and, yes, defending God.

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:49.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do we need to come
to Jehovah’s defense today?

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:53.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because our loving heavenly Father
is blasphemed in so many ways.

00:05:53.836 --> 00:05:56.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
False religions claim
that he’s part of a Trinity

00:05:56.739 --> 00:06:00.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he torments people
eternally in burning hell.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others say that he
does not exist or if he does,

00:06:03.713 --> 00:06:06.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
he doesn’t really care about us.

00:06:06.015 --> 00:06:10.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that such lies
come from Satan the Devil.

00:06:10.053 --> 00:06:12.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
We demonstrate our loyalty

00:06:12.055 --> 00:06:14.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
by speaking in defense of Jehovah,

00:06:14.957 --> 00:06:18.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
thereby proving
Satan the liar that he is.

00:06:18.094 --> 00:06:20.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
We boldly and zealously proclaim

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he does exist
as the almighty God;

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:26.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he is
wise, just, and loving,

00:06:26.903 --> 00:06:29.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he will soon
bring an end to all evil

00:06:29.739 --> 00:06:33.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reward his loyal ones
with eternal life.

00:06:33.076 --> 00:06:36.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah could make
the stones cry out in defense,

00:06:36.145 --> 00:06:40.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
yet he honors his loyal Witnesses
—you and me—

00:06:40.116 --> 00:06:42.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
with this fine privilege.

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:43.920 line:10% position:50% align:center
Second,

00:06:44.187 --> 00:06:46.789 line:10% position:50% align:center
we can be loyal to Jehovah by being loyal

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:49.025 line:10% position:50% align:center
to “the faithful and discreet slave,”

00:06:49.025 --> 00:06:51.060 line:10% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body.

00:06:51.227 --> 00:06:54.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah and Jesus are using 
“the faithful and discreet slave” 

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
to feed us spiritually, 
so we owe our loyalty to that slave. 

00:06:58.935 --> 00:07:00.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
But some may say, 

00:07:00.937 --> 00:07:04.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Isn’t the Governing Body 
made up of imperfect men?’ 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, it is. 

00:07:06.042 --> 00:07:09.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
The last perfect person to walk 
the earth was Jesus himself. 

00:07:09.912 --> 00:07:14.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is no perfect person 
or organization on the globe. 

00:07:14.383 --> 00:07:17.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as a long-time faithful brother
used to say,

00:07:17.086 --> 00:07:20.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is the best imperfect organization 
on earth.” 

00:07:20.923 --> 00:07:23.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus didn’t say 
the slave would be infallible. 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said it would be
<i>faithful</i><i> </i><i> </i>and <i>discreet</i>.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:31.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
The way we listen to
and obey the faithful slave

00:07:31.134 --> 00:07:35.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
has a direct bearing on the strength
of our friendship with God.

00:07:35.638 --> 00:07:38.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, it means our very life.

00:07:40.343 --> 00:07:41.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what if the Governing Body

00:07:41.978 --> 00:07:45.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
serves some spiritual food
that is not to our liking?

00:07:45.114 --> 00:07:47.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or what if we do not fully understand

00:07:47.984 --> 00:07:52.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
or agree with a clarification of a belief?

00:07:52.088 --> 00:07:55.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
On one occasion, Jesus’ followers,
including the apostle Peter,

00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
were confronted
with a new teaching.

00:07:58.661 --> 00:08:00.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did most react?

00:08:00.696 --> 00:08:05.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice John 6:60, it states:

00:08:05.201 --> 00:08:08.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When they heard this,
many of his disciples said:

00:08:08.604 --> 00:08:11.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘This speech is shocking;
who can listen to it?’”

00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:13.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
The result?

00:08:13.376 --> 00:08:15.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Continuing in verse 66:

00:08:15.645 --> 00:08:18.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Because of this, many of his disciples

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:20.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
“went off to the things behind

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:23.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
and would no longer walk with him.”

00:08:23.486 --> 00:08:27.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how did Peter respond
when Jesus asked them,

00:08:27.156 --> 00:08:29.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Are you too stumbled?’

00:08:29.158 --> 00:08:31.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
At John 6:68, we read:

00:08:31.661 --> 00:08:33.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Simon Peter answered him:

00:08:33.963 --> 00:08:36.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Lord, whom shall we go away to?

00:08:36.866 --> 00:08:40.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have sayings of everlasting life.’”

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:42.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
What loyalty!

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:45.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter’s loyalty
was based on solid evidence

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:48.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus was the Messiah.

00:08:48.311 --> 00:08:51.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
His loyalty
was evidence of his faith. 

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:56.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is the kind of loyalty
we want to imitate today.

00:08:56.619 --> 00:09:00.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are times we must wait on
Jehovah to clarify matters. 

00:09:00.923 --> 00:09:05.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the meantime,
may we prove ourselves loyal like Peter

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:08.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
and follow closely
the lead of the faithful slave,

00:09:08.998 --> 00:09:14.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
who closely follow
in the footsteps of their Master, Jesus.

00:09:14.003 --> 00:09:18.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, though, we receive
counsel that touches us personally.

00:09:18.207 --> 00:09:22.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance, on JW Broadcasting
we’ve received loving reminders

00:09:22.578 --> 00:09:25.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
from members of the Governing Body
to be forgiving,

00:09:25.781 --> 00:09:28.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
to honor Jehovah
with our valuable things,

00:09:28.417 --> 00:09:31.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to remain spiritually alert.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through <i>The Watchtower</i>
and at Christian meetings,

00:09:34.156 --> 00:09:37.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re reminded to be careful
about our dress and grooming,

00:09:37.093 --> 00:09:40.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
to choose good associates
and wholesome entertainment,

00:09:40.563 --> 00:09:43.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to remain morally clean.

00:09:43.499 --> 00:09:46.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are we quick to respond
and make needed adjustments

00:09:46.736 --> 00:09:51.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
or do we find ourselves wanting
to defend our personal rights?

00:09:52.441 --> 00:09:54.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
A situation
in the apostle Paul’s life

00:09:54.744 --> 00:09:57.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
tested his loyalty
to theocratic direction.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s found in Acts chapter 21.

00:10:00.783 --> 00:10:04.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you recall,
Paul arrived in Jerusalem in 56 C.E.

00:10:04.687 --> 00:10:07.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
after a very successful missionary tour.

00:10:07.189 --> 00:10:10.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can imagine his excitement
as he related in detail

00:10:10.726 --> 00:10:14.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the things God did among
the nations through his ministry.”

00:10:14.463 --> 00:10:17.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
After hearing
Paul’s extraordinary account,

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
the older men revealed to Paul

00:10:19.735 --> 00:10:23.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
a problem in Judea
that involved him personally.

00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:28.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Read what they said
at Acts 21:21:

00:10:29.378 --> 00:10:31.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But they [the Jewish believers]

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
“have heard it rumored about you

00:10:33.015 --> 00:10:35.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that you have been teaching all the Jews

00:10:35.017 --> 00:10:39.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
“among the nations an apostasy from Moses,

00:10:39.221 --> 00:10:41.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
“telling them not to circumcise their children

00:10:41.657 --> 00:10:45.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to follow the customary practices.”

00:10:45.294 --> 00:10:48.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, perhaps Paul thought,
‘Me, an apostate?

00:10:48.798 --> 00:10:51.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Really?
How can they say such a thing?

00:10:51.367 --> 00:10:53.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I just finished
my third missionary tour,

00:10:53.836 --> 00:10:56.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
and look how
Jehovah blessed the work!’

00:10:56.739 --> 00:11:00.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nevertheless, the older men
gave Paul very clear direction

00:11:00.776 --> 00:11:04.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Acts 21:23, 24

00:11:04.113 --> 00:11:06.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he likely did not anticipate,

00:11:06.816 --> 00:11:08.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there it reads:

00:11:08.351 --> 00:11:10.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So do what we tell you:

00:11:10.353 --> 00:11:13.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We have four men who have put
themselves under a vow.

00:11:13.689 --> 00:11:16.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Take these men with you and cleanse yourself

00:11:16.058 --> 00:11:17.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
“ceremonially together with them

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and take care of their expenses,

00:11:19.695 --> 00:11:21.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that they may have their heads shaved.

00:11:21.697 --> 00:11:24.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then everyone will know that there is nothing

00:11:24.066 --> 00:11:26.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to the rumors they were told about you,

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:28.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but that you are walking orderly

00:11:28.437 --> 00:11:31.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you are also keeping the Law.”

00:11:31.474 --> 00:11:33.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was this the time
for Paul to question

00:11:33.743 --> 00:11:36.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
their decision
or demand his rights?

00:11:36.712 --> 00:11:38.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
He could have reasoned:

00:11:38.714 --> 00:11:40.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Didn’t you read my letter
to the Galatians,

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:44.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘where it says the Law was nailed
to the torture stake with Jesus?

00:11:44.387 --> 00:11:46.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I did nothing wrong!

00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:48.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why do I have to put on
this pretense

00:11:48.724 --> 00:11:50.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
just because a few
are overly sensitive?’

00:11:51.694 --> 00:11:52.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:55.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
He humbly did
as they requested,

00:11:55.164 --> 00:11:58.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
although it
nearly cost him his life.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, it meant swallowing his pride,

00:12:00.569 --> 00:12:02.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Paul knew
there were bigger issues

00:12:02.705 --> 00:12:05.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
involved than his personal rights.

00:12:05.174 --> 00:12:08.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was considerate
of the consciences of others.

00:12:08.844 --> 00:12:10.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
But more importantly,

00:12:10.846 --> 00:12:15.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
he showed his loyalty to Jehovah
and to the governing body.

00:12:15.684 --> 00:12:19.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we see
the bigger issue in our life?

00:12:19.422 --> 00:12:22.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us be determined
to be humble,

00:12:22.258 --> 00:12:25.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
flexible,
and obedient like Paul,

00:12:25.428 --> 00:12:28.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thereby
prove ourselves faithful

00:12:28.531 --> 00:12:31.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “the faithful and discreet slave.”

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:33.936 line:10% position:50% align:center
Third,

00:12:33.936 --> 00:12:35.571 line:10% position:50% align:center
we can be loyal to Jehovah

00:12:35.571 --> 00:12:37.640 line:10% position:50% align:center
by being loyal to the elders.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.041 line:10% position:50% align:center
We’ve discussed loyalty

00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:41.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah himself
and to the faithful slave,

00:12:41.944 --> 00:12:44.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
but what about direction
we receive

00:12:44.013 --> 00:12:46.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the elders
in our congregation?

00:12:46.782 --> 00:12:48.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
We listen
to our elders give talks

00:12:48.951 --> 00:12:50.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
and comments
at the meetings each week,

00:12:50.986 --> 00:12:52.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
we work with them
in the ministry,

00:12:52.988 --> 00:12:54.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we associate
with them.

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
This regular contact
gives us more opportunities

00:12:57.893 --> 00:13:01.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see their imperfections
and flaws.

00:13:01.597 --> 00:13:04.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could begin to focus
on their weaknesses,

00:13:04.967 --> 00:13:08.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
weakening our trust
in God’s arrangement.

00:13:08.437 --> 00:13:11.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, if you zoom in

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
on any of our pictures
in our magazines,

00:13:13.375 --> 00:13:16.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
all you’ll see are colored spots or pixels.

00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:18.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when you zoom out,

00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:22.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
you see a beautiful photo or painting.

00:13:22.384 --> 00:13:25.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
Similarly, when looking at our elders,

00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:28.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t zoom in on their imperfections
—the spots of ink—

00:13:28.757 --> 00:13:31.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather, see the big picture.

00:13:32.628 --> 00:13:34.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why, then, is it so important

00:13:34.663 --> 00:13:38.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
to strengthen our loyalty
to our hard-working, loving shepherds?

00:13:38.133 --> 00:13:40.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because these “gifts in men”

00:13:40.169 --> 00:13:43.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
are an expression
of Jehovah’s loyal love

00:13:43.172 --> 00:13:45.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they loyally lead, feed,

00:13:45.941 --> 00:13:48.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
and protect
his precious sheep.

00:13:48.511 --> 00:13:51.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the great tribulation nears,
our survival will depend

00:13:51.881 --> 00:13:54.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
on our readiness
to respond to their direction,

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:57.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they follow
the Governing Body’s direction.

00:13:57.853 --> 00:14:00.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our loyalty is not to men,

00:14:00.289 --> 00:14:02.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
but to Jehovah’s arrangement

00:14:02.291 --> 00:14:05.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
made up of imperfect,
but loyal men.

00:14:05.461 --> 00:14:08.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is a lesson
that Korah, Dathan,

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Abiram refused to learn.

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:14.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this clip from the video
<i>Respect Jehovah’s Authority,</i>

00:14:14.737 --> 00:14:17.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
listen to Korah’s defiant attitude
toward Moses

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
as taken
from Numbers chapter 16.

00:14:21.043 --> 00:14:22.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s Moses.

00:14:28.017 --> 00:14:30.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is enough of you

00:14:30.719 --> 00:14:32.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the whole assembly 

00:14:32.721 --> 00:14:34.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
are all of them holy

00:14:34.757 --> 00:14:36.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah is in their midst.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why, then, should you lift yourselves up

00:14:40.429 --> 00:14:42.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
above the congregation of Jehovah?

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:48.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
Korah and the others 
made great pretenses of loyalty to God,

00:14:48.404 --> 00:14:50.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
but completely ignored the fact

00:14:50.806 --> 00:14:53.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah directly appointed
Moses and Aaron.

00:14:55.477 --> 00:14:58.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who, then,
were they really murmuring against?

00:14:58.681 --> 00:15:02.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice Numbers 26:9:

00:15:02.818 --> 00:15:04.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This Dathan and Abiram

00:15:04.887 --> 00:15:06.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
“were chosen ones of the assembly

00:15:06.922 --> 00:15:08.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who fought against Moses and Aaron

00:15:08.557 --> 00:15:10.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
“along with Korah’s group

00:15:10.259 --> 00:15:14.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they <i>fought against </i> Jehovah.”

00:15:15.297 --> 00:15:19.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
While focusing on the man Moses
and his imperfections,

00:15:19.134 --> 00:15:23.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
they did not really see that it was Jehovah
who was directing the nation.

00:15:23.939 --> 00:15:27.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were actually fighting
against Jehovah.

00:15:27.376 --> 00:15:31.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their disloyalty to God’s appointed men
cost them their lives.

00:15:31.714 --> 00:15:34.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Korah’s sons
made a different choice.

00:15:34.717 --> 00:15:39.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this next clip, notice an attitude
far different from their father’s.

00:15:39.922 --> 00:15:42.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
My father and his companions

00:15:42.291 --> 00:15:45.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
actually rebelled against Jehovah’s authority.

00:15:45.661 --> 00:15:48.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their envy, pride, and ambition led to rebellion,

00:15:48.998 --> 00:15:50.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the end

00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:52.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
they brought dishonor upon themselves.

00:15:52.901 --> 00:15:55.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
My father sought glory,

00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:57.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
but his glory was short-lived.

00:15:57.706 --> 00:15:59.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m glad, though, that my brothers and I

00:15:59.875 --> 00:16:02.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
took the right side of the issue.

00:16:03.145 --> 00:16:05.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
It must have been hard though.

00:16:05.147 --> 00:16:07.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, it was.

00:16:07.383 --> 00:16:08.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that helps us to understand

00:16:08.917 --> 00:16:10.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
how important it is

00:16:10.919 --> 00:16:13.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we do not allow friendships or family

00:16:13.822 --> 00:16:15.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take priority

00:16:15.157 --> 00:16:17.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
over our relationship with Jehovah

00:16:17.226 --> 00:16:19.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our obedience to him.

00:16:19.862 --> 00:16:22.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what Father has always told me.

00:16:22.131 --> 00:16:24.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mmm, yes.

00:16:24.566 --> 00:16:28.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ultimately, successful direction for us humans

00:16:28.037 --> 00:16:30.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
comes from Jehovah.

00:16:30.139 --> 00:16:31.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should completely trust

00:16:31.874 --> 00:16:34.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his choices of appointed ones.

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:35.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see,

00:16:35.878 --> 00:16:38.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
respect for those whom Jehovah has appointed

00:16:38.681 --> 00:16:41.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
shows respect for Jehovah’s authority.

00:16:43.118 --> 00:16:45.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
The loyalty displayed by Korah’s sons

00:16:45.521 --> 00:16:50.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
moved Jehovah to act
in loyalty by sparing their lives.

00:16:50.092 --> 00:16:53.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
What fine examples
for us to imitate!

00:16:53.362 --> 00:16:56.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we never find ourselves
fighting against Jehovah

00:16:56.632 --> 00:16:59.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
by murmuring
or complaining against those

00:16:59.334 --> 00:17:02.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
who he has appointed
to lead his people today.

00:17:02.504 --> 00:17:05.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
To see more
of the good and the bad examples

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:07.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
of loyalty
among the Israelites,

00:17:07.342 --> 00:17:11.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
we encourage you to watch the entire
<i>Respect Jehovah’s Authority </i> video

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
on JW Broadcasting.

00:17:14.183 --> 00:17:18.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
In review, how can we show
our loyalty to Jehovah?

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:22.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, by coming to his defense
as his Witnesses.

00:17:22.524 --> 00:17:25.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, by maintaining our loyal support

00:17:25.561 --> 00:17:27.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
of “the faithful and discreet slave.”

00:17:27.963 --> 00:17:32.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
And third, by loyally following direction
from the appointed elders.

00:17:32.735 --> 00:17:37.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you imitate faithful examples
like the sons of Korah,

00:17:37.072 --> 00:17:39.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
like David, Peter, and Paul,

00:17:39.508 --> 00:17:42.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will prove to be someone
Jehovah views as loyal

00:17:42.911 --> 00:17:46.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
—worthy of receiving
his acts of loyalty forever.

00:17:48.684 --> 00:17:50.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our second point on loyalty

00:17:50.686 --> 00:17:54.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
shows us ways we can follow
the faithful and discreet slave’s direction.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
But have you ever wondered how

00:17:56.492 --> 00:17:59.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body arrives
at important decisions?

00:17:59.194 --> 00:18:01.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this Bethel morning worship,

00:18:01.196 --> 00:18:03.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother David Splane
answers that very question.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.002 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Well, there’ve been so many changes.

00:18:07.002 --> 00:18:09.004 line:10% position:50% align:center
It’s hard to keep up.”

00:18:09.838 --> 00:18:11.406 line:10% position:50% align:center
We hear that a lot.

00:18:11.406 --> 00:18:13.208 line:10% position:50% align:center
And it’s true.

00:18:13.208 --> 00:18:14.943 line:10% position:50% align:center
So the question is,

00:18:14.943 --> 00:18:17.045 line:10% position:50% align:center
How do these changes come about?

00:18:17.913 --> 00:18:21.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does the Governing Body get together
on a Wednesday morning and say,

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:23.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, what will we change
this week?

00:18:23.619 --> 00:18:26.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s throw the brotherhood
off guard a little bit.”

00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:31.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
That would not be
faithful or discreet.

00:18:32.194 --> 00:18:33.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fact is that,

00:18:33.562 --> 00:18:37.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
although changes may seem
to be announced one after another,

00:18:37.232 --> 00:18:40.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
the decision to put
the changes into effect

00:18:40.636 --> 00:18:43.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
is often years in the making.

00:18:44.673 --> 00:18:47.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, one of the first big changes

00:18:47.643 --> 00:18:50.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the current Governing Body
had to grapple with

00:18:50.779 --> 00:18:52.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
had to do with this,

00:18:52.815 --> 00:18:54.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it feasible

00:18:54.817 --> 00:18:57.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have a Branch Committee serving

00:18:57.653 --> 00:18:59.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the United States?

00:18:59.955 --> 00:19:03.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, for years the thought was
that we really couldn’t have

00:19:03.859 --> 00:19:06.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
a Branch Committee
functioning in the United States

00:19:06.094 --> 00:19:08.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the States was host

00:19:08.897 --> 00:19:13.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Governing Body
and the world headquarters.

00:19:13.168 --> 00:19:16.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this was going to be
a big decision,

00:19:16.672 --> 00:19:19.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it wasn’t taken overnight.

00:19:19.741 --> 00:19:21.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
A lot of consultation

00:19:21.743 --> 00:19:25.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
with mature,
experienced brothers was necessary.

00:19:25.747 --> 00:19:28.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
But finally the decision was made,

00:19:28.016 --> 00:19:32.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we believe that decision
has had Jehovah’s rich blessing.

00:19:32.354 --> 00:19:36.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re proud
of our hard-working Branch Committee,

00:19:36.992 --> 00:19:39.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re happy
to have their support.

00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:41.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need their support.

00:19:42.531 --> 00:19:45.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s consider
a couple of other examples.

00:19:45.734 --> 00:19:49.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beginning in the first week
of January 2009,

00:19:49.338 --> 00:19:51.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
the School, Service Meeting,

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:54.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Congregation Book Study
were merged.

00:19:54.209 --> 00:19:56.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now that decision

00:19:56.211 --> 00:20:00.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
was almost ten years
in the making.

00:20:00.015 --> 00:20:04.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
As far back as 1999,
it was being discussed.

00:20:04.753 --> 00:20:09.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, then, why wasn’t the decision
made ten years earlier?

00:20:09.224 --> 00:20:12.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because the Governing Body
wanted to be sure.

00:20:12.094 --> 00:20:14.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will the brothers
have what they need?

00:20:14.096 --> 00:20:17.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will they have
all of the spiritual food they need

00:20:17.099 --> 00:20:19.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we merge the meetings?

00:20:19.701 --> 00:20:21.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now then one Wednesday

00:20:21.303 --> 00:20:23.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
—I think it was
about three-thirty in the afternoon—

00:20:23.472 --> 00:20:25.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’d had a long meeting.

00:20:25.941 --> 00:20:30.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
We received two letters
from large branches.

00:20:30.412 --> 00:20:34.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
And one of the branches said
that they had many large congregations

00:20:34.416 --> 00:20:37.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
with seven or eight book studies,

00:20:37.085 --> 00:20:40.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
but with only one elder
and one ministerial servant.

00:20:40.389 --> 00:20:42.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the elder might conduct
five book studies,

00:20:42.691 --> 00:20:45.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the ministerial servant
might conduct three,

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:48.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then they had all of the parts
on the meetings to prepare.

00:20:48.363 --> 00:20:51.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
So all they were doing with their time
was conducting book studies

00:20:51.934 --> 00:20:54.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
and preparing parts
for the meetings.

00:20:54.803 --> 00:20:56.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was hard! 

00:20:56.838 --> 00:20:59.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the same week we received 
a letter from another branch, 

00:20:59.975 --> 00:21:04.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they explained why the attendance 
at the book study was so low. 

00:21:04.413 --> 00:21:07.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
They explained that the publishers 
loved the meetings

00:21:07.249 --> 00:21:10.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all of the meetings—
including the book study. 

00:21:10.285 --> 00:21:14.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they’re very poor,
and they couldn’t afford the bus fare

00:21:14.923 --> 00:21:19.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
to attend two midweek meetings;
they had to choose.

00:21:19.194 --> 00:21:22.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if they attended
the School and Service Meeting,

00:21:22.197 --> 00:21:25.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
they could get almost two hours
of spiritual direction,

00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:28.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
whereas with the book study,
they would get one.

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:31.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
So most of the time
it was the School

00:21:31.106 --> 00:21:34.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Service Meeting
that won out.

00:21:34.309 --> 00:21:37.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, those two letters

00:21:37.012 --> 00:21:40.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
put a real face
on the situation,

00:21:40.148 --> 00:21:42.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it helped us
to make the decision.

00:21:43.652 --> 00:21:45.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in 2008,

00:21:45.454 --> 00:21:47.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
a public edition
and a study edition

00:21:47.923 --> 00:21:51.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
of <i>The Watchtower</i>
began to be published.

00:21:51.393 --> 00:21:55.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
That decision was
a long time coming.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:58.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
We discussed the possibility off and on,
but we always said,

00:21:58.867 --> 00:22:01.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let’s not be hasty;
let’s wait a little bit.

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:03.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see what Jehovah wants.”

00:22:03.372 --> 00:22:07.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
The main thing was,
What would Jehovah want?

00:22:07.009 --> 00:22:09.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how would we know?

00:22:09.044 --> 00:22:12.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
We decided to make
a sort of fleece test.

00:22:12.881 --> 00:22:15.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so in 2006,

00:22:15.017 --> 00:22:18.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
we began publishing
one <i>Awake! </i> a month,

00:22:18.353 --> 00:22:20.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we kept publishing
two <i>Watchtowers</i>.

00:22:20.489 --> 00:22:24.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that would be three magazines
per month, instead of four.

00:22:24.259 --> 00:22:27.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the rationale was,
“We’ll try it for a year,

00:22:27.229 --> 00:22:29.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and if at the end of a year

00:22:29.231 --> 00:22:31.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
“our magazine placements
have plummeted,

00:22:31.767 --> 00:22:34.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we’ll know that Jehovah
is not backing this arrangement.

00:22:34.569 --> 00:22:38.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can go back to producing
two <i>Awakes! </i> a year.”

00:22:38.507 --> 00:22:40.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what was the result?

00:22:40.509 --> 00:22:42.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the end of the year,

00:22:42.511 --> 00:22:46.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were placing
as many magazines at three per month

00:22:46.281 --> 00:22:50.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we had been placing
at four per month the year before.

00:22:50.685 --> 00:22:52.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that indicated to us

00:22:52.821 --> 00:22:55.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah
was backing the arrangement.

00:22:55.157 --> 00:22:57.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how many
of us have appreciated

00:22:57.159 --> 00:22:59.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
having a study edition
of <i>The Watchtower</i>

00:22:59.361 --> 00:23:01.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
that speaks directly
to the brotherhood

00:23:01.496 --> 00:23:03.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then a public edition
of <i>The Watchtower</i>

00:23:03.932 --> 00:23:06.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can be tailored
a little bit more

00:23:06.368 --> 00:23:08.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the needs of the public.

00:23:09.438 --> 00:23:11.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, before making any decision

00:23:11.706 --> 00:23:13.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
that affects the Kingdom work,

00:23:13.708 --> 00:23:16.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body
has to carefully consider

00:23:16.645 --> 00:23:18.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
the spiritual implications.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
As an example, in 2008,

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:25.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
the decision was made to reduce
the length of public talks

00:23:25.954 --> 00:23:29.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
from 45 minutes to 30 minutes.

00:23:29.691 --> 00:23:32.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well you say, ‘How could
that decision possibly affect

00:23:32.727 --> 00:23:35.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
the spirituality
of the brotherhood?’

00:23:35.897 --> 00:23:40.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you’re serving
in an urban congregation with many elders

00:23:40.168 --> 00:23:43.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
and nearby there are
other urban congregations with many elders,

00:23:43.505 --> 00:23:47.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps you’d have difficulty
in understanding the reasoning.

00:23:47.309 --> 00:23:50.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the Governing Body
has to look at the whole picture.

00:23:50.812 --> 00:23:54.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thousands of our brothers
have served where the need is great,

00:23:54.983 --> 00:23:56.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they’ve learned
a foreign language.

00:23:56.985 --> 00:23:59.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in many, many
of these congregations

00:23:59.287 --> 00:24:01.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
the learners are the elders.

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:03.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of the learners
have told us

00:24:03.725 --> 00:24:06.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
that for every minute
of a public talk,

00:24:06.995 --> 00:24:10.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
it has required one hour
of preparation.

00:24:10.465 --> 00:24:13.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
So can you imagine:
45-minute public talk

00:24:13.835 --> 00:24:16.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
—45 hours for some of them?

00:24:16.304 --> 00:24:20.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the reduction in the length
of the public talks has actually meant

00:24:20.242 --> 00:24:24.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
that these congregations
could have more public talks.

00:24:24.179 --> 00:24:25.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s not all.

00:24:25.747 --> 00:24:28.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are thousands of elders

00:24:28.016 --> 00:24:30.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are serving
in isolated congregations

00:24:30.285 --> 00:24:33.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
that may be 100 miles or more
from the next congregation.

00:24:33.121 --> 00:24:35.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in one congregation
you have one elder,

00:24:35.557 --> 00:24:39.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then 100 miles away you have
another congregation with one elder.

00:24:39.561 --> 00:24:42.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
How many public talks
were those brothers getting

00:24:42.831 --> 00:24:45.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
when there were
45-minute public talks?

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:49.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
The 15-minute reduction
made a difference.

00:24:49.104 --> 00:24:51.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if we take a narrow view

00:24:51.106 --> 00:24:54.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
and think only about our own situation
and our own congregation,

00:24:54.643 --> 00:24:57.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, we can have difficulty
in understanding

00:24:57.812 --> 00:25:00.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
why certain decisions are made.

00:25:00.749 --> 00:25:04.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now the same principles
apply to clarifications in our beliefs.

00:25:04.853 --> 00:25:08.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body loves
to get together and discuss the Bible.

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:11.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when those Bibles
come out on the table

00:25:11.092 --> 00:25:13.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when the brothers
bring their research in

00:25:13.395 --> 00:25:16.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they’re starting to search
the Scriptures and analyze the Scriptures,

00:25:16.498 --> 00:25:18.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
you see the happy smiles
on their faces.

00:25:18.667 --> 00:25:22.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers love
discussing spiritual things.

00:25:23.338 --> 00:25:26.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the clarifications

00:25:26.641 --> 00:25:30.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
are often a long time
in coming into print.

00:25:30.145 --> 00:25:31.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:25:31.646 --> 00:25:34.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because the clarification
on one scripture

00:25:34.115 --> 00:25:36.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
can have
a domino effect on others.

00:25:36.418 --> 00:25:38.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
The clarification
on one scripture

00:25:38.553 --> 00:25:41.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
can have ramifications
on other prophecies,

00:25:41.122 --> 00:25:45.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we have to be absolutely sure
that everything fits.

00:25:45.961 --> 00:25:47.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
So to reiterate,

00:25:47.696 --> 00:25:51.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
although certain changes
may be announced one after another,

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:55.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
these decisions
are thought out very carefully.

00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:58.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here’s an interesting side point:

00:25:58.139 --> 00:26:00.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
The older members
of the Governing Body

00:26:00.442 --> 00:26:02.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Brother Jaracz, Brother Barr—

00:26:02.777 --> 00:26:06.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
were just as interested
in making the adjustments

00:26:06.147 --> 00:26:08.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the younger members were.

00:26:08.683 --> 00:26:11.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were <i>very </i> progressive.

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:16.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
What an insight into the faithful
and discreet slave’s loving concern!

00:26:16.424 --> 00:26:18.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you hear things
the Governing Body does

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:22.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would further motivate you
to support and follow their direction?

00:26:22.163 --> 00:26:25.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps it’s how
they consulted experienced brothers;

00:26:25.333 --> 00:26:29.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
or that they consider our brothers’
varying circumstances worldwide;

00:26:29.571 --> 00:26:33.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
or, most importantly,
how they patiently and prayerfully seek

00:26:33.808 --> 00:26:37.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
to know Jehovah’s will
and look for his blessing on a decision.

00:26:37.679 --> 00:26:40.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Millions of our brothers
and sisters around the world

00:26:40.315 --> 00:26:42.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
can recount
the blessings they’ve gained

00:26:42.317 --> 00:26:45.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
by remaining loyal
to Jehovah and his organization.

00:26:45.987 --> 00:26:50.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re privileged to have
two such examples here with us today:

00:26:50.458 --> 00:26:53.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother and Sister
William and Sandra Malenfant.

00:26:53.762 --> 00:26:56.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Malenfant is a helper
to the Teaching Committee,

00:26:56.631 --> 00:27:00.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Sister Malenfant’s current assignment
is in the Service Department.

00:27:00.235 --> 00:27:02.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re looking forward to hearing

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:05.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
about their rich spiritual history.

00:27:05.573 --> 00:27:07.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, Bill and Sandra,
we’re so happy

00:27:07.676 --> 00:27:09.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we could have you
here in the studio with us,

00:27:09.844 --> 00:27:12.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we do look forward
to learning more about you.

00:27:12.547 --> 00:27:14.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe we would like to go back.

00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:17.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did you get
on the road that has led you

00:27:17.185 --> 00:27:20.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
to so many years of faithful,
loyal service to Jehovah?

00:27:20.922 --> 00:27:23.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was back in 1954.

00:27:23.758 --> 00:27:27.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mother had contact on and off
with the Witnesses for years.

00:27:27.529 --> 00:27:29.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was about 20 years old,

00:27:29.564 --> 00:27:32.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she was invited
to a public talk

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the Oakland Central Congregation
in California.

00:27:34.736 --> 00:27:37.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
She asked me,
“Would you accompany me?”

00:27:37.038 --> 00:27:40.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I said: “Yeah.
Sure, I’ll be happy to go.”

00:27:40.075 --> 00:27:44.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I recognized a young man
I knew from high school at the meeting,

00:27:44.379 --> 00:27:48.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he approached me after
and told me I needed a Bible study.

00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:51.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really didn’t want a Bible study,
but he insisted,

00:27:51.486 --> 00:27:53.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so I said,
“Well, you can come by.”

00:27:53.588 --> 00:27:54.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you believe it?

00:27:54.856 --> 00:27:58.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started a Bible study
in the <i>“Let God Be True” </i> book.

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:01.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
Four months later,
I was baptized.

00:28:01.162 --> 00:28:04.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was exactly what I was looking for,
but I didn’t realize it.

00:28:04.999 --> 00:28:06.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good choice.
Thank you.

00:28:06.167 --> 00:28:08.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, Sandra, your start on the road

00:28:08.236 --> 00:28:10.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a career serving Jehovah?

00:28:10.605 --> 00:28:14.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before I was born, my parents
started on this search for the truth.

00:28:14.609 --> 00:28:18.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
It happened because they
had lost a little girl in death,

00:28:18.179 --> 00:28:22.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they went from church to church
looking for some kind of comfort.

00:28:22.183 --> 00:28:24.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, of course, the clergy
had no comfort for them.

00:28:24.686 --> 00:28:28.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
They just said, “Well, God wanted
another angel in heaven.”

00:28:28.923 --> 00:28:31.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that angered my father.
He thought: ‘No.

00:28:31.726 --> 00:28:33.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘If God wants another angel,
he can make one.

00:28:33.828 --> 00:28:35.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wouldn’t take my little girl!’

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:37.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it just happened

00:28:37.832 --> 00:28:41.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
that one evening
they were listening to the radio

00:28:41.102 --> 00:28:43.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
—long before TV, of course—

00:28:43.104 --> 00:28:47.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they heard
a Jehovah’s Witness give a talk.

00:28:47.208 --> 00:28:50.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the title of that talk was
“Where Are the Dead?”

00:28:50.445 --> 00:28:51.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine!

00:28:51.713 --> 00:28:54.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave all the Scriptural proof
about the condition of the dead

00:28:54.482 --> 00:28:56.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the hope for the resurrection.

00:28:56.818 --> 00:29:00.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
And my father immediately said,
“This is the truth!”

00:29:00.655 --> 00:29:03.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they wrote
to the radio station;

00:29:03.992 --> 00:29:06.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
got a copy
of the booklet of the talk;

00:29:06.661 --> 00:29:09.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then, also,
they started receiving

00:29:09.831 --> 00:29:12.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
the subscription
to <i>The Watchtower.</i>

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it wasn’t until I was born
and three years old

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:18.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Witnesses
finally made contact with us.

00:29:18.072 --> 00:29:20.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what motivated you
to make a choice

00:29:20.875 --> 00:29:24.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get into the full-time service
and give your life to Jehovah?

00:29:24.512 --> 00:29:26.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what motivated me

00:29:26.848 --> 00:29:30.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
was when I attended
a convention, also in ’56.

00:29:30.351 --> 00:29:32.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
I got baptized in ’54.

00:29:32.654 --> 00:29:36.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in ’56, I went to a district convention
in Albany, California,

00:29:36.758 --> 00:29:38.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there was a pioneer booth.

00:29:38.626 --> 00:29:41.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I approached the booth,
and an older sister there looked at me

00:29:41.963 --> 00:29:43.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
and said:
“You’re young and strong.

00:29:43.965 --> 00:29:45.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why aren’t you a pioneer?”

00:29:45.967 --> 00:29:48.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt, ‘Well, yes.
Why not?’

00:29:48.736 --> 00:29:51.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I started
pioneering in 1956.

00:29:51.306 --> 00:29:52.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what motivated me.

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I was—
Really, I look back at that;

00:29:54.642 --> 00:29:57.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was one of the best decisions
I made in my life.

00:29:57.579 --> 00:29:59.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sandra, how about you?

00:29:59.347 --> 00:30:01.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
Motivated to get
into full-time service.

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:05.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, for pioneer service, you know,
it was—it was like a given.

00:30:05.653 --> 00:30:08.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
Young people were
just encouraged to pioneer.

00:30:08.356 --> 00:30:11.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
And most of the young people
were doing that.

00:30:11.092 --> 00:30:14.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, after a year or two, maybe they
would get married and start a family.

00:30:14.562 --> 00:30:18.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
But those years in pioneering
—starting out their life that way—

00:30:18.166 --> 00:30:22.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
gave them a wonderful basis
for loyal service the rest of their life.

00:30:22.904 --> 00:30:24.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beautiful.

00:30:24.572 --> 00:30:26.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you were pioneering.

00:30:26.241 --> 00:30:28.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did your paths eventually meet?

00:30:28.776 --> 00:30:30.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was at a circuit assembly

00:30:30.845 --> 00:30:35.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Oakland, California, 1956.

00:30:35.083 --> 00:30:37.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very interesting things took place.

00:30:37.352 --> 00:30:40.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had the job
of dismantling the stage.

00:30:40.788 --> 00:30:44.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I was carrying
this large piece of plywood off the stage,

00:30:44.092 --> 00:30:46.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I ran right into Sandra
and knocked her flat!

00:30:46.928 --> 00:30:49.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I took advantage
of the opportunity.

00:30:49.297 --> 00:30:52.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought, ‘Well, that’s not
the best way to introduce yourself.’

00:30:52.667 --> 00:30:55.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I said, “By the way,
would you like to accompany me

00:30:55.803 --> 00:30:57.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a get-together
some of the friends are having?”

00:30:57.972 --> 00:30:59.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very good, Bill.

00:30:59.107 --> 00:31:00.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, yes,
and I followed through on it.

00:31:00.842 --> 00:31:02.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had a lot
of association,

00:31:02.844 --> 00:31:05.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
and after a number of months,
we got married.

00:31:05.179 --> 00:31:07.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
And both of us
were pioneering

00:31:07.248 --> 00:31:09.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
—very happy in our ministry
serving Jehovah.

00:31:09.784 --> 00:31:12.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
You really swept her off her feet.
Literally.

00:31:12.287 --> 00:31:13.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
I fell for him.

00:31:13.121 --> 00:31:14.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very good.

00:31:14.188 --> 00:31:15.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, shortly after you were married,

00:31:15.823 --> 00:31:18.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
I understand
that you received some direction.

00:31:18.693 --> 00:31:22.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, the circuit overseer
visited our congregation.

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:25.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were only married about a month,
I think, when he came through.

00:31:25.266 --> 00:31:29.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he told us that the organization
was looking for pioneers

00:31:29.737 --> 00:31:32.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
who’d be willing to serve
as special pioneers and go wherever,

00:31:32.774 --> 00:31:35.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
where the need was great
in the United States particularly.

00:31:35.977 --> 00:31:39.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we told him:
“Sure. We’d be delighted to do it.”

00:31:39.547 --> 00:31:42.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
And four months
after our marriage,

00:31:42.116 --> 00:31:45.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
we received an assignment
as special pioneers to Decorah, Iowa.

00:31:46.988 --> 00:31:49.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that was a very interesting place

00:31:49.557 --> 00:31:52.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
because there were
only eight publishers in the congregation.

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we arrived

00:31:54.629 --> 00:31:57.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
and started with the meetings there
at the Kingdom Hall.

00:31:57.165 --> 00:32:00.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the Kingdom Hall was up
above Hunt’s Variety Store

00:32:00.001 --> 00:32:03.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
in downtown Decorah,
and we lived in a room behind it.

00:32:03.905 --> 00:32:05.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you know, 
you’re on your own like that

00:32:05.974 --> 00:32:07.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not a lot of brothers around—

00:32:07.976 --> 00:32:10.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
so you look
for encouragement and company.

00:32:10.111 --> 00:32:13.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we would travel down
to Strawberry Point, Iowa,

00:32:13.581 --> 00:32:16.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
to where
Charles and Shirley Sinutko lived

00:32:16.951 --> 00:32:19.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a log cabin
—one-room log cabin.

00:32:19.854 --> 00:32:23.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’d go visit with them in order
to have some mutual encouragement.

00:32:23.925 --> 00:32:26.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a nice picture of you
in that log cabin too

00:32:26.127 --> 00:32:28.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you were
special pioneering.

00:32:28.129 --> 00:32:29.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you’re busy
in that work.

00:32:29.664 --> 00:32:32.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
What special invitation
did you receive?

00:32:32.333 --> 00:32:35.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we received
the invitation to attend Gilead

00:32:35.737 --> 00:32:38.439 line:10% position:50% align:center
—the 34th class of Gilead School—

00:32:38.439 --> 00:32:40.575 line:10% position:50% align:center
and that was a wonderful thing

00:32:40.575 --> 00:32:42.343 line:10% position:50% align:center
after two and half years of pioneering,

00:32:42.343 --> 00:32:44.345 line:10% position:50% align:center
special pioneering in Iowa.

00:32:44.345 --> 00:32:46.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we were assigned
to Lebanon,

00:32:46.447 --> 00:32:50.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we were unable to enter Lebanon
because we couldn’t get the visa.

00:32:50.652 --> 00:32:52.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, the organization asked us,

00:32:52.787 --> 00:32:55.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, will you take
an assignment to Morocco?”

00:32:55.189 --> 00:32:56.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were ready to go anywhere.

00:32:56.724 --> 00:32:59.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s how we took
a boat from New York City

00:32:59.527 --> 00:33:02.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
—five days across the Atlantic—
to Casablanca.

00:33:02.897 --> 00:33:03.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very nice.

00:33:03.898 --> 00:33:07.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what was it like to be
in the missionary service in Morocco?

00:33:07.568 --> 00:33:09.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was very interesting.

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:10.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
We really enjoyed it.

00:33:10.571 --> 00:33:12.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, you know, we only spoke English.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in Morocco,
we had to learn French.

00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:19.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the first month
of our missionary service in Morocco,

00:33:19.781 --> 00:33:24.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
for 30 days we studied
the language 11 hours a day.

00:33:24.318 --> 00:33:27.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that could get pretty tiring
for 11 hours a day,

00:33:27.121 --> 00:33:30.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we’d go to the French movies
and count that as language time.

00:33:30.725 --> 00:33:33.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then, we were moved
to Tangier.

00:33:33.094 --> 00:33:35.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there was
a Spanish congregation in Tangier,

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:38.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we had to learn
the Spanish language too.

00:33:38.433 --> 00:33:41.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that was really a rich blessing

00:33:41.169 --> 00:33:43.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the two of us
to be exposed to that culture

00:33:43.905 --> 00:33:46.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to have
that privilege of serving there.

00:33:46.407 --> 00:33:51.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
So after four years, I understand
that you came back to visit your family. 

00:33:51.145 --> 00:33:54.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
What events
were challenging thereafter?

00:33:54.215 --> 00:33:56.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think Sandra can relate that.

00:33:56.684 --> 00:33:59.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it was usually permitted

00:33:59.487 --> 00:34:01.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
that after you were
in your assignment four years,

00:34:01.489 --> 00:34:03.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
then you were allowed
to come home

00:34:03.024 --> 00:34:05.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
and at least have a vacation
and visit your family.

00:34:05.593 --> 00:34:06.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we got back.

00:34:06.594 --> 00:34:10.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
We visited our family,
and while there,

00:34:10.732 --> 00:34:15.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a medical examination and found out 
that I had a serious health problem. 

00:34:15.103 --> 00:34:17.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, we didn’t have 
the funds to cover that. 

00:34:17.338 --> 00:34:21.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Bill wrote to the Society,
and we made arrangements.

00:34:21.209 --> 00:34:24.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
They said,
“Well, just take care of your situation,

00:34:24.045 --> 00:34:26.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let us know when you’re free.” 

00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:29.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he got a job
to take care

00:34:29.016 --> 00:34:32.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our medical needs
as well as living conditions.

00:34:32.453 --> 00:34:35.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you know,
we just felt like we were failures.

00:34:35.923 --> 00:34:37.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah knew
we were discouraged.

00:34:37.725 --> 00:34:40.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew we felt
distraught about this.

00:34:40.128 --> 00:34:43.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he knew just what we needed,
and he gave it to us.

00:34:43.698 --> 00:34:45.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
As I got to feeling better

00:34:45.767 --> 00:34:49.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we got more free
in our use of time,

00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:51.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
we started pioneering.

00:34:51.472 --> 00:34:55.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah blessed
our ministry just incredibly.

00:34:55.443 --> 00:35:00.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were times,
in this supposedly “unproductive territory”

00:35:00.448 --> 00:35:03.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we had up to 25 people
attending the meetings.

00:35:03.551 --> 00:35:07.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of them got baptized,
and they’re our fast friends to this day.

00:35:07.321 --> 00:35:08.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s incredible!

00:35:08.156 --> 00:35:11.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah knows what you need,
and he provides it.

00:35:11.459 --> 00:35:13.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is beautiful!

00:35:13.461 --> 00:35:15.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
What temptation
did you have to resist

00:35:15.763 --> 00:35:18.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you came back
and were going through these difficulties?

00:35:18.566 --> 00:35:21.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I think it’s
a temptation that confronts

00:35:21.769 --> 00:35:26.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
a lot of brothers and sisters
who return because of health reasons,

00:35:26.574 --> 00:35:30.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
and some just end up settling down
because of their circumstances.

00:35:30.711 --> 00:35:33.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the temptation there was:
‘Well, you’re home.

00:35:33.347 --> 00:35:36.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You’ve already done your service
in Morocco for a number of years.

00:35:36.884 --> 00:35:38.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You’ve been
in the full-time ministry.

00:35:38.452 --> 00:35:41.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just settle down now.
Buy a house.’

00:35:41.389 --> 00:35:44.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
But really,
that wasn’t our desire.

00:35:44.158 --> 00:35:46.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as soon as Sandra
got on her feet

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:48.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
and was feeling well enough,
we got pioneering.

00:35:48.896 --> 00:35:51.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then I wrote headquarters,
and I said: ‘Here we are.

00:35:51.365 --> 00:35:53.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘We’re ready to take on whatever.

00:35:53.367 --> 00:35:54.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would you like us to do?’

00:35:54.969 --> 00:35:56.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good example.
Thank you.

00:35:56.604 --> 00:35:59.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you made yourself
available to the organization.

00:35:59.407 --> 00:36:01.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where did they send you next?

00:36:01.409 --> 00:36:02.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
A wonderful assignment.

00:36:02.877 --> 00:36:06.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were sent
as special pioneers to Washington D.C.,

00:36:06.814 --> 00:36:11.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help start
a Spanish congregation.

00:36:11.152 --> 00:36:14.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that was indeed
a very rich blessing.

00:36:14.622 --> 00:36:16.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were there
a year and a half

00:36:16.991 --> 00:36:21.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
until that little congregation
was solid and was formed.

00:36:21.128 --> 00:36:23.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we received
another blessing.

00:36:23.397 --> 00:36:25.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were appointed
to the circuit work.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I had the Spanish circuit in Florida

00:36:28.636 --> 00:36:32.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Key West to Orlando
—one circuit in the whole state.

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:36.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we came to New York City
—lived in the Bronx.

00:36:36.344 --> 00:36:39.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a circuit, and we did
district work in the Spanish field.

00:36:39.647 --> 00:36:41.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, to Texas

00:36:41.649 --> 00:36:44.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to what they call the Valley of Texas,
the Rio Grande Valley—

00:36:44.585 --> 00:36:46.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a couple of years in the circuit.

00:36:46.587 --> 00:36:49.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then the district in Spanish

00:36:49.156 --> 00:36:52.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Houston, Texas,
to Yuba City, California.

00:36:52.293 --> 00:36:53.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we loved
every minute of it.

00:36:53.794 --> 00:36:56.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s definitely
the traveling work.

00:36:56.330 --> 00:37:00.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then 1977 rolls around
and you receive another invitation.

00:37:00.268 --> 00:37:01.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, indeed!

00:37:01.369 --> 00:37:03.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were doing
preconvention work

00:37:03.604 --> 00:37:06.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the L.A. area
at the Leimert Assembly Hall,

00:37:06.908 --> 00:37:11.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we received a letter
inviting us to come to Bethel.

00:37:11.245 --> 00:37:16.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was a very, very special privilege:
to be invited to Bethel.

00:37:16.217 --> 00:37:18.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
I went into the Service Department,

00:37:18.219 --> 00:37:21.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
because at that time they
invited a number of traveling overseers

00:37:21.055 --> 00:37:23.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
to come in and work
in the Service Department,

00:37:23.491 --> 00:37:25.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Sandra went
into housekeeping.

00:37:25.826 --> 00:37:28.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we were both
delighted to come to Bethel.

00:37:28.562 --> 00:37:30.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, sort of.

00:37:30.898 --> 00:37:34.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really loved the ministry;

00:37:34.168 --> 00:37:36.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
I loved, especially, the district work

00:37:36.671 --> 00:37:38.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
—being with the circuit overseer and his wife

00:37:38.673 --> 00:37:41.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
 every week and out in service.

00:37:41.108 --> 00:37:45.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I wasn’t too anxious
for this Bethel thing.

00:37:45.346 --> 00:37:49.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, you know.
Jehovah, again, knows what you need.

00:37:49.216 --> 00:37:53.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
We came here, and we
started adjusting to Bethel life.

00:37:53.354 --> 00:37:56.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it really proved out
to be a real blessing

00:37:56.657 --> 00:37:59.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we got
the close association

00:37:59.694 --> 00:38:03.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
with so many
other loyal Witnesses of Jehovah.

00:38:03.764 --> 00:38:06.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I’m sure you
have many more experiences

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:09.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
to let us know about,
but we appreciate you sharing those.

00:38:09.737 --> 00:38:13.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body
has made significant adjustments

00:38:13.541 --> 00:38:17.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the work that is taking place
at Bethel and the field,

00:38:17.812 --> 00:38:21.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it has affected
many long-time faithful brothers

00:38:21.048 --> 00:38:23.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
—loyal brothers
in the traveling work,

00:38:23.551 --> 00:38:27.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
overseers in the congregation,
overseers at Bethel.

00:38:27.488 --> 00:38:31.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bill, what do you think
about some of these changes

00:38:31.425 --> 00:38:33.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Governing Body
has made recently?

00:38:33.427 --> 00:38:35.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think they’re
very wise decisions.

00:38:35.496 --> 00:38:37.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
They know what is needed;

00:38:37.665 --> 00:38:40.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
they appreciate the older men
who have served for years.

00:38:40.568 --> 00:38:44.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that the older brothers
in circuit work, district work,

00:38:44.505 --> 00:38:47.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
wherever, they’re “worthy of double honor”
because of the way

00:38:47.942 --> 00:38:50.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’ve given
of themselves to the work.

00:38:50.311 --> 00:38:53.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we have to recognize, too,
there comes a time

00:38:53.314 --> 00:38:56.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we want the younger men
to come along,

00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:58.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
to accept responsibility.

00:38:58.552 --> 00:39:00.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, really,
when we were young,

00:39:00.755 --> 00:39:05.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
we received responsibilities
with very little background and training.

00:39:05.526 --> 00:39:08.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we’ve got all these schools
for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:39:08.929 --> 00:39:11.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Kingdom Ministry School.

00:39:11.332 --> 00:39:14.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
So many opportunities
for younger ones to be trained.

00:39:14.668 --> 00:39:17.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so I think
it’s a wonderful arrangement.

00:39:17.738 --> 00:39:20.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many thousands of young men
are doing so well,

00:39:20.941 --> 00:39:22.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
ready to accept responsibility.

00:39:22.943 --> 00:39:25.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a blessing
for the entire organization.

00:39:25.413 --> 00:39:27.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, thank you for sharing that.

00:39:27.081 --> 00:39:29.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’ll benefit many brothers.

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:31.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we look
at this couple before us,

00:39:31.685 --> 00:39:35.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we see some who have made
wise choices along the way.

00:39:35.523 --> 00:39:39.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we look back at over 60 years
of faithful, loyal service.

00:39:39.226 --> 00:39:41.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you look back at decisions

00:39:41.228 --> 00:39:44.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
you made in life, any regrets?

00:39:45.066 --> 00:39:47.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, absolutely none!

00:39:47.068 --> 00:39:49.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
We consider that whatever

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:54.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have given up or done
it’s been our gift to Jehovah.

00:39:54.575 --> 00:39:58.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, when I was a little girl,
I remember I used to go out on our farm

00:39:58.079 --> 00:40:02.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, especially when there
was a full moon, I used to pray to Jehovah.

00:40:02.483 --> 00:40:04.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’d say,

00:40:04.485 --> 00:40:08.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Just let me use up my life in your service.”

00:40:08.355 --> 00:40:12.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, he’s answered
that prayer because my life,

00:40:12.026 --> 00:40:15.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
the majority of it, is used up
and he’s let me do it in his service.

00:40:15.529 --> 00:40:16.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beautiful.

00:40:16.564 --> 00:40:20.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bill, how do you view sacrifices
that you have made along the way?

00:40:20.201 --> 00:40:22.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as you know, a sacrifice

00:40:22.203 --> 00:40:25.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be something
you give up to serve God, perhaps.

00:40:25.739 --> 00:40:29.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or a sacrifice can be
what you give to Jehovah,

00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:31.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
like David said in Psalm 54.

00:40:31.112 --> 00:40:33.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will sacrifice to you willingly.”

00:40:33.347 --> 00:40:36.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s how I view sacrifice.

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:40.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re happy to give of ourselves
to Jehovah God—to serve him.

00:40:40.454 --> 00:40:43.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I want to add, too, Sandra has been

00:40:43.124 --> 00:40:46.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
a wonderful partner with me
—willing to go anywhere,

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:49.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
put up with all kinds
of circumstances and difficulties.

00:40:49.497 --> 00:40:51.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
A scripture that I—
There are a number

00:40:51.866 --> 00:40:54.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
of good Scriptures,
obviously, that we all love.

00:40:54.034 --> 00:40:56.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
But one in particular
that stays in my mind

00:40:56.670 --> 00:41:00.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
is Romans 14:7,8:

00:41:00.307 --> 00:41:03.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘We live, we live to Jehovah.

00:41:03.377 --> 00:41:06.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘We die, we die to Jehovah.

00:41:06.647 --> 00:41:10.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
So whether we live or we die,
we belong to Jehovah.’

00:41:10.117 --> 00:41:13.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ve made that decision,
not just because he’s the Creator.

00:41:13.654 --> 00:41:18.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve made the decision
to give ourselves to Jehovah God.

00:41:18.125 --> 00:41:21.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, absolutely,
we’ve had the best life possible.

00:41:21.929 --> 00:41:25.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have no regrets at all

00:41:25.366 --> 00:41:27.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what we’ve done with our life,

00:41:27.601 --> 00:41:30.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
giving Jehovah the first place.

00:41:30.437 --> 00:41:32.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bill and Sandra,
it’s been a real privilege

00:41:32.439 --> 00:41:35.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
to hear more about you, and I know
there are more stories to tell.

00:41:35.543 --> 00:41:39.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can you boil down 60-plus years
of loyal service to Jehovah?

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you have given us great insights.

00:41:41.682 --> 00:41:44.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for sharing those gems with us.

00:41:44.685 --> 00:41:49.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like the Malenfants, many loyal Witnesses
were not taught the truth

00:41:49.223 --> 00:41:52.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the Bible from birth to adulthood.

00:41:52.026 --> 00:41:56.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
For some young ones,
seeds of truth are planted along the way

00:41:56.197 --> 00:42:00.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
but can lay dormant
for years due to family circumstances.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sister Cory Wells explains
how her family’s special talent

00:42:03.904 --> 00:42:08.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
almost kept her
from riding on the road to life.

00:42:12.313 --> 00:42:15.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first rodeo I performed in front
of an audience, I was eight years old.

00:42:24.658 --> 00:42:28.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were considered
one of the top two acts in rodeo.

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:33.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
My strength lay in my fearlessness.

00:42:38.772 --> 00:42:43.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though there was
a certain amount of excitement

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:47.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it was fun to travel,
to be together as a family—

00:42:48.849 --> 00:42:51.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was empty.

00:42:55.189 --> 00:42:58.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trick riding is like gymnastics
on the back of a running horse.

00:42:58.826 --> 00:43:01.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve had horses all of our lives.

00:43:01.795 --> 00:43:05.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
My father specialized in training horses.

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:09.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
He used to send us to the mountains,

00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:11.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
riding all day long.

00:43:12.706 --> 00:43:14.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we’d come home
in the evening,

00:43:14.875 --> 00:43:17.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we would start trick riding.

00:43:17.811 --> 00:43:20.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
The way we learned was by a book.

00:43:20.547 --> 00:43:23.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
We looked at stick pictures
that showed how it should be done,

00:43:23.951 --> 00:43:26.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so it was trial and error.

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:29.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the same time that we were learning,
our horses were learning.

00:43:30.491 --> 00:43:33.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
The horse that I rode
just let me do anything.

00:43:34.995 --> 00:43:36.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
My horse’s name was Sweet Lips.

00:43:36.997 --> 00:43:40.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was eight when I got him,
and I named him myself.

00:43:40.367 --> 00:43:44.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was like my best friend.

00:43:44.138 --> 00:43:47.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
My parents were very active
in the rodeo as competitors.

00:43:47.908 --> 00:43:49.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mom was barrel racing;

00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:52.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
my father was
a saddle bronc rider.

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:57.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
I grew up
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:43:57.384 --> 00:44:00.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
but when I was very young,
maybe six or seven,

00:44:00.421 --> 00:44:02.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
my father stopped
serving Jehovah.

00:44:02.556 --> 00:44:04.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
To be honest with you,

00:44:04.692 --> 00:44:07.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they announced that
at the Kingdom Hall,

00:44:07.094 --> 00:44:10.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
it really didn’t have
much meaning to me at the time.

00:44:10.264 --> 00:44:12.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t know what it meant.

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:15.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I could see people crying,
and so I cried.

00:44:15.669 --> 00:44:17.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I didn’t really understand it.

00:44:18.639 --> 00:44:22.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really, from that point, our family
was not active as Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:44:24.378 --> 00:44:28.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
I grew up on the road,
traveling rodeo to rodeo

00:44:28.148 --> 00:44:32.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
—from coast to coast
and from the south to the north—

00:44:32.219 --> 00:44:35.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
as far as the roads go.

00:44:35.689 --> 00:44:38.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
The four of us rode initially

00:44:38.192 --> 00:44:41.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Connie; Kelly; myself;
and my brother, Jim.

00:44:41.528 --> 00:44:43.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our family traveled together.

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:46.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
That meant a lot to me. 

00:44:46.033 --> 00:44:50.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
What separated us
from the others at the time

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:53.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the high speed
that we did it at and also 

00:44:53.974 --> 00:44:56.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
the difficulty with the tricks
that we chose to do.

00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:58.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
People were very excited.

00:44:58.712 --> 00:45:02.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would hire us back
at the same place year after year.

00:45:02.583 --> 00:45:05.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
Throughout all that time,

00:45:05.252 --> 00:45:08.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
we did not miss one Memorial.

00:45:08.956 --> 00:45:11.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were always there.
There was something in us.

00:45:11.358 --> 00:45:14.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
We didn’t know it
when we were little,

00:45:14.027 --> 00:45:16.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
but my parents had succeeded

00:45:16.063 --> 00:45:19.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
in planting the truth in our hearts.

00:45:19.233 --> 00:45:22.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
My link to the truth
was my grandmother.

00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:26.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can remember going
to the ranch and visiting her.

00:45:26.173 --> 00:45:30.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was very busy, but one thing
that really sticks in my mind

00:45:30.344 --> 00:45:34.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
is she always studied
—every day.

00:45:34.148 --> 00:45:37.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
She read her Bible.
Her magazines were studied.

00:45:37.951 --> 00:45:42.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I think it just put a seed in there
that later on started to grow.

00:45:44.358 --> 00:45:47.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just felt like
I needed direction.

00:45:47.461 --> 00:45:50.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s like a line
was drawn in the sand.

00:45:50.364 --> 00:45:52.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take one path or the other.

00:45:53.534 --> 00:45:56.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so, ironically,
the first book

00:45:56.103 --> 00:45:58.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I picked up
to read was the Bible.

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the scriptures
that probably

00:46:01.675 --> 00:46:04.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
meant the most to me
was Proverbs 3:5,6:

00:46:06.079 --> 00:46:08.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Trust in Jehovah
with all your heart

00:46:08.248 --> 00:46:10.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and do not lean upon
your own understanding.

00:46:10.751 --> 00:46:12.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In all your ways
take notice of him,

00:46:12.953 --> 00:46:15.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he himself
will make your paths straight.”

00:46:17.057 --> 00:46:19.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
I used to think
about those words

00:46:19.426 --> 00:46:21.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what I would have to do
to live up to them.

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:25.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although we traveled
with the rodeo

00:46:25.299 --> 00:46:27.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
about ten months
out of the year,

00:46:27.334 --> 00:46:29.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
we did go
to the district convention,

00:46:29.336 --> 00:46:32.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the <i>Live Forever </i> book
came out.

00:46:32.406 --> 00:46:35.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there just came a time
when I knew

00:46:35.409 --> 00:46:37.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
I—I needed to make changes.

00:46:38.178 --> 00:46:40.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
A sister started studying with me,

00:46:40.414 --> 00:46:43.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
and as I started reading
the Bible for myself and studying,

00:46:43.817 --> 00:46:46.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
then Jehovah became real.

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
All it took was one or two people,

00:46:48.755 --> 00:46:50.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the whole family followed.

00:46:50.791 --> 00:46:54.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
My father too returned to the truth.

00:46:55.896 --> 00:46:57.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trick riding was our family business.

00:46:57.898 --> 00:47:01.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was our livelihood,
but we had decided that we were done.

00:47:01.602 --> 00:47:03.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were going to stop.

00:47:03.604 --> 00:47:08.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
With that decision would come
giving up everything we knew.

00:47:08.041 --> 00:47:11.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think—I think the most difficult thing

00:47:11.612 --> 00:47:14.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
for me to do was to sell the horse

00:47:15.382 --> 00:47:19.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
—you just, you just get
such a close bond with them

00:47:19.219 --> 00:47:23.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you’re putting
your life in their hands like that—

00:47:23.223 --> 00:47:25.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I was willing to do that.

00:47:25.459 --> 00:47:26.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just—

00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:29.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew what I wanted to do;
I did it.

00:47:31.565 --> 00:47:34.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
I got baptized in October of ʼ85.

00:47:36.036 --> 00:47:39.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our last performance
was in February of ʼ86.

00:47:39.039 --> 00:47:41.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just finished out our contracts. 

00:47:41.041 --> 00:47:44.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started pioneering
in September of ʼ86,

00:47:44.478 --> 00:47:46.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I’ve never stopped.

00:47:46.914 --> 00:47:49.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also married a man
who loves Jehovah.

00:47:49.983 --> 00:47:52.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve had
the privilege of working

00:47:52.019 --> 00:47:54.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
on international construction projects.

00:47:54.021 --> 00:47:56.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
We went to Mexico.

00:47:56.023 --> 00:47:58.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
We went to Venezuela.

00:47:58.058 --> 00:47:59.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
My father is an elder.

00:47:59.459 --> 00:48:01.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mom is pioneering.

00:48:01.028 --> 00:48:04.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, all of my siblings have been able

00:48:04.231 --> 00:48:07.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
to regular pioneer
at some point in their lives.

00:48:07.267 --> 00:48:09.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re presently in the circuit work.

00:48:09.937 --> 00:48:13.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Serving Jehovah together is such a blessing.

00:48:13.373 --> 00:48:18.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything that we do
every day is for Jehovah.

00:48:19.179 --> 00:48:21.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what I wanted to do

00:48:21.181 --> 00:48:23.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I made this decision.

00:48:25.552 --> 00:48:29.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
If I would have taken
that other path when I was young,

00:48:29.189 --> 00:48:31.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
I may not be alive today.

00:48:31.925 --> 00:48:34.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
What I did was dangerous.

00:48:34.761 --> 00:48:38.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even fame and fortune in the world
—there’s nothing there.

00:48:38.498 --> 00:48:40.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted “the real life.”

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to serve Jehovah.

00:48:44.605 --> 00:48:47.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have no regrets.

00:48:47.708 --> 00:48:49.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
If I could change anything

00:48:49.776 --> 00:48:52.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it comes
to my service to Jehovah,

00:48:52.279 --> 00:48:54.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would change nothing!

00:48:54.281 --> 00:48:55.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would just do it better.

00:49:00.387 --> 00:49:04.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
It took courage for Cory and her family
to choose loyalty to Jehovah

00:49:04.992 --> 00:49:07.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
over an exciting rodeo career.

00:49:07.027 --> 00:49:10.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will always help us
when we’re prayerfully deciding

00:49:10.297 --> 00:49:12.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
how an activity or a career we love

00:49:12.699 --> 00:49:14.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
affects our dedication to him.

00:49:14.735 --> 00:49:17.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can the time it demands,
or even the danger involved,

00:49:17.971 --> 00:49:20.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
take us away
from whole-souled service?

00:49:20.374 --> 00:49:23.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our loyalty to Jehovah is expressed

00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:25.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
in how we follow Bible principles

00:49:25.112 --> 00:49:27.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
when making
any important decision in life.

00:49:27.948 --> 00:49:31.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
We received a report
from San Francisco, California,

00:49:31.151 --> 00:49:32.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the United States,

00:49:32.519 --> 00:49:36.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
where publishers have been engaged
in special metropolitan witnessing

00:49:36.123 --> 00:49:38.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
since 2013.

00:49:38.325 --> 00:49:41.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s helping our brothers
reach multiple language groups,

00:49:41.561 --> 00:49:45.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
start Bible studies,
and make disciples.

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:02.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I’m rolling the carts down
to get ready for the work,

00:50:02.916 --> 00:50:06.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can feel people’s eyes on me
and it makes me feel proud

00:50:06.653 --> 00:50:09.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I’m representing Jehovah
even before I get to the location.

00:50:10.557 --> 00:50:14.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have a chance
to use our Bibles very regularly.

00:50:14.428 --> 00:50:16.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
We talk to honesthearted people
who are interested

00:50:16.963 --> 00:50:19.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
in really learning
what the Bible teaches.

00:50:22.903 --> 00:50:26.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is reaching people
in those hard-to-reach areas

00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:28.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
where it could mean their life

00:50:28.608 --> 00:50:31.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
to even talk about things
such as the Bible.

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:35.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you’re part
of the metropolitan work,

00:50:35.582 --> 00:50:38.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
you get to welcome people
being drawn by Jehovah.

00:50:43.523 --> 00:50:47.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see thousands of people
every day who walk by our carts.

00:50:50.497 --> 00:50:55.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
While we’re placing literature
in up to 40 different languages each week,

00:50:55.068 --> 00:50:58.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
what’s really exciting is to see
how many conversations we’re starting

00:50:58.038 --> 00:51:00.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how many Bible studies
we’re initiating.

00:51:00.407 --> 00:51:05.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re visible to a lot of people
in the community, 

00:51:05.045 --> 00:51:08.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially those who were inactive
or maybe were raised around the truth.

00:51:11.585 --> 00:51:13.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has arranged
to have his people

00:51:13.787 --> 00:51:16.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
put right in the center
of everything,

00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:19.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re able to meet people
from all over the world.

00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:26.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve met people from Peru, South Africa,

00:51:26.099 --> 00:51:28.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Japan, Germany, England.

00:51:28.502 --> 00:51:31.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
France, Italy,

00:51:31.004 --> 00:51:33.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cameroon, Congo.

00:51:33.507 --> 00:51:35.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beaucoup!

00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:44.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Shona, a greeting
would be something like . . .

00:51:57.364 --> 00:51:59.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . , which means
“Would you like to study the Bible?”

00:52:06.573 --> 00:52:10.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . , which means “Would you like 
to study the Bible?” in sign language.

00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:13.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when I asked her if she had seen
the sign-language Bible,

00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:18.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
she shook her head no,
and I showed her Acts 17:27.

00:52:18.285 --> 00:52:21.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as soon as it was done,
she started signing, “I understood that!”

00:52:21.755 --> 00:52:24.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then she said,
“Didn’t you say this was a free app?”

00:52:24.157 --> 00:52:27.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, right then,
she started downloading it on her phone.

00:52:28.628 --> 00:52:31.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had a gentleman come up
and wanted to . . .

00:52:31.364 --> 00:52:34.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, he said, “debate,”
and then he said, “just discuss.”

00:52:34.134 --> 00:52:37.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as he was talking with us,
he had to catch his train

00:52:37.537 --> 00:52:39.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he missed three trains

00:52:39.573 --> 00:52:42.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he wanted to continue
the conversation and speak with us.

00:52:42.409 --> 00:52:45.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a really good experience
because we just get to talk to people

00:52:45.078 --> 00:52:47.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let them see
a different side of us.

00:52:47.314 --> 00:52:51.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not necessarily about whether
we placed a book with him or not.

00:52:51.051 --> 00:52:53.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in the end, he turned
to my husband and I

00:52:53.787 --> 00:52:56.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
and said, “You know, you’re
really good ambassadors.”

00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:59.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
We start Bible studies
here every day,

00:52:59.726 --> 00:53:02.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
and these studies
are conducted globally.

00:53:04.097 --> 00:53:09.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
I met Alfredo in 2014,
right before the Memorial.

00:53:09.102 --> 00:53:10.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
He approached the cart.

00:53:10.570 --> 00:53:12.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had a rough life.

00:53:12.572 --> 00:53:14.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was doing a lot of bad things,

00:53:14.007 --> 00:53:17.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so he felt
that he couldn’t overcome them.

00:53:17.611 --> 00:53:20.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I told him that no matter
how big his problems are,

00:53:20.814 --> 00:53:22.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re not too big
for Jehovah,

00:53:22.916 --> 00:53:26.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so I encouraged him
to start studying the Bible again.

00:53:28.655 --> 00:53:30.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Come, now,

00:53:30.657 --> 00:53:35.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and let us set matters straight
between us,” says Jehovah.

00:53:35.095 --> 00:53:37.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Though your sins are like scarlet,

00:53:37.898 --> 00:53:40.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
they will be made as white as snow.”

00:53:42.736 --> 00:53:46.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jehovah forgives you,
he forgives you completely.

00:53:47.674 --> 00:53:50.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
I got baptized,
and in the same month,

00:53:50.677 --> 00:53:53.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started auxiliary pioneering.

00:53:53.613 --> 00:53:57.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is such a privilege to be
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:53:57.984 --> 00:54:01.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
with brothers
all around the world.

00:54:04.457 --> 00:54:06.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
If anybody is hesitant
to take part

00:54:06.726 --> 00:54:09.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the special metropolitan
witnessing work,

00:54:09.195 --> 00:54:12.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe you’re worried
about finances, time,

00:54:12.599 --> 00:54:14.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
or you’re just afraid
that it’s something different

00:54:14.801 --> 00:54:16.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you won’t know
what to do,

00:54:16.803 --> 00:54:19.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
please don’t let
any of those things stop you.

00:54:19.372 --> 00:54:21.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s from Jehovah.

00:54:21.374 --> 00:54:25.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
Grab hold of it tight,
and don’t let go!

00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:49.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each month,
the brothers and sisters

00:54:49.602 --> 00:54:52.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
in San Francisco’s metropolitan witnessing

00:54:52.072 --> 00:54:55.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
distribute over 5,000 publications

00:54:55.308 --> 00:54:59.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
and start an average
of 185 Bible studies.

00:54:59.346 --> 00:55:02.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
After some initial concern
from local authorities

00:55:02.282 --> 00:55:05.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
over having literature carts
at the Golden Gate Bridge,

00:55:05.051 --> 00:55:09.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
authorities have expressed appreciation
for our brothers being there

00:55:09.089 --> 00:55:11.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the Bible’s message of hope.

00:55:11.658 --> 00:55:14.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s been requested
that we always have on hand

00:55:14.594 --> 00:55:18.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
the April 2014 <i>Awake!</i><i> </i>
with the cover title

00:55:18.331 --> 00:55:22.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why Go On?
—Three Reasons to Keep Living.”

00:55:22.502 --> 00:55:25.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
One afternoon an officer
approached a cart and said,

00:55:25.605 --> 00:55:27.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, your magazine worked!”

00:55:27.874 --> 00:55:30.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
The police had just helped
a young woman

00:55:30.377 --> 00:55:32.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was thinking
of jumping from the bridge.

00:55:32.979 --> 00:55:37.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
When they reached her,
she had the <i>Awake! </i> issue in her hand

00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:39.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
and had decided not to jump.

00:55:40.653 --> 00:55:44.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
Life in this system
can be difficult for everyone,

00:55:44.591 --> 00:55:47.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
but our witnessing work
comforts people

00:55:47.494 --> 00:55:51.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
and teaches them to know
and thank their Creator for life.

00:55:51.898 --> 00:55:55.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the longer we know Jehovah
as his Witnesses,

00:55:55.301 --> 00:55:59.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
the more reasons we find
to thank him for his acts of loyalty.

00:55:59.706 --> 00:56:03.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re even moved to sing
our appreciation to Jehovah,

00:56:03.443 --> 00:56:08.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
like in this music video entitled
“Our Thanks Go to You.”

00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:42.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I cannot find
Any peace of mind,

00:56:42.649 --> 00:56:53.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will listen.
My thanks go to you.

00:56:53.660 --> 00:57:05.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
When troubles arise,
Whatever the size,

00:57:05.271 --> 00:57:16.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
For your answers,
Our thanks go to you.

00:57:16.583 --> 00:57:27.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need not be anxious
over anything.

00:57:27.794 --> 00:57:34.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll guard our hearts
and our thoughts

00:57:34.667 --> 00:57:41.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we continue having
trust in you to

00:57:41.808 --> 00:57:53.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Give us peace of mind
When life is unkind.

00:57:53.119 --> 00:58:02.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
For our welfare,
Our thanks go to you.

00:58:18.444 --> 00:58:29.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
All the loyal 
find you loyal too.

00:58:29.889 --> 00:58:41.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
For your care, 
all our thanks go to you.

00:58:44.437 --> 00:58:48.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
We saw the family in our music video
facing economic pressure

00:58:48.441 --> 00:58:52.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our dear older couple enduring
the stress of failing health.

00:58:52.312 --> 00:58:55.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as Philippians 4:6 encourages,

00:58:55.048 --> 00:58:58.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
they let their “petitions
be made known to God.”

00:58:58.251 --> 00:59:02.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
You and I can do the same
for any problem that causes us anxiety.

00:59:02.422 --> 00:59:04.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should not only supplicate Jehovah

00:59:04.557 --> 00:59:07.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give us his holy spirit
so that we can endure

00:59:07.293 --> 00:59:09.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also thank him,

00:59:09.362 --> 00:59:12.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
fully assured
that “he will not abandon his loyal ones.”

00:59:13.299 --> 00:59:14.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’d again like to thank

00:59:14.834 --> 00:59:17.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother and Sister Malenfant
for being here with us.

00:59:17.503 --> 00:59:20.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
With almost 60 years
of full-time service,

00:59:20.573 --> 00:59:23.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Malenfants have so much
they can share,

00:59:23.610 --> 00:59:25.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we’re pleased to announce

00:59:25.612 --> 00:59:27.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
that an extended version
of their interview

00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:31.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be released later this month
on JW Broadcasting.

00:59:31.217 --> 00:59:33.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Finally in our program,

00:59:33.319 --> 00:59:36.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have a special behind-the-scenes visit
with the orchestra

00:59:36.356 --> 00:59:39.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
that records
our beautiful theocratic music.

00:59:39.425 --> 00:59:41.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
In December 2015,

00:59:41.894 --> 00:59:45.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
75 musicians gathered
from 16 countries

00:59:45.498 --> 00:59:49.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a five-day session at our studio
in Patterson, New York.

00:59:49.335 --> 00:59:53.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
A team of 15 technicians
joined them to record 22 pieces.

00:59:53.773 --> 00:59:56.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
Among several songs
we sing at our meetings

00:59:56.576 --> 00:59:59.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the stirring arrangement
of song 147,

00:59:59.779 --> 01:00:03.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A Special Possession,”
that we sang at this year’s Memorial.

01:00:13.426 --> 01:00:16.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
The orchestra took time
from their busy session

01:00:16.262 --> 01:00:18.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
to send you
their Christian love and greetings.

01:00:18.931 --> 01:00:22.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we thank them
and the Governing Body

01:00:22.135 --> 01:00:25.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the music we have
to joyfully praise our God, Jehovah.

01:00:26.005 --> 01:00:29.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re happy to have been together
with you for this month’s program.

01:00:29.342 --> 01:00:33.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
From Brooklyn, New York,
this is JW Broadcasting.
