This month, we’re going to discuss the theme

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:06.456 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Pray Continually,

00:00:06.456 --> 00:00:09.793 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So That You May Not Enter Into Temptation.”

00:00:09.793 --> 00:00:11.795 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Those words of Jesus

00:00:11.795 --> 00:00:15.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are recorded at Matthew 26:41.

00:00:15.965 --> 00:00:20.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this discussion,
we’ll answer three important questions:

00:00:21.037 --> 00:00:23.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) Why did Jesus pray?

00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:27.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) What temptations did he face?

00:00:28.912 --> 00:00:33.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and (3) What lessons can we learn
from Jesus’ example?

00:00:33.683 --> 00:00:36.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s start by reading that verse together.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Matthew 26:41:

00:00:41.057 --> 00:00:44.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep on the watch and pray continually,

00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:47.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that you may not enter into temptation.

00:00:47.997 --> 00:00:51.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The spirit, of course,
is eager [or, “willing,” ftn.],

00:00:51.768 --> 00:00:53.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the flesh is weak.”

00:00:54.404 --> 00:00:57.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did Jesus pray?

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus uttered these words

00:00:59.042 --> 00:01:02.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the final night before his execution.

00:01:02.045 --> 00:01:05.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt this was the most difficult evening

00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:08.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus had ever faced.

00:01:08.084 --> 00:01:10.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The surrounding verses tell us

00:01:10.453 --> 00:01:14.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “he began to feel grieved
and to be greatly troubled.”

00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:17.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s hard for us to comprehend fully

00:01:17.794 --> 00:01:22.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the stress and pressure
Jesus was facing on that night.

00:01:22.432 --> 00:01:27.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew that Satan was about to throw
everything he could at him.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus also knew that he’d soon die

00:01:30.406 --> 00:01:33.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an agonizing death.

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:38.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But something else
was even harder for him to handle.

00:01:38.047 --> 00:01:42.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He realized
that he was about to be falsely charged

00:01:42.218 --> 00:01:45.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and convicted of the despicable crime

00:01:45.588 --> 00:01:49.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of blasphemy against Jehovah’s holy name.

00:01:50.827 --> 00:01:55.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The study note on Matthew 26:39 says:

00:01:55.832 --> 00:01:59.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jesus no doubt felt great concern

00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:01.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“over the reproach that his death

00:02:01.571 --> 00:02:04.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as one charged with blasphemy and sedition

00:02:04.808 --> 00:02:06.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“could bring on God,

00:02:06.943 --> 00:02:08.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“moving him to pray

00:02:08.945 --> 00:02:12.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this ‘cup’ pass away from him.”

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:15.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the face of all that pressure,

00:02:15.518 --> 00:02:19.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would Jesus remain faithful until death?

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:23.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The lives of countless people
hung in the balance.

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even more important,

00:02:25.361 --> 00:02:29.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his Father’s reputation was involved.

00:02:29.265 --> 00:02:33.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Under all that intense emotional stress,

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what did Jesus do?

00:02:35.338 --> 00:02:38.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He prayed, not just once,

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:40.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but three times!

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how Luke describes what happened,

00:02:43.313 --> 00:02:48.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded at Luke 22:44:

00:02:48.218 --> 00:02:50.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But he was in such agony

00:02:50.553 --> 00:02:53.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that he kept praying more earnestly;

00:02:53.656 --> 00:02:57.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and his sweat became as drops of blood

00:02:57.026 --> 00:02:59.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
falling to the ground.”

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:01.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the lesson for us?

00:03:01.965 --> 00:03:04.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, think about it.

00:03:04.067 --> 00:03:06.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus knew Satan well.

00:03:06.536 --> 00:03:08.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus had observed from heaven

00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:11.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the temptations that Satan uses

00:03:11.541 --> 00:03:14.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his efforts to ensnare God’s servants.

00:03:14.677 --> 00:03:18.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, Jesus did not feel
that he could easily handle

00:03:18.648 --> 00:03:21.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whatever “the Tempter”
might place before him.

00:03:21.918 --> 00:03:24.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is a clear lesson for us:

00:03:24.687 --> 00:03:26.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the perfect Son of God

00:03:26.923 --> 00:03:30.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
felt the need to pray
for divine help and strength,

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how much more so should we.

00:03:33.563 --> 00:03:37.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How appropriate then is the admonition:

00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:39.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Pray continually,

00:03:39.068 --> 00:03:42.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you may not enter into temptation.”

00:03:43.106 --> 00:03:48.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what does it mean
to “enter into temptation”?

00:03:48.044 --> 00:03:51.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  back in 1951 explained:

00:03:51.781 --> 00:03:55.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We ourselves under Satan’s influence

00:03:55.985 --> 00:04:00.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“create the temptation
by thinking how nice it would be

00:04:00.356 --> 00:04:03.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to do or to have something
contrary to God’s will,

00:04:03.993 --> 00:04:08.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and then not dismissing
the desire created by this improper thinking,

00:04:08.698 --> 00:04:12.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but considering it more and more.

00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:14.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In this way we are drawn out

00:04:14.904 --> 00:04:18.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and led to ignore God’s counsel and warning.

00:04:18.574 --> 00:04:21.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We enter into temptation.”

00:04:23.046 --> 00:04:26.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prayer helps us when we face temptation.

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:30.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helps us to focus
on what Jehovah wants us to do

00:04:30.453 --> 00:04:35.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to ask him for the strength
not to enter into temptation.

00:04:35.224 --> 00:04:36.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our second question:

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What temptations did Jesus face

00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:41.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while here on earth?

00:04:42.098 --> 00:04:47.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We probably immediately think
of the occasion shortly after Jesus’ baptism

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he was tempted three times by the Devil.

00:04:50.106 --> 00:04:54.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s quickly summarize
those three temptations.

00:04:54.444 --> 00:04:59.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, Jesus was asked
to turn stones into bread

00:04:59.048 --> 00:05:02.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at a time when he was extremely hungry.

00:05:02.318 --> 00:05:07.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Basically, Satan appealed
to Jesus’ desire for food.

00:05:07.023 --> 00:05:10.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, Jesus immediately rejected
the temptation

00:05:10.626 --> 00:05:14.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to satisfy that desire
in an inappropriate way.

00:05:16.032 --> 00:05:18.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, Satan challenged Jesus

00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:21.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to throw himself off the temple battlement.

00:05:21.804 --> 00:05:25.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus rejected this temptation as well.

00:05:25.008 --> 00:05:26.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:30.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he knew
that such a spectacular display

00:05:30.613 --> 00:05:35.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would amount
to a prideful testing of Jehovah.

00:05:35.018 --> 00:05:36.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally,

00:05:36.185 --> 00:05:38.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan offered Jesus

00:05:38.287 --> 00:05:42.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“all the kingdoms of the world
and their glory.”

00:05:42.058 --> 00:05:44.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at what price?

00:05:45.194 --> 00:05:48.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan demanded that Jesus offer him in return

00:05:48.197 --> 00:05:50.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an act of worship.

00:05:50.566 --> 00:05:52.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was Jesus’ answer?

00:05:52.735 --> 00:05:57.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He flatly refused, saying: “Go away, Satan!”

00:05:58.875 --> 00:06:01.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you had to face similar temptations?

00:06:01.244 --> 00:06:03.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you might quickly answer:

00:06:03.246 --> 00:06:06.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘No one has asked me
to turn stones into bread

00:06:06.082 --> 00:06:08.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘or to jump off a tall building.

00:06:08.084 --> 00:06:10.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘And certainly no one has offered me

00:06:10.086 --> 00:06:13.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the rulership
of all the governments in the world!’

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:17.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But notice, please, we said “similar,”
not “the same.”

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So have you faced similar temptations?

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt you have.

00:06:22.732 --> 00:06:25.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of us have faced temptations

00:06:25.268 --> 00:06:27.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
involving fleshly desires.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:32.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may have been temptations
to commit immorality

00:06:32.075 --> 00:06:34.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or temptations that appealed to greed

00:06:34.377 --> 00:06:38.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or an unbalanced concern
about material things.

00:06:38.414 --> 00:06:43.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Other temptations may have appealed
to our pride or tested our humility

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:46.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or our desire to impress others.

00:06:48.024 --> 00:06:51.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And who of us hasn’t been tempted
by opportunities

00:06:51.394 --> 00:06:53.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
offered to us by Satan’s world

00:06:53.396 --> 00:06:57.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for wealth, power, or position?

00:06:57.433 --> 00:07:00.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what temptation
comes our way, though,

00:07:00.903 --> 00:07:04.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember Jesus’ words:
“Pray continually,

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:07.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you may not enter into temptation.”

00:07:09.011 --> 00:07:13.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But were those the only temptations
that Jesus faced?

00:07:13.015 --> 00:07:14.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:07:14.383 --> 00:07:15.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we know?

00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:17.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, notice Luke’s words

00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:22.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found at Luke 4:13:

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:27.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So the Devil,
having finished all the temptation,

00:07:27.063 --> 00:07:32.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
departed from him
until another convenient time.”

00:07:32.935 --> 00:07:36.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did Satan ever come back again
to tempt Jesus?

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:39.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He must have because of what we’re told

00:07:39.809 --> 00:07:43.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Hebrews 4:15.

00:07:43.913 --> 00:07:45.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read that:

00:07:45.982 --> 00:07:48.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For we do not have a high priest

00:07:48.851 --> 00:07:52.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses,

00:07:52.088 --> 00:07:54.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but we have one who has been tested

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:57.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in all respects as we have,

00:07:57.927 --> 00:07:59.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but without sin.”

00:08:00.763 --> 00:08:03.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever wondered
what other “convenient time”

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan selected to test Jesus?

00:08:06.702 --> 00:08:09.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s consider some possibilities.

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:13.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One example occurred in 32 C.E.,

00:08:13.142 --> 00:08:18.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about two and a half years
after the initial temptations.

00:08:18.181 --> 00:08:23.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn to John 6:15:

00:08:23.186 --> 00:08:26.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then Jesus, knowing
that they were about to come

00:08:26.189 --> 00:08:28.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and seize him to make him king,

00:08:28.891 --> 00:08:32.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
withdrew again to the mountain all alone.”

00:08:33.129 --> 00:08:36.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This seems like a similar temptation

00:08:36.132 --> 00:08:38.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to what Jesus had already faced.

00:08:38.668 --> 00:08:41.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this time, the setting was different.

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:45.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan didn’t directly offer
the kingship to Jesus.

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:49.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was no demand
for Jesus to worship the Devil.

00:08:49.745 --> 00:08:54.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, those following Jesus
wanted to make him their king.

00:08:54.383 --> 00:08:59.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This temptation was going to be
by popular demand.

00:08:59.021 --> 00:09:01.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did Jesus react?

00:09:01.257 --> 00:09:04.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, even before they could make their move,

00:09:04.093 --> 00:09:08.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus withdrew from them to a mountain,
just by himself.

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:11.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what did he do on the mountain?

00:09:11.901 --> 00:09:14.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We find the answer in a detail

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:18.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
added in the parallel account
recorded by Matthew.

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:21.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read it together.

00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:25.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Matthew 14:23:

00:09:25.514 --> 00:09:28.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“After sending the crowds away,

00:09:28.784 --> 00:09:32.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he went up on the mountain
by himself to pray.”

00:09:33.289 --> 00:09:37.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jesus went there
not just to avoid the crowds

00:09:37.893 --> 00:09:39.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but to pray.

00:09:39.929 --> 00:09:42.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The third question:

00:09:42.098 --> 00:09:43.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What lessons can we learn

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:45.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Jesus’ example?

00:09:46.535 --> 00:09:48.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though we may have passed a test,

00:09:48.771 --> 00:09:52.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or avoided entering into temptation,
in the past,

00:09:52.708 --> 00:09:55.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we shouldn’t be surprised

00:09:55.044 --> 00:09:58.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if a similar temptation may arise again

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in a different form or situation

00:10:01.751 --> 00:10:03.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at a convenient time.

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:05.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For whom?

00:10:05.221 --> 00:10:08.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For Satan, not us.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another occasion occurred
when Jesus and his apostles

00:10:11.894 --> 00:10:14.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were in the vicinity of Mount Hermon,

00:10:14.263 --> 00:10:16.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
near Caesarea Philippi.

00:10:16.899 --> 00:10:19.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus’ apostles had just acknowledged him

00:10:19.902 --> 00:10:23.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “the Christ, the Son of the living God.”

00:10:23.306 --> 00:10:27.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jesus took the opportunity
to expand their thinking further.

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:29.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what’s recorded

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:34.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Matthew 16:21:

00:10:34.317 --> 00:10:36.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“From that time forward,

00:10:36.419 --> 00:10:39.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jesus began explaining to his disciples

00:10:39.655 --> 00:10:41.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that he must go to Jerusalem

00:10:41.824 --> 00:10:43.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and suffer many things

00:10:43.693 --> 00:10:48.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from the elders and chief priests
and scribes and be killed,

00:10:48.564 --> 00:10:52.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and on the third day be raised up.”

00:10:52.935 --> 00:10:56.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was the reaction of his apostles
to this information?

00:10:56.806 --> 00:10:59.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read on in verse 22:

00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:02.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At this Peter took him aside

00:11:02.578 --> 00:11:04.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and began to rebuke him, saying:

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Be kind to yourself, Lord;

00:11:07.249 --> 00:11:09.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will not have this happen
to you at all.’”

00:11:10.619 --> 00:11:13.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although these words were uttered
by a close friend,

00:11:13.956 --> 00:11:16.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus immediately recognized

00:11:16.525 --> 00:11:20.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they reflected Satan’s wishes,
not Jehovah’s.

00:11:20.463 --> 00:11:22.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he firmly responded:

00:11:22.798 --> 00:11:24.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Get behind me, Satan!

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are a stumbling block to me,

00:11:27.036 --> 00:11:30.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because you think, not God’s thoughts,

00:11:30.172 --> 00:11:33.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but those of men.”

00:11:33.142 --> 00:11:36.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although this account
doesn’t specifically refer

00:11:36.278 --> 00:11:38.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jesus praying at that time,

00:11:38.748 --> 00:11:42.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know that Jesus was a man of prayer.

00:11:42.418 --> 00:11:45.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul tells us at Hebrews 5:7:

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:48.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“During his life on earth,

00:11:48.224 --> 00:11:52.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Christ offered up
supplications and also petitions,

00:11:52.528 --> 00:11:55.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with strong outcries and tears.”

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:58.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So no doubt those prayers helped Jesus

00:11:58.667 --> 00:12:02.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to focus on the reason why he came to earth.

00:12:02.171 --> 00:12:05.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That clear focus helped him to see

00:12:05.241 --> 00:12:07.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Peter’s misguided counsel

00:12:07.843 --> 00:12:11.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would only help to further
the Tempter’s cause.

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:14.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does this teach us?

00:12:14.417 --> 00:12:18.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This shows us that temptations
don’t always come

00:12:18.187 --> 00:12:21.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from those who are Jehovah’s enemies.

00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:23.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some who are close to us

00:12:23.359 --> 00:12:27.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may even serve Satan’s ends unintentionally,

00:12:27.029 --> 00:12:29.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as was the case with Peter.

00:12:29.498 --> 00:12:33.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could be an employer,
a workmate, a schoolmate,

00:12:33.469 --> 00:12:36.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a friend, a relative, a parent,

00:12:36.705 --> 00:12:39.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a brother, or a marriage mate.

00:12:40.743 --> 00:12:45.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s examine another example
of how Satan returned to Jesus.

00:12:45.314 --> 00:12:49.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time, it was
by means of the religious leaders.

00:12:49.452 --> 00:12:51.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They attacked Jesus verbally,

00:12:51.854 --> 00:12:56.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
misquoting Scripture
and hurling senseless accusations at him.

00:12:56.792 --> 00:13:01.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jesus understood what they were up to
and frankly told them:

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:04.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are from your father the Devil.”

00:13:04.867 --> 00:13:09.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We shouldn’t be surprised
if apostates and other opposers

00:13:09.138 --> 00:13:11.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
use similar tactics today.

00:13:11.774 --> 00:13:15.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as Jesus was accused of blasphemy

00:13:15.044 --> 00:13:17.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and political sedition,

00:13:17.046 --> 00:13:21.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so too God’s people
have been labeled as “extremists”

00:13:21.584 --> 00:13:26.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have been the victims
of all sorts of false accusations.

00:13:26.121 --> 00:13:28.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Jesus, we remember

00:13:28.757 --> 00:13:31.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who really is behind all these attacks

00:13:31.894 --> 00:13:35.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Satan, the great Tempter!

00:13:35.264 --> 00:13:38.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will help us to avoid the temptation

00:13:38.334 --> 00:13:41.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of giving up because of discouragement?

00:13:41.337 --> 00:13:43.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we successfully handle

00:13:43.739 --> 00:13:46.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all these types of attacks?

00:13:46.642 --> 00:13:49.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul tells us what to do.

00:13:50.713 --> 00:13:54.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read at Ephesians 6:11:

00:13:54.917 --> 00:13:58.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Put on the complete suit of armor from God

00:13:58.754 --> 00:14:01.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that you may be able to stand firm

00:14:01.557 --> 00:14:04.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against the crafty acts of the Devil.”

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:09.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After speaking about the importance
of putting on the spiritual suit of armor,

00:14:09.832 --> 00:14:13.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul goes on to say in verse 18

00:14:13.068 --> 00:14:17.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this should be done together
“with every form of prayer

00:14:17.106 --> 00:14:19.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and supplication

00:14:19.141 --> 00:14:23.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[as we] carry on prayer
on every occasion in spirit.”

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:28.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what have we learned from our discussion?

00:14:28.217 --> 00:14:33.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seems that Satan didn’t try again
to tempt Jesus directly,

00:14:33.222 --> 00:14:35.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he was persistent.

00:14:35.224 --> 00:14:38.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He kept coming back in different guises.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He used others to give Jesus wrong advice,

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to oppose and ridicule him,

00:14:43.999 --> 00:14:47.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as to try to make him a king.

00:14:47.336 --> 00:14:52.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps we’ve rejected
some serious temptations in the past,

00:14:52.141 --> 00:14:55.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but remember, Satan doesn’t give up on us

00:14:55.711 --> 00:14:58.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just because he failed in the past.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At a time convenient to him,

00:15:01.216 --> 00:15:06.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he may come back to tempt us
with something completely different

00:15:06.021 --> 00:15:08.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the same temptation

00:15:08.791 --> 00:15:11.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dressed up in a different form.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:16.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the key
to not entering into temptation?

00:15:16.465 --> 00:15:21.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to remember and apply
Jesus’ admonition:

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:23.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Pray continually,

00:15:23.706 --> 00:15:27.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you may not enter into temptation.”
