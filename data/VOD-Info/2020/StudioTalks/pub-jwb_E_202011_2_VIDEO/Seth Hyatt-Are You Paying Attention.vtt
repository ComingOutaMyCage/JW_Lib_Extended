Are you paying attention?

00:00:05.188 --> 00:00:07.257 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps you’ve been asked that question

00:00:07.257 --> 00:00:09.726 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by your parents, a teacher,

00:00:09.726 --> 00:00:12.495 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or someone else in authority.

00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:17.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a good question
for each of us to ask ourselves.

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:20.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you think
of occasions associated with our worship

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that require us to pay special attention?

00:00:25.208 --> 00:00:30.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, when reading the Bible,
attending meetings,

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:32.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
elders when shepherding,

00:00:32.248 --> 00:00:36.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you children
when being instructed by your parents.

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:38.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to pay attention,

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:42.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet there are so many distractions

00:00:42.092 --> 00:00:44.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—electronic gadgets,

00:00:44.094 --> 00:00:48.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the conversations and activities
of those around us.

00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:52.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Truly, it can be a challenge
to pay attention.

00:00:53.436 --> 00:00:56.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you know that the phrase “pay attention”

00:00:56.506 --> 00:01:01.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
occurs dozens of times
in the <i>New World Translation?</i>

00:01:01.177 --> 00:01:03.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In many of those occurrences,

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:07.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is instructing his people
to pay attention.

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does it mean to “pay attention”?

00:01:11.254 --> 00:01:13.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how important is it

00:01:13.623 --> 00:01:18.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you and I pay attention to Jehovah?

00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:21.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The account in 1 Samuel chapter 15

00:01:21.464 --> 00:01:25.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help us to answer those questions.

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:28.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 3, Jehovah instructs King Saul

00:01:28.772 --> 00:01:31.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to strike down the Amalekites

00:01:31.241 --> 00:01:35.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to devote them
and everything they have to destruction.

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:40.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, verses 8 and 9 tell us

00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:43.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Saul did not obey.

00:01:43.386 --> 00:01:45.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He spared the king of Amalek

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the best of the animals.

00:01:49.225 --> 00:01:51.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did Saul respond

00:01:51.728 --> 00:01:55.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Samuel confronted him?

00:01:55.298 --> 00:01:58.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we read verses 13-15,

00:01:58.735 --> 00:02:03.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note how Saul tried to justify
his disobedience:

00:02:04.674 --> 00:02:07.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When Samuel finally came to him,

00:02:07.477 --> 00:02:09.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Saul said to him:

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘May Jehovah bless you.

00:02:11.681 --> 00:02:15.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have carried out the word of Jehovah.’

00:02:15.485 --> 00:02:17.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But Samuel said:

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Then what is this sound
of the flock in my ears

00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:24.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the sound of the cattle that I hear?’

00:02:24.594 --> 00:02:26.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To this Saul said:

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:29.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘They were brought from the Amalekites,

00:02:29.132 --> 00:02:33.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘because the people spared
the best of the flock and the herd

00:02:33.703 --> 00:02:37.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for sacrificing them to Jehovah your God;

00:02:37.974 --> 00:02:42.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what was left
we devoted to destruction.’”

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice?

00:02:44.914 --> 00:02:49.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saul attempted to justify his disobedience,

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
claiming that the animals
would be sacrificed to Jehovah.

00:02:55.191 --> 00:02:58.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was Jehovah pleased with Saul?

00:02:58.361 --> 00:03:00.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we read verse 22,

00:03:00.697 --> 00:03:04.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please note the connection
between paying attention

00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:06.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and obedience:

00:03:08.071 --> 00:03:10.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Samuel then said:

00:03:10.974 --> 00:03:15.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Does Jehovah take as much pleasure
in burnt offerings and sacrifices

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:19.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘as in obeying the voice of Jehovah?

00:03:19.916 --> 00:03:21.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Look!

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:25.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘To obey is better than a sacrifice,

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:30.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to pay attention than the fat of rams.’”

00:03:30.093 --> 00:03:35.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was one of the causes
of Saul’s disobedience?

00:03:35.098 --> 00:03:39.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t pay attention
to Jehovah’s instructions.

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:43.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His failure to pay attention
resulted in disobedience

00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:47.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and brought Jehovah’s disapproval.

00:03:47.377 --> 00:03:50.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a powerful lesson for us!

00:03:50.613 --> 00:03:52.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As happened with Saul,

00:03:52.615 --> 00:03:56.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our worship
could become unacceptable to Jehovah

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:59.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we fail to pay attention!

00:04:00.523 --> 00:04:05.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now that we understand
why it is important to pay attention,

00:04:05.361 --> 00:04:09.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s consider
three aspects of paying attention

00:04:09.098 --> 00:04:12.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are discussed in the Bible.

00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:14.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first scripture we’ll consider

00:04:14.637 --> 00:04:18.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is 2 Chronicles 19:6:

00:04:20.944 --> 00:04:25.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he [Jehoshaphat] said to the judges:

00:04:25.915 --> 00:04:30.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Pay attention to what you are doing,

00:04:30.153 --> 00:04:34.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for you do not judge for man
but for Jehovah,

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:38.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he is with you when you pass judgment.’”

00:04:39.896 --> 00:04:43.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This admonition to “pay attention”

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:45.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was given by King Jehoshaphat

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:49.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to appointed judges
throughout the land of Judah.

00:04:49.138 --> 00:04:52.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a sobering reminder!

00:04:52.342 --> 00:04:54.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those judges had good reason

00:04:54.877 --> 00:04:58.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pay attention to what they were doing.

00:04:58.147 --> 00:04:59.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:04:59.916 --> 00:05:02.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were responsible to Jehovah.

00:05:02.952 --> 00:05:04.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They represented him,

00:05:04.954 --> 00:05:09.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their decisions
affected the lives of fellow worshippers.

00:05:09.525 --> 00:05:14.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thus, they needed to be familiar
with Jehovah’s thinking on matters

00:05:14.097 --> 00:05:17.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to hold to his unprejudiced viewpoint

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when handling matters.

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:24.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is an excellent reminder
for those who serve as elders.

00:05:24.007 --> 00:05:27.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good elders are good students of the Bible

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:29.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Bible-based publications.

00:05:29.812 --> 00:05:31.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:05:31.381 --> 00:05:34.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their attentiveness to Jehovah

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:39.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enables them to pay attention
to what they are doing.

00:05:39.122 --> 00:05:41.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they are going to represent Jehovah

00:05:41.624 --> 00:05:45.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reflect his thinking accurately
as they handle matters

00:05:45.695 --> 00:05:48.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—whether they’re shepherding
the congregation,

00:05:48.498 --> 00:05:50.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
delivering a part at a meeting,

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
caring for a challenging assignment,

00:05:53.503 --> 00:05:56.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or addressing wrongdoing

00:05:56.172 --> 00:06:00.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they must pay attention
to what they are doing.

00:06:00.076 --> 00:06:03.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is why they must be familiar
with Jehovah’s thinking

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:07.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then take care to follow his direction.

00:06:07.583 --> 00:06:11.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they do, they show
that they are paying attention

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:14.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to what they are doing.

00:06:14.323 --> 00:06:17.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s interest in assisting the elders

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is demonstrated
in the ongoing education he provides.

00:06:21.931 --> 00:06:25.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each time the circuit overseer
visits the congregation,

00:06:25.535 --> 00:06:30.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he presents material
prepared especially for the elders.

00:06:30.406 --> 00:06:35.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Kingdom Ministry School
and the School for Congregation Elders

00:06:35.078 --> 00:06:38.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provide more intensive instruction.

00:06:38.081 --> 00:06:39.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How important

00:06:39.782 --> 00:06:42.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that elders pay close attention to

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:45.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and apply such instruction!

00:06:45.888 --> 00:06:49.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their doing so protects,
not just themselves

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:52.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also fellow worshippers.

00:06:52.862 --> 00:06:55.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By paying attention, elders will be able

00:06:55.832 --> 00:07:00.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to convey direction
to the congregations accurately.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:04.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This can be especially important
if our worship is banned

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or restricted
in the event of a natural disaster

00:07:08.344 --> 00:07:11.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or other catastrophic event.

00:07:11.714 --> 00:07:15.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This brings us
to the second aspect of paying attention

00:07:15.251 --> 00:07:17.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ll consider.

00:07:17.286 --> 00:07:21.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read Luke 8:18:

00:07:21.924 --> 00:07:24.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore,

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:29.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“pay attention to how you listen,

00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:32.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for whoever has will be given more,

00:07:32.201 --> 00:07:34.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but whoever does not have,

00:07:34.303 --> 00:07:38.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even what he imagines he has
will be taken away from him.”

00:07:40.476 --> 00:07:43.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did Jesus mean when he said:

00:07:43.246 --> 00:07:47.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Pay attention to how you listen”?

00:07:47.316 --> 00:07:51.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those in Jesus’ audience in the first century

00:07:51.087 --> 00:07:55.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had the wonderful privilege
of hearing Jesus’ literal voice

00:07:55.458 --> 00:07:57.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he instructed them.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:02.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we can’t hear
the voice of Jesus today,

00:08:02.331 --> 00:08:06.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we can read his words
and learn of his actions

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:09.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as revealed in the Gospel accounts.

00:08:09.038 --> 00:08:13.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, we have many opportunities to listen

00:08:13.676 --> 00:08:16.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah, Jesus,

00:08:16.479 --> 00:08:19.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the faithful and discreet slave,”

00:08:19.248 --> 00:08:22.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the elders in our congregation,

00:08:22.018 --> 00:08:24.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our marriage mate, 

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our children.

00:08:26.255 --> 00:08:28.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No wonder the Bible writer James stated

00:08:28.858 --> 00:08:33.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “everyone must be quick to listen.”

00:08:33.796 --> 00:08:35.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it:

00:08:35.798 --> 00:08:38.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Saul had truly listened receptively

00:08:38.467 --> 00:08:41.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah’s direction
regarding the Amalekites,

00:08:41.971 --> 00:08:46.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would likely have grasped
the importance of the direction he received

00:08:46.475 --> 00:08:50.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and would have been motivated to obey.

00:08:50.012 --> 00:08:52.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, his lack of attentiveness

00:08:52.715 --> 00:08:57.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
led to disobedience
and Jehovah’s disapproval.

00:08:58.588 --> 00:09:01.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we don’t pay attention to how we listen,

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:04.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could find ourselves becoming critical

00:09:04.994 --> 00:09:06.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or unappreciative

00:09:06.996 --> 00:09:10.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even disobedient.

00:09:10.466 --> 00:09:14.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as Jehovah instructs and directs us,

00:09:14.303 --> 00:09:17.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to think
about what we are being told,

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ponder over its meaning,

00:09:19.875 --> 00:09:23.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mull it over in our mind
and, most important,

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
apply the instruction in our own lives.

00:09:28.618 --> 00:09:30.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re a young person,

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how can you show that you’re paying attention

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:36.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to how you listen?

00:09:36.959 --> 00:09:41.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider the admonition
at Ephesians 6:1-3:

00:09:43.699 --> 00:09:47.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Children, be obedient to your parents

00:09:47.536 --> 00:09:49.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in union with the Lord,

00:09:49.572 --> 00:09:51.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for this is righteous.

00:09:51.707 --> 00:09:54.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Honor your father and your mother’

00:09:54.443 --> 00:09:57.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is the first command with a promise:

00:09:57.179 --> 00:09:59.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘That it may go well with you

00:09:59.181 --> 00:10:02.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you may remain a long time
on the earth.’”

00:10:04.887 --> 00:10:09.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You children, who do you think
is the source of this direction?

00:10:10.893 --> 00:10:14.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that these words come from Jehovah.

00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:18.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice that the verses state not only

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that children
should “be obedient” to their parents

00:10:22.004 --> 00:10:26.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also that they should
“honor” their parents?

00:10:28.311 --> 00:10:31.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you show that you’re paying attention

00:10:31.113 --> 00:10:35.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to how you listen to this direction?

00:10:35.184 --> 00:10:38.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was a boy, I can remember occasions

00:10:38.321 --> 00:10:41.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when my parents would ask me
to do something,

00:10:41.257 --> 00:10:44.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps to take out the trash.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would always obey.

00:10:47.129 --> 00:10:49.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at times, I’d make it very clear

00:10:49.865 --> 00:10:53.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I didn’t really want to do
what was asked.

00:10:53.803 --> 00:10:56.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think you young ones know what I mean.

00:10:58.374 --> 00:11:01.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, if we’re truly paying attention

00:11:01.043 --> 00:11:04.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to how we listen to Jehovah’s words,

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll be careful to honor our parents,

00:11:08.184 --> 00:11:11.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is an essential element of obedience.

00:11:11.954 --> 00:11:16.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this way, we contribute
to the peace of the family,

00:11:16.158 --> 00:11:20.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we make Jehovah’s heart glad.

00:11:20.996 --> 00:11:25.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally,
as the promise in verse 3 indicates,

00:11:25.301 --> 00:11:29.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
paying attention to how you listen
will protect you

00:11:29.605 --> 00:11:32.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and contribute to your success in other ways

00:11:32.808 --> 00:11:35.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
throughout your adult life.

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:38.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, all of us should remember

00:11:38.681 --> 00:11:41.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our everlasting welfare will depend

00:11:41.117 --> 00:11:45.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on our willingness to listen and obey.

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:48.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How important, then, that all of us

00:11:48.858 --> 00:11:53.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pay attention to how we listen.

00:11:53.195 --> 00:11:56.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The third aspect of paying attention is found

00:11:56.599 --> 00:12:01.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Luke 21:34, 35:

00:12:04.039 --> 00:12:07.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But pay attention to yourselves

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:10.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that your hearts never become weighed down

00:12:10.579 --> 00:12:13.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with overeating and heavy drinking

00:12:13.349 --> 00:12:16.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and anxieties of life,

00:12:16.018 --> 00:12:21.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and suddenly that day
be instantly upon you as a snare.”

00:12:23.459 --> 00:12:25.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jesus admonished his followers

00:12:25.895 --> 00:12:29.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pay attention to themselves,

00:12:29.031 --> 00:12:33.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he didn’t have in mind the selfish thinking
that characterized King Saul

00:12:33.936 --> 00:12:38.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s so common, even encouraged,
in today’s world.

00:12:39.408 --> 00:12:41.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, Jesus’ words reveal

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:44.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the key to paying attention to ourselves

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is knowing ourselves

00:12:47.383 --> 00:12:51.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—knowing what’s in our figurative heart.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a challenge for all of us.

00:12:54.023 --> 00:12:55.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:12:55.691 --> 00:13:00.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible explains at Jeremiah 17:9:

00:13:00.329 --> 00:13:04.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The heart is more treacherous
than anything else

00:13:04.333 --> 00:13:06.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and is desperate.

00:13:06.969 --> 00:13:10.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who can know it?”

00:13:10.005 --> 00:13:12.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 10 answers:

00:13:12.408 --> 00:13:15.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I, Jehovah, am searching the heart,

00:13:15.478 --> 00:13:19.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
examining the innermost thoughts.”

00:13:19.415 --> 00:13:23.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah knows what is in our heart,

00:13:23.252 --> 00:13:26.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he can help us to know.

00:13:26.255 --> 00:13:30.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can help us to examine
our motives and goals

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:34.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to discern why we do certain things.

00:13:34.096 --> 00:13:39.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Carefully and honestly looking at ourselves
in the mirror of God’s Word

00:13:39.101 --> 00:13:42.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can reveal areas in our thinking, words,

00:13:42.204 --> 00:13:44.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and actions

00:13:44.206 --> 00:13:46.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that need attention.

00:13:46.275 --> 00:13:49.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, some of Jehovah’s people

00:13:49.645 --> 00:13:51.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—including those of retirement age

00:13:51.747 --> 00:13:55.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have enjoyed
very comfortable circumstances—

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:59.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have concluded that they needed to make
adjustments in their lifestyle,

00:13:59.154 --> 00:14:01.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
simplifying their lives

00:14:01.323 --> 00:14:05.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they can serve Jehovah more fully.

00:14:05.427 --> 00:14:08.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some who have done so have had the privilege

00:14:08.497 --> 00:14:12.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of attending
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:14:12.301 --> 00:14:15.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although it meant
stepping out of their comfort zone,

00:14:15.838 --> 00:14:19.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps moving to a new congregation,

00:14:19.708 --> 00:14:24.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’ve experienced Jehovah’s blessing
in ways that they couldn’t have anticipated

00:14:24.713 --> 00:14:27.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they share
the benefits of their experience

00:14:27.683 --> 00:14:29.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and theocratic education

00:14:29.852 --> 00:14:31.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their new assignments.

00:14:32.955 --> 00:14:34.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How grateful we are

00:14:34.957 --> 00:14:39.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is providing ongoing,
life-saving instruction

00:14:39.128 --> 00:14:42.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of his Word and organization.

00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:46.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May each of us be determined
to “pay attention”

00:14:46.769 --> 00:14:48.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to what we are doing,

00:14:48.837 --> 00:14:50.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to how we listen,

00:14:50.839 --> 00:14:53.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to ourselves.

00:14:53.642 --> 00:14:58.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By doing so, we’ll avoid falling
into the trap of disobedience

00:14:58.647 --> 00:15:00.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as King Saul did.

00:15:00.716 --> 00:15:05.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, as attentive and obedient servants,

00:15:05.554 --> 00:15:09.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll enjoy Jehovah’s friendship forever.
