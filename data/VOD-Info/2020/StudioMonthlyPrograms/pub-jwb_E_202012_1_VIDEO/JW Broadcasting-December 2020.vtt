00:00:02.252 --> 00:00:04.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome!

00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:06.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Usually, our December program

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
features the Gilead graduation program

00:00:09.793 --> 00:00:12.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
held in September of each year.

00:00:12.328 --> 00:00:16.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the 149th class of Gilead

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was scheduled to arrive in the United States

00:00:19.335 --> 00:00:23.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the COVID-19 pandemic was underway.

00:00:23.973 --> 00:00:27.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, that class was postponed.

00:00:28.178 --> 00:00:30.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this month, we’ll focus on being

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the best Bible teachers we can be!

00:00:35.385 --> 00:00:37.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are a few highlights:

00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:41.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cecilio and Schera made many sacrifices

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:43.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help their students become

00:00:43.526 --> 00:00:46.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dedicated worshippers of Jehovah.

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:48.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see the impact

00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:51.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they had on Mercedes and Abel.

00:00:52.402 --> 00:00:54.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The arrival of a baby brings

00:00:54.904 --> 00:00:58.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
great joy as well as new challenges.

00:00:59.876 --> 00:01:01.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll learn how Jehovah helps

00:01:01.878 --> 00:01:06.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
first-time parents adjust
to their new responsibilities.

00:01:07.584 --> 00:01:09.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ll learn how Louise Blanton’s parents

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:12.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prepared her for a satisfying life

00:01:12.555 --> 00:01:14.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s service.

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:18.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is JW Broadcasting®

00:01:18.628 --> 00:01:21.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for December 2020!

00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:42.185 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My comments this month

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:46.556 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
are drawn from 1 Corinthians 3:10:

00:01:46.556 --> 00:01:48.558 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Let each one keep watching

00:01:48.558 --> 00:01:50.593 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
how he is building.”

00:01:50.593 --> 00:01:52.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Building

00:01:52.595 --> 00:01:55.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—are we talking
about the upcoming construction

00:01:55.298 --> 00:02:00.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a facility for headquarters departments
in Ramapo, New York?

00:02:00.303 --> 00:02:05.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or are we referring to the building
of new Kingdom Halls in your country?

00:02:06.176 --> 00:02:10.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as important
as those building projects are,

00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:15.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my comments are directed
to an even more important building work.

00:02:17.086 --> 00:02:19.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at the context

00:02:19.322 --> 00:02:23.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Corinthians 3:5.

00:02:25.695 --> 00:02:28.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Apollos and Paul are mentioned by name.

00:02:28.765 --> 00:02:32.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what was their specific role
identified to be?

00:02:32.302 --> 00:02:34.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 5 says

00:02:34.304 --> 00:02:39.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“ministers through whom you
became believers.”

00:02:39.776 --> 00:02:44.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Apollos and Paul had taught
the Scriptures to many in Corinth.

00:02:44.314 --> 00:02:46.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verses 6 through 9,

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:51.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul likens this teaching activity
to the planting of a field.

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:55.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeds of truth are planted
in the heart of a person.

00:02:55.525 --> 00:02:59.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By means of return visits and Bible studies,

00:02:59.162 --> 00:03:01.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the seeds are watered.

00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:04.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if the person is receptive,

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then with Jehovah’s spirit and blessing,

00:03:07.804 --> 00:03:10.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the truth will blossom

00:03:10.206 --> 00:03:14.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and grow to the point of dedication
and baptism.

00:03:15.578 --> 00:03:18.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice in verse 9

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:23.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Bible teachers are described
as “God’s fellow workers”?

00:03:24.554 --> 00:03:28.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an awesome privilege we have
to assist Jehovah

00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:33.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in gathering “the precious things
of all the nations”!

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:38.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we now know the topic of these verses

00:03:38.835 --> 00:03:41.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 1 Corinthians chapter 3.

00:03:41.604 --> 00:03:43.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s discussing Bible teachers

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who help others to become believers.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did you also notice that in verse 9,

00:03:51.214 --> 00:03:54.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul changes illustrations?

00:03:54.083 --> 00:03:59.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said:
“You are God’s field under cultivation”

00:03:59.088 --> 00:04:01.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s agricultural.

00:04:01.457 --> 00:04:03.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then he changes the analogy,

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
saying “God’s building”

00:04:07.063 --> 00:04:12.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s architectural; that’s construction.

00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:15.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why the change in illustrations?

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:20.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The building analogy
highlights a specific point.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, the illustration of the farmer

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:28.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t focus on the farmer’s impact
on the growth of a plant.

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:32.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In that illustration,
the farmer waters the seedling,

00:04:32.622 --> 00:04:37.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s God that makes the plant grow.

00:04:37.226 --> 00:04:42.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the illustration of building,
or construction,

00:04:42.231 --> 00:04:45.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
focuses on the builder’s involvement,

00:04:45.234 --> 00:04:48.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the Bible teacher’s involvement.

00:04:49.005 --> 00:04:53.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The one constructing a building
has considerable influence

00:04:53.343 --> 00:04:56.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over the quality of the end product.

00:04:56.713 --> 00:05:00.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What kind of materials does he select?

00:05:00.316 --> 00:05:03.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is he thorough in his work,

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:06.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or does he cut corners
to get the job done faster

00:05:06.923 --> 00:05:09.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or with less effort?

00:05:10.026 --> 00:05:12.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s read the 10th verse

00:05:12.462 --> 00:05:16.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 1 Corinthians chapter 3:

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:21.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“According to the undeserved kindness of God
that was given to me,

00:05:21.904 --> 00:05:26.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I laid a foundation
as a skilled master builder,

00:05:26.642 --> 00:05:28.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but someone else is building on it.

00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:31.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But let each one keep watching

00:05:31.347 --> 00:05:34.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how he is building on it.”

00:05:34.317 --> 00:05:38.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There in Corinth,
Paul, as a “master builder,”

00:05:38.154 --> 00:05:42.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had initially acquainted many with the truth.

00:05:42.992 --> 00:05:45.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In effect, he “laid a foundation”

00:05:45.962 --> 00:05:48.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for others to build on.

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:50.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what was that foundation?

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 11 says:

00:05:52.902 --> 00:05:57.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For no one can lay any other foundation

00:05:57.206 --> 00:06:01.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“than what is laid,
which is Jesus Christ.”

00:06:02.845 --> 00:06:06.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul had helped establish
the congregation there in Corinth

00:06:06.182 --> 00:06:09.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
based on the teachings of Jesus,

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:12.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the foundation of the truth.

00:06:12.855 --> 00:06:15.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Building on that foundation,

00:06:15.091 --> 00:06:18.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
others would become Bible teachers

00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:22.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help still others
to progress toward baptism.

00:06:22.432 --> 00:06:25.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is why Paul cautioned in verse 10

00:06:25.234 --> 00:06:29.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “keep watching how” we build.

00:06:29.338 --> 00:06:32.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can affect the outcome.

00:06:32.608 --> 00:06:37.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So to all of us Bible teachers,
including parents,

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we ask the question,

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:42.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How are we building on the foundation?

00:06:44.454 --> 00:06:47.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why does it really matter?

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read verses 12 and 13:

00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:55.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now if anyone builds on the foundation

00:06:55.031 --> 00:06:58.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“gold, silver, precious stones,

00:06:58.134 --> 00:07:00.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“wood, hay, or straw,

00:07:00.636 --> 00:07:03.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“each one’s work
will be shown for what it is,

00:07:03.906 --> 00:07:06.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for the day will show it up,

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:09.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because it will be revealed
by means of fire,

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:12.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the fire itself will prove

00:07:12.315 --> 00:07:15.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what sort of work each one has built.”

00:07:16.619 --> 00:07:19.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we understand how important it is

00:07:19.055 --> 00:07:22.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to analyze our teaching techniques?

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:27.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will we use the best techniques possible

00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:30.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach our student’s or our child’s heart?

00:07:31.467 --> 00:07:34.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or do we just try to get by
with the bare essentials,

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:38.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in effect, a halfhearted effort,

00:07:38.174 --> 00:07:42.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
using hay or straw, as it were?

00:07:43.246 --> 00:07:46.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some years ago in one developing country

00:07:46.816 --> 00:07:48.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during an economic boom,

00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:50.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it became a priority

00:07:50.953 --> 00:07:54.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build more and more schools.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:59.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unfortunately, building requirements
and materials

00:07:59.028 --> 00:08:01.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were substandard.

00:08:01.964 --> 00:08:06.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what happened
when a 7.9-magnitude earthquake

00:08:06.602 --> 00:08:08.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hit one of the areas?

00:08:08.938 --> 00:08:13.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many schools in the earthquake zone crumbled

00:08:13.376 --> 00:08:17.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while buildings around them
remained standing.

00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:20.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An official report indicated

00:08:20.249 --> 00:08:25.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that over 5,000 students died.

00:08:25.254 --> 00:08:27.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it.

00:08:27.456 --> 00:08:31.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prior to the earthquake,
schools were in session

00:08:31.394 --> 00:08:33.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and everything seemed fine.

00:08:33.896 --> 00:08:35.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Students and faculty

00:08:35.898 --> 00:08:39.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were coming and going on a daily basis.

00:08:39.869 --> 00:08:43.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the unforeseen earthquake proved

00:08:43.406 --> 00:08:45.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the building methods used

00:08:45.408 --> 00:08:49.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were not of the quality needed
to prevent collapse

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:51.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and terrible carnage.

00:08:53.182 --> 00:08:58.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians 3:13 makes clear

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:02.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that how we build spiritually
when teaching Bible students

00:09:02.225 --> 00:09:04.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or our children

00:09:04.227 --> 00:09:07.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is just as important.

00:09:08.564 --> 00:09:12.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now notice the sobering point

00:09:12.468 --> 00:09:17.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made in verses 14 and 15:

00:09:18.674 --> 00:09:22.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If anyone’s work
that he has built on it remains,

00:09:22.845 --> 00:09:25.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he will receive a reward;

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:30.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“if anyone’s work is burned up,
he will suffer loss,

00:09:30.253 --> 00:09:32.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but he himself will be saved;

00:09:32.255 --> 00:09:36.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yet, if so, it will be as through fire.”

00:09:37.927 --> 00:09:42.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The point in verse 14 is
that if we’re conscientious

00:09:42.765 --> 00:09:45.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reach the hearts of our Bible students,

00:09:45.601 --> 00:09:48.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that may be what gives them
the needed fortitude

00:09:48.971 --> 00:09:52.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to withstand unexpected trials.

00:09:52.408 --> 00:09:56.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In that case, our diligent work “remains.”

00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:58.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then verse 15 makes the point

00:09:58.981 --> 00:10:03.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if our teaching techniques
were inconsistent

00:10:03.386 --> 00:10:06.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or were in some way slipshod,

00:10:06.122 --> 00:10:10.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our student
may not successfully weather a “fire,”

00:10:10.793 --> 00:10:14.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or stormy trial in his life.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We personally may survive,

00:10:17.633 --> 00:10:21.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we might suffer the loss
of the one we studied with,

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:23.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether a Bible student

00:10:23.806 --> 00:10:25.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or our own child.

00:10:26.909 --> 00:10:29.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why Paul is highlighting the need

00:10:29.245 --> 00:10:32.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be the best Bible teacher

00:10:32.281 --> 00:10:34.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we personally can be.

00:10:36.085 --> 00:10:39.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, we should mention

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:44.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if a person who progresses
to dedication and baptism

00:10:44.026 --> 00:10:47.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
later leaves the truth,

00:10:47.029 --> 00:10:51.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s not necessarily the responsibility
of the Bible teacher.

00:10:52.668 --> 00:10:55.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The teacher may have been very diligent

00:10:55.971 --> 00:10:59.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and used
the best of spiritual building materials.

00:11:00.543 --> 00:11:05.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the student or child
may not have responded from his heart.

00:11:05.548 --> 00:11:10.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or possibly he allowed
human imperfection or temptation

00:11:10.453 --> 00:11:14.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to cause him to deviate from the way.

00:11:14.857 --> 00:11:19.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the takeaway point
from 1 Corinthians chapter 3

00:11:19.862 --> 00:11:24.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to do our best
to build in our students or children

00:11:24.433 --> 00:11:27.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fire-resistant materials.

00:11:27.737 --> 00:11:30.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want them to remain

00:11:30.206 --> 00:11:33.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to endure the tests
that are sure to come their way.

00:11:35.444 --> 00:11:39.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What might be likened
to building with inferior materials

00:11:39.315 --> 00:11:42.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when studying the Bible with someone?

00:11:42.351 --> 00:11:46.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Possibly, we initially
aroused a person’s interest

00:11:46.555 --> 00:11:51.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by telling him about the hope
of everlasting life in Paradise.

00:11:51.193 --> 00:11:53.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s indeed Scriptural.

00:11:53.529 --> 00:11:56.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is that in itself building in such a way

00:11:56.932 --> 00:11:58.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the person will survive

00:11:58.934 --> 00:12:03.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a fiery trial of faith in the future?

00:12:04.306 --> 00:12:08.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if our teaching
consisted solely of saying,

00:12:08.377 --> 00:12:10.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you want to live forever in Paradise,

00:12:10.913 --> 00:12:14.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you must study, go to the meetings,

00:12:14.216 --> 00:12:17.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and share in the preaching work”?

00:12:17.219 --> 00:12:20.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, we are not building

00:12:20.723 --> 00:12:22.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way to ensure

00:12:22.758 --> 00:12:25.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the student or child

00:12:25.261 --> 00:12:28.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will resist the fire of trials

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:31.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or stand the test of time.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:36.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In effect, we’re using wood, hay, or straw.

00:12:38.441 --> 00:12:42.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember that Paul said
we are to build “on the foundation”?

00:12:43.813 --> 00:12:46.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said the foundation “is Jesus Christ.”

00:12:46.982 --> 00:12:50.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is <i>solid.</i>

00:12:50.252 --> 00:12:55.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ephesians 3:16, 17

00:12:55.257 --> 00:12:58.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help us to understand what it means

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build with quality materials

00:13:00.896 --> 00:13:05.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as gold, silver, and precious stones.

00:13:05.801 --> 00:13:10.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 16, it makes clear
that there’s a way

00:13:10.339 --> 00:13:15.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can “be made mighty
in the [person we] are inside.”

00:13:17.146 --> 00:13:19.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read verse 17:

00:13:19.448 --> 00:13:21.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And that through your faith

00:13:21.917 --> 00:13:25.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you may have the Christ
dwell in your hearts with love.

00:13:25.855 --> 00:13:30.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May you be rooted and established
on the foundation.”

00:13:31.427 --> 00:13:34.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we help our child or Bible student

00:13:34.663 --> 00:13:38.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
become strong, or mighty, spiritually?

00:13:38.601 --> 00:13:41.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, verse 17 said

00:13:41.437 --> 00:13:46.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it’s by having
“the Christ dwell in your hearts,”

00:13:46.008 --> 00:13:49.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just knowing Jesus in the head

00:13:49.645 --> 00:13:53.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but sounding
his teachings and personality down

00:13:53.616 --> 00:13:56.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into our student’s heart.

00:13:56.418 --> 00:14:00.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means to know Jesus so well

00:14:00.055 --> 00:14:04.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it’s as if he lives, or dwells,
inside of us

00:14:04.727 --> 00:14:08.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and motivates us as Christians.

00:14:08.464 --> 00:14:10.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The result?

00:14:10.466 --> 00:14:12.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 17 concluded by saying

00:14:12.968 --> 00:14:14.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the student would become

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:18.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“rooted and established on the foundation.”

00:14:18.908 --> 00:14:21.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, solidly grounded

00:14:21.477 --> 00:14:24.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Jesus Christ.

00:14:24.079 --> 00:14:26.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Hebrews 1:3

00:14:26.081 --> 00:14:29.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says that
“[Jesus] is the reflection of God’s glory

00:14:29.985 --> 00:14:34.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the exact representation
of his very being.”

00:14:34.957 --> 00:14:37.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus himself said:

00:14:37.326 --> 00:14:41.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No one comes to the Father
except through me.”

00:14:41.797 --> 00:14:45.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So building with fire-resistant materials
means

00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:48.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helping the student to love Jesus, yes,

00:14:48.904 --> 00:14:52.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also to have a close, loving relationship

00:14:52.741 --> 00:14:55.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah God himself.

00:14:56.478 --> 00:14:59.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why are we considering the theme

00:14:59.448 --> 00:15:03.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Keep Watching How You Are Building’ now?

00:15:03.953 --> 00:15:08.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is this more urgent than ever before?

00:15:09.625 --> 00:15:12.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s because all indications,

00:15:12.227 --> 00:15:15.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Scripturally and circumstantially,

00:15:15.397 --> 00:15:20.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
point to Satan’s evil system of things
coming to an abrupt end.

00:15:21.904 --> 00:15:26.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The physical indications
of Matthew chapter 24

00:15:26.241 --> 00:15:28.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the bizarre temperament described

00:15:28.777 --> 00:15:31.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 2 Timothy 3:1-5

00:15:31.714 --> 00:15:35.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
become more and more precise

00:15:35.017 --> 00:15:38.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we watch “the scene of this world” unfold.

00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:44.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can expect
even more opposition and persecution

00:15:44.827 --> 00:15:48.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from those who are opposed to our resolve

00:15:48.864 --> 00:15:51.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to stand on the side of Jehovah.

00:15:51.967 --> 00:15:54.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers in Russia and other lands

00:15:54.703 --> 00:15:58.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are experiencing this now.

00:15:58.273 --> 00:16:00.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some have been beaten

00:16:00.509 --> 00:16:02.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and brutalized in other ways.

00:16:02.978 --> 00:16:05.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we’ve heard,

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
others have been sentenced
to years in prison.

00:16:09.885 --> 00:16:14.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In recent years, the organization
has reminded us of what we can expect

00:16:14.657 --> 00:16:17.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the great tribulation begins.

00:16:19.495 --> 00:16:21.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember this video clip

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:25.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the <i>Pursue What Builds Loyalty</i>
video series

00:16:25.801 --> 00:16:29.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shown at the 2016 regional convention?

00:16:29.838 --> 00:16:31.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be reminded.

00:16:33.342 --> 00:16:37.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And your faith has led you here

00:16:37.446 --> 00:16:40.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as loyal servants of Jehovah,

00:16:40.683 --> 00:16:44.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
confident that Psalm 97:10

00:16:44.887 --> 00:16:47.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
applies to you personally:

00:16:47.956 --> 00:16:52.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[Jehovah] is guarding
the lives of his loyal ones.”

00:17:02.938 --> 00:17:04.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where are they?

00:17:06.842 --> 00:17:08.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try the basement!

00:17:13.282 --> 00:17:15.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Check that door!

00:17:55.257 --> 00:17:59.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That video series
has been affectionately called

00:17:59.895 --> 00:18:02.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the basement video.

00:18:02.264 --> 00:18:05.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was depicting one possible scenario

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could be considered a “fire”

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to 1 Corinthians 3:13.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The serious question
we want to ask ourselves is,

00:18:15.944 --> 00:18:18.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Would my Bible student or child

00:18:18.981 --> 00:18:23.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be in the basement with those other
faithful brothers and sisters?’

00:18:24.386 --> 00:18:27.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If not, would the reason be

00:18:27.089 --> 00:18:30.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of his own lack of faith?

00:18:30.425 --> 00:18:33.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or might it, at least in part, be

00:18:33.729 --> 00:18:38.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we did not take
our responsibility as a teacher

00:18:38.233 --> 00:18:40.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seriously enough?

00:18:41.804 --> 00:18:45.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did we build with fire-resistant materials

00:18:45.073 --> 00:18:49.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or, in effect, with hay or straw?

00:18:50.646 --> 00:18:52.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same verse said:

00:18:52.648 --> 00:18:56.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the day will show it up . . .

00:18:56.151 --> 00:18:58.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the fire itself will prove

00:18:58.453 --> 00:19:01.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what sort of work each one has built.”

00:19:01.557 --> 00:19:05.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a sobering thought, isn’t it?

00:19:05.594 --> 00:19:08.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you recall in the May 2020

00:19:08.263 --> 00:19:11.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
JW Broadcasting® monthly program,

00:19:11.834 --> 00:19:15.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Lett addressed the concern
a few parents have expressed

00:19:15.204 --> 00:19:17.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about some of our videos that depict

00:19:17.706 --> 00:19:21.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Biblical or modern-day situations.

00:19:21.977 --> 00:19:24.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In these, at times,
true worshippers are depicted

00:19:24.813 --> 00:19:27.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as having their faith tested 

00:19:27.216 --> 00:19:29.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as if by fire.

00:19:29.952 --> 00:19:33.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The concern expressed is that some scenes

00:19:33.422 --> 00:19:35.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could have an effect on children

00:19:35.991 --> 00:19:40.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who’ve been protected
from all negative circumstances on TV,

00:19:40.529 --> 00:19:44.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including daily news reports of catastrophes

00:19:44.132 --> 00:19:47.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being faced by real people.

00:19:47.803 --> 00:19:50.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The basement scene we just reviewed

00:19:50.305 --> 00:19:52.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was one of our videos

00:19:52.474 --> 00:19:56.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that produced such a reaction.

00:19:56.044 --> 00:19:59.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another one was the reenactment
of the Bible account

00:19:59.615 --> 00:20:04.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
depicting Jehovah’s saving acts
in the time of King Hezekiah.

00:20:04.653 --> 00:20:08.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was shown at the 2016 regional convention,

00:20:08.257 --> 00:20:10.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the video is entitled

00:20:10.359 --> 00:20:14.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>“O Jehovah, . . . I Trust in You.”</i>

00:20:14.363 --> 00:20:19.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look again
at that portrayal of Jehovah’s saving acts.

00:20:38.687 --> 00:20:41.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord!

00:20:44.893 --> 00:20:47.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If a parent has shielded his child

00:20:47.763 --> 00:20:50.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from viewing all scenes on the news

00:20:50.365 --> 00:20:55.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or other visual images
depicting negative realities,

00:20:55.370 --> 00:21:00.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s understandable
that there may be a concern.

00:21:00.275 --> 00:21:04.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, as Brother Lett stated:

00:21:04.546 --> 00:21:08.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Parents need to give their children
a realistic idea

00:21:08.984 --> 00:21:13.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘of what we will face in the near future.

00:21:13.488 --> 00:21:17.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Many parents choose to help
their children appreciate

00:21:17.059 --> 00:21:21.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘the graphic visual imagery
of a Bible-based account

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:25.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘while at the same time
building trust in Jehovah,

00:21:25.267 --> 00:21:28.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will be with them in times of distress.’

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:30.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The point is, friends,

00:21:30.706 --> 00:21:33.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible warns us, young and old alike,

00:21:33.642 --> 00:21:38.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a time of fiery testing
looms on the horizon.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:41.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to be realistic
and face these events

00:21:41.283 --> 00:21:44.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with faith and courage.

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our videos depict such circumstances

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:51.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a tasteful and sanitized way,

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:56.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not showing any actual acts of bloodshed
or violence.

00:21:57.966 --> 00:22:00.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be assured that the Governing Body

00:22:00.836 --> 00:22:04.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not trying to scare anyone.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, we are trying

00:22:07.009 --> 00:22:10.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prepare everyone.

00:22:10.245 --> 00:22:13.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We feel responsible
to fortify the brotherhood

00:22:13.648 --> 00:22:17.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by using fire-resistant building materials

00:22:17.285 --> 00:22:21.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the spirit of 1 Corinthians chapter 3.

00:22:21.223 --> 00:22:24.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As teachers of the Word of God,

00:22:24.493 --> 00:22:28.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may we all give prayerful thought
to the methods,

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:32.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
techniques, and the diligence we display

00:22:32.267 --> 00:22:35.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when conducting Bible studies.

00:22:35.404 --> 00:22:39.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re motivated
by the very spirit of Jehovah God.

00:22:40.809 --> 00:22:44.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The words at 2 Peter 3:9 come to mind.

00:22:44.379 --> 00:22:46.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of Jehovah, it says:

00:22:46.915 --> 00:22:51.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He does not desire anyone to be destroyed

00:22:51.319 --> 00:22:56.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but desires all to attain to repentance.”

00:22:56.291 --> 00:22:58.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May that be our resolve

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:03.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we take to heart
the inspired words of 1 Corinthians 3:10:

00:23:03.265 --> 00:23:08.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let each one keep watching
how he is building”!

00:23:09.938 --> 00:23:14.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having children
is one of the greatest joys in life

00:23:14.009 --> 00:23:17.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and one of the greatest responsibilities

00:23:17.045 --> 00:23:19.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah entrusts to a husband and wife.

00:23:20.382 --> 00:23:22.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:23:22.517 --> 00:23:26.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how the arrival
of a baby changes a marriage

00:23:26.555 --> 00:23:30.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how Jehovah helps first-time parents.

00:23:35.764 --> 00:23:39.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has been so good to us.

00:23:47.309 --> 00:23:52.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We enjoy a busy life full of blessings . . .

00:23:57.886 --> 00:24:02.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . including one we didn’t expect.

00:24:13.101 --> 00:24:17.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love our little Emma so much!

00:24:23.445 --> 00:24:27.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But child-rearing was harder than we thought.

00:24:49.104 --> 00:24:51.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most days went well

00:24:56.211 --> 00:24:59.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—others, not so much.

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:08.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just need some rest.

00:25:09.324 --> 00:25:12.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When will things be back to normal?

00:25:12.594 --> 00:25:15.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wake with every little cry!

00:25:16.898 --> 00:25:19.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wake when she’s silent.

00:25:19.534 --> 00:25:22.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Am I doing this right?

00:25:23.171 --> 00:25:26.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I should check on them.

00:25:27.209 --> 00:25:30.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Any time to ourselves was time to do nothing.

00:25:30.345 --> 00:25:35.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fatigue was affecting
our relationship with Jehovah . . .

00:25:36.551 --> 00:25:39.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . and each other.

00:25:52.467 --> 00:25:56.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were so relieved
when David, a father himself,

00:25:56.738 --> 00:26:00.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
offered to visit with another elder.

00:26:02.444 --> 00:26:06.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read Isaiah 40:29:

00:26:06.381 --> 00:26:09.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He gives power to the tired one

00:26:09.718 --> 00:26:12.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and full might to those lacking strength.”

00:26:14.856 --> 00:26:17.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a loving Father,

00:26:17.192 --> 00:26:19.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants parents to succeed.

00:26:19.261 --> 00:26:23.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he gives us
what we need to recharge us.

00:26:24.299 --> 00:26:26.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Things might never be like they were before.

00:26:26.501 --> 00:26:28.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But his suggestions helped us create

00:26:28.503 --> 00:26:32.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a practical and consistent spiritual routine.

00:26:32.007 --> 00:26:36.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David said it’s normal
for new parents to feel anxious,

00:26:36.745 --> 00:26:39.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and anxiety is tiring.

00:26:39.147 --> 00:26:42.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we pray for a calm heart . . .

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:46.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . and extra kindness when tired,

00:26:46.021 --> 00:26:51.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we can keep working as a team.

00:26:59.634 --> 00:27:03.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I so appreciate Zack’s help.

00:27:06.308 --> 00:27:11.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m sacrificing some unnecessary things

00:27:11.313 --> 00:27:15.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to put spiritual things first.

00:27:24.959 --> 00:27:27.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There will always be a lot to do.

00:27:30.965 --> 00:27:34.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when Emma sleeps,

00:27:34.769 --> 00:27:38.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feed my faith

00:27:38.873 --> 00:27:41.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and rest.

00:27:44.746 --> 00:27:49.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our new spiritual routine is invigorating.

00:28:05.166 --> 00:28:06.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Daddy!

00:28:06.701 --> 00:28:08.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look!

00:28:08.036 --> 00:28:09.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey.

00:28:17.345 --> 00:28:20.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah helped us to understand.

00:28:20.148 --> 00:28:23.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While life in this system
may have many challenges,

00:28:23.985 --> 00:28:26.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
putting spiritual things first

00:28:26.087 --> 00:28:28.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will give us the strength to meet them.

00:28:33.895 --> 00:28:38.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That new father wanted life
to get “back to normal.”

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But all parents realize

00:28:41.136 --> 00:28:45.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that having children creates a “new normal.”

00:28:46.274 --> 00:28:50.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you are first-time parents,
please remember,

00:28:50.311 --> 00:28:53.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one of the most important adjustments
you’ll make

00:28:53.882 --> 00:28:57.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to establish a new spiritual routine 

00:28:57.886 --> 00:29:02.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for yourselves
and your precious little child.

00:29:03.958 --> 00:29:06.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, children grow,

00:29:06.394 --> 00:29:09.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when they cross into their teenage years,

00:29:09.531 --> 00:29:12.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
suddenly, everything seems to change.

00:29:12.934 --> 00:29:17.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video,
notice how Rudy and Nenita Garcia

00:29:17.205 --> 00:29:21.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were determined to teach
their daughters Jehovah’s ways

00:29:21.242 --> 00:29:24.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the results they experienced.

00:29:25.613 --> 00:29:28.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We already had our firstborn, Renita.

00:29:28.283 --> 00:29:31.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then I was told
that we were going to have twins.

00:29:31.152 --> 00:29:34.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were new in the truth and inexperienced.

00:29:34.255 --> 00:29:37.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I was saying to myself:

00:29:37.292 --> 00:29:41.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How can I take care of my children,
not only physically but more so spiritually?

00:29:41.996 --> 00:29:45.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How will I be able
to teach them to love Jehovah,

00:29:45.533 --> 00:29:47.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to worship Jehovah?’

00:29:47.836 --> 00:29:50.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And 1 Corinthians 3:10 

00:29:50.104 --> 00:29:52.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shows us the importance

00:29:52.674 --> 00:29:54.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of raising a family

00:29:54.843 --> 00:29:57.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by using good quality materials.

00:29:57.979 --> 00:30:02.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So having a spiritual routine
is very important for the children.

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:07.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife and I would have to lay
a good spiritual foundation.

00:30:07.188 --> 00:30:10.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We would have to set
a good example for our children.

00:30:12.193 --> 00:30:16.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As long as I could remember,
I would always see my parents studying,

00:30:16.631 --> 00:30:18.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doing personal Bible study.

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:22.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember Dad—one time,
he came to us in the living room,

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:26.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he said, “You know,
I was reading Psalm 1:2, 

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:29.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“where it said we should find
‘delight in the law of Jehovah

00:30:29.444 --> 00:30:32.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and read in an undertone day and night.’”

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:35.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said, “What if we do this
as a family project,

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:40.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like, we read the Bible every day
out loud together?”

00:30:40.255 --> 00:30:42.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And my parents were very simple, you know.

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:46.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They didn’t require a lot of fancy things.

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were content.

00:30:47.862 --> 00:30:50.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom and Dad always worked part-time.

00:30:50.632 --> 00:30:54.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dad pioneered, so money was limited.

00:30:54.402 --> 00:30:58.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes the car we had
wasn’t the most reliable,

00:30:58.106 --> 00:31:00.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it would break down
right before the meeting.

00:31:00.408 --> 00:31:02.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember when our car broke down.

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:06.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Initially I thought,
‘Oh, we’re not going to go to the meeting.’

00:31:06.447 --> 00:31:09.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom and Dad would say:
“Well, the car broke down.

00:31:09.117 --> 00:31:11.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a meeting tonight, so let’s walk.”

00:31:12.787 --> 00:31:16.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there are the five of us
—my dad in his suit,

00:31:16.057 --> 00:31:19.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the four women would be
in our dresses with our book bags.

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so that taught me not to let obstacles

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:26.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and anxieties prevent me
from going to my meetings.

00:31:26.768 --> 00:31:31.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Spending quality time
was very important to my parents,

00:31:31.239 --> 00:31:33.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially after the meetings.

00:31:33.308 --> 00:31:36.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We would change
into our pajamas, grab a snack,

00:31:36.744 --> 00:31:39.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
go to the living room, and just start talking

00:31:39.581 --> 00:31:42.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how our day went
and how the meeting went.

00:31:46.854 --> 00:31:48.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just those special moments

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:51.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they brought us closer together.

00:31:51.759 --> 00:31:54.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw that Dad,

00:31:54.228 --> 00:31:56.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter how busy he was,

00:31:56.764 --> 00:32:01.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would drop what he was doing
and look at me and talk.

00:32:01.202 --> 00:32:05.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew I was more important
to him than what he was doing.

00:32:05.306 --> 00:32:08.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember a time
when I had a crush on a boy.

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:11.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My parents reasoned with me.

00:32:11.446 --> 00:32:15.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt very comfortable,
you know, after that point, to maybe talk 

00:32:15.483 --> 00:32:18.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about other things
because I could see that my parents

00:32:18.886 --> 00:32:21.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were not going to be angry at me.

00:32:21.322 --> 00:32:24.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, they were going
to listen to me and what I was feeling.

00:32:24.359 --> 00:32:28.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the blessings
that Mom and Dad gave me

00:32:28.696 --> 00:32:31.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was teaching me how to think

00:32:31.199 --> 00:32:34.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditate on scriptures.

00:32:34.102 --> 00:32:38.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They encouraged us to set full-time service,

00:32:38.172 --> 00:32:40.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or pioneering, as a goal.

00:32:40.575 --> 00:32:44.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all worked part-time, me and my siblings.

00:32:44.979 --> 00:32:48.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I remember one close family friend

00:32:48.683 --> 00:32:52.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
said to me: “You know,
your parents are getting older.

00:32:52.687 --> 00:32:56.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You know, you’re their daughter,
and you should probably work full-time.

00:32:57.492 --> 00:32:59.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That way they’d have more of an easy life.”

00:33:00.495 --> 00:33:03.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that sister’s conversation,
I almost gave up

00:33:03.731 --> 00:33:07.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on pioneering, but I knew deep down

00:33:07.201 --> 00:33:10.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that my parents
would not be happy about that.

00:33:10.505 --> 00:33:14.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They wanted us to spend
our youth serving Jehovah.

00:33:14.175 --> 00:33:19.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband and I were invited to attend

00:33:19.047 --> 00:33:23.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the 145th class of Gilead,
and that was like a dream come true.

00:33:23.718 --> 00:33:26.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have to thank my parents for that

00:33:26.921 --> 00:33:30.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they always
supported me through the years.

00:33:30.024 --> 00:33:32.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t have done it without them,

00:33:32.293 --> 00:33:35.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for that I’ll be forever grateful.

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:38.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really do thank my parents

00:33:38.066 --> 00:33:41.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the upbringing that they gave me.

00:33:41.436 --> 00:33:43.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a very happy life.

00:33:43.538 --> 00:33:45.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m thankful that I was able

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:48.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to avoid a lot of heartache,

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:52.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s because my parents raised me

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:54.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the truth and in Jehovah’s way.

00:33:54.949 --> 00:33:57.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Children are born imitators,

00:33:57.018 --> 00:34:01.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’re going to imitate our example.

00:34:01.422 --> 00:34:05.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to thank Jehovah
for what our family is now.

00:34:06.994 --> 00:34:11.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To see all of us in the pioneer work

00:34:11.432 --> 00:34:16.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all five of us are pioneering—
thank you, Jehovah.

00:34:17.405 --> 00:34:19.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raising three daughters

00:34:19.407 --> 00:34:23.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
took years of work and sacrifice.

00:34:23.144 --> 00:34:26.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Rudy and Nenita are joyful,

00:34:26.414 --> 00:34:31.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing their daughters
are happily serving Jehovah full-time.

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:35.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, if we build in our children

00:34:35.623 --> 00:34:38.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fire-resistant materials,

00:34:38.126 --> 00:34:40.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we give them everything they need

00:34:40.695 --> 00:34:44.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make wise decisions themselves.

00:34:44.832 --> 00:34:48.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was the case for Louise Blanton.

00:34:48.302 --> 00:34:52.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how her parents’ building techniques

00:34:52.006 --> 00:34:55.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped her to choose a fulfilling life.

00:34:58.079 --> 00:35:03.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My family started studying
with Witnesses in New Jersey.

00:35:03.017 --> 00:35:06.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My parents had been very diligent
in helping us to appreciate

00:35:06.921 --> 00:35:09.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only Bible principles

00:35:09.524 --> 00:35:11.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also characters in the Bible

00:35:11.926 --> 00:35:15.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who could be a role model for us.

00:35:15.062 --> 00:35:18.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helped us to know that Jehovah cared

00:35:18.966 --> 00:35:22.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only for adult publishers

00:35:22.503 --> 00:35:24.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also for the children

00:35:24.505 --> 00:35:27.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were serving him.

00:35:27.975 --> 00:35:30.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you went out in the ministry,

00:35:30.344 --> 00:35:34.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it became such a common thing

00:35:34.081 --> 00:35:36.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the police would come and pick you up.

00:35:36.651 --> 00:35:41.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they couldn’t track down the parents,
they would put the children in jail,

00:35:41.455 --> 00:35:45.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing that eventually the parents
would have to come looking for them.

00:35:46.561 --> 00:35:49.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The police would use scare tactics.

00:35:49.297 --> 00:35:53.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’d say: “There are rats in the cell.

00:35:53.668 --> 00:35:55.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that where you want to be?”

00:35:55.469 --> 00:35:58.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—anything to make you fearful,

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:03.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to intimidate you to tell them
where your parents were.

00:36:03.277 --> 00:36:05.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’d put us in the jail,

00:36:05.346 --> 00:36:09.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in order to build our faith,
we would sing.

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:12.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t have Kingdom melodies back then,

00:36:12.486 --> 00:36:15.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we used to make up songs,

00:36:15.223 --> 00:36:18.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that would keep us focused

00:36:18.025 --> 00:36:20.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on what we were doing there.

00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:24.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After I reached the age of 18,

00:36:24.031 --> 00:36:28.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my parents were agreeable
to my accepting an assignment.

00:36:28.669 --> 00:36:30.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in those years,

00:36:30.438 --> 00:36:35.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the racial issue in the south,

00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:38.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were so many areas in the south

00:36:38.946 --> 00:36:41.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where they didn’t have Kingdom Halls

00:36:41.082 --> 00:36:43.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the colored could attend.

00:36:43.951 --> 00:36:48.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you were free 
and you would accept an assignment,

00:36:48.856 --> 00:36:52.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Society usually sent you to the south.

00:36:52.426 --> 00:36:55.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My parents were both born in the south,

00:36:55.763 --> 00:37:00.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they were able to tell us what to expect

00:37:00.768 --> 00:37:03.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep the culture shock
from being so great.

00:37:04.906 --> 00:37:09.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was assigned to pioneer
in Andalusia, Alabama.

00:37:09.911 --> 00:37:14.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Based on all of the matters that pertain

00:37:14.815 --> 00:37:17.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to integration and segregation,

00:37:17.551 --> 00:37:20.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this was a hotbed

00:37:20.488 --> 00:37:24.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for testing those issues.

00:37:24.725 --> 00:37:27.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I was concerned

00:37:27.628 --> 00:37:30.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about whether I had the fiber

00:37:30.731 --> 00:37:34.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to work under those circumstances.

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:38.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The field was wide open.

00:37:38.472 --> 00:37:40.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were so many in the area

00:37:40.474 --> 00:37:44.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that had no knowledge of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:37:44.245 --> 00:37:47.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and were very receptive to the message.

00:37:47.515 --> 00:37:52.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That part of our ministry was very rewarding.

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:56.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had some very strong

00:37:56.290 --> 00:37:59.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helpful brothers

00:37:59.527 --> 00:38:02.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah was using

00:38:02.363 --> 00:38:07.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get his people

00:38:07.268 --> 00:38:09.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no matter what color—

00:38:09.503 --> 00:38:13.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to appreciate Him and his purpose.

00:38:13.908 --> 00:38:16.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you focused on these things

00:38:16.444 --> 00:38:18.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the suggestions and the ideas—

00:38:18.479 --> 00:38:20.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers would help you to appreciate

00:38:20.881 --> 00:38:23.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to deal with the issues.

00:38:23.384 --> 00:38:26.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They taught us, for one thing,

00:38:26.354 --> 00:38:29.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the whole purpose of the Ku Klux Klan

00:38:29.557 --> 00:38:32.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to intimidate.

00:38:32.293 --> 00:38:35.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They feel that if they frighten you enough,

00:38:35.129 --> 00:38:37.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will leave.

00:38:37.965 --> 00:38:40.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan has always used

00:38:40.501 --> 00:38:43.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
methods to try to intimidate.

00:38:43.137 --> 00:38:47.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we would make it a practice to stay,
to hold our place.

00:38:47.408 --> 00:38:51.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we were in street work,
we’d stay right there.

00:38:51.245 --> 00:38:53.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And of course, as they passed,

00:38:53.981 --> 00:38:56.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they had their remarks to make,

00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:58.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we just stood there.

00:38:58.552 --> 00:39:02.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I think back on my youth,

00:39:02.556 --> 00:39:05.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there isn’t anything that I was able
to participate in

00:39:05.893 --> 00:39:07.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I came to regret.

00:39:07.995 --> 00:39:10.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were always blessings
that went along with it.

00:39:10.765 --> 00:39:13.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you make yourself available,

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:16.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will use you.

00:39:16.771 --> 00:39:20.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is always there as a support.

00:39:20.875 --> 00:39:25.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There isn’t anything
that he directs his organization to do

00:39:26.881 --> 00:39:29.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that doesn’t receive his support.

00:39:30.084 --> 00:39:33.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if we are challenged with a new assignment

00:39:33.954 --> 00:39:38.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or if we feel inadequate about it,

00:39:38.092 --> 00:39:41.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we look to Jehovah

00:39:41.629 --> 00:39:44.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—with Jehovah, you can’t fail.

00:39:45.399 --> 00:39:49.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Louise’s parents
taught her to appreciate principles

00:39:49.503 --> 00:39:52.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and characters in the Bible.

00:39:52.106 --> 00:39:54.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That reached her heart

00:39:54.308 --> 00:39:58.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and aided Louise to endure difficult trials.

00:39:59.246 --> 00:40:01.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She has now spent over 50 years

00:40:01.849 --> 00:40:04.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of her life in the full-time service,

00:40:04.685 --> 00:40:09.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including over 40 years in Bethel service.

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:12.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hard work and sacrifice

00:40:12.226 --> 00:40:15.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may also be needed to help our Bible students

00:40:15.396 --> 00:40:17.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to become disciples.

00:40:17.665 --> 00:40:21.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see that in our next video.

00:40:25.206 --> 00:40:28.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A teacher should always help
his or her student

00:40:28.509 --> 00:40:32.379 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to develop love for Jehovah.

00:40:32.379 --> 00:40:34.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the best foundation to build on.

00:40:36.117 --> 00:40:39.286 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
For me, it’s important that they see Jehovah

00:40:39.286 --> 00:40:41.789 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
as a real Person.

00:40:41.789 --> 00:40:45.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In order to help them build
a good foundation, they need to know

00:40:45.392 --> 00:40:49.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah gave us the Bible
so that we can receive his guidance

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:51.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the future and for eternity.

00:40:54.001 --> 00:40:56.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m so thankful for my Bible teacher.

00:40:56.370 --> 00:40:59.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She always helped me see
Jehovah’s point of view

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:01.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on things from the Bible.

00:41:03.811 --> 00:41:05.646 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’ll never stop thanking Jehovah

00:41:05.646 --> 00:41:07.781 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for what he’s done for me.

00:41:07.781 --> 00:41:09.917 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He drew me to the truth.

00:41:09.917 --> 00:41:13.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave me a teacher
that didn’t just teach me about the Bible,

00:41:13.454 --> 00:41:15.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but by his example, the brother taught me

00:41:15.489 --> 00:41:17.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to really be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:41:20.094 --> 00:41:22.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I started studying,

00:41:22.096 --> 00:41:27.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my parents told me that they didn’t
consider me their daughter anymore.

00:41:28.936 --> 00:41:31.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the study, my teacher helped 

00:41:31.005 --> 00:41:35.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
me see from the Bible that Jehovah had
a lot of really good things in store for me.

00:41:43.551 --> 00:41:47.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My environment was very hostile before.

00:41:48.856 --> 00:41:51.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My problem was
that my wife and I argued a lot,

00:41:51.458 --> 00:41:53.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I had a bad temper.

00:41:55.462 --> 00:42:00.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brother’s advice really helped us
to keep calm when we had problems.

00:42:03.971 --> 00:42:07.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a person starts
getting to know Jehovah and they learn 

00:42:07.841 --> 00:42:10.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and apply Bible truths in their lives,

00:42:10.811 --> 00:42:15.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the people who were their friends before
are going to disappear.

00:42:15.549 --> 00:42:18.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to give them
that friendship they’re losing.

00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:26.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve had to make some sacrifices
for our students.

00:42:26.093 --> 00:42:28.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when we think about the blessings,

00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:31.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can barely remember the sacrifices.

00:42:32.666 --> 00:42:36.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I worked full-time,

00:42:36.136 --> 00:42:38.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I had to adapt to the student’s needs,

00:42:38.339 --> 00:42:40.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not the other way around.

00:42:41.008 --> 00:42:43.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I’d be up
at six o’clock in the morning

00:42:43.177 --> 00:42:45.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
conducting a Bible study.

00:42:45.579 --> 00:42:48.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes things come up,
and you can’t make it.

00:42:48.916 --> 00:42:51.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the study should still happen.

00:42:51.218 --> 00:42:55.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another brother can study with them
if we’re not going to be there.

00:42:55.222 --> 00:42:59.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When someone starts studying,
it can feel like a lot.

00:42:59.026 --> 00:43:02.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible itself has 66 books.

00:43:02.363 --> 00:43:06.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for example, you can suggest
that the student start reading

00:43:06.367 --> 00:43:08.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a few verses every day

00:43:08.335 --> 00:43:10.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then add a little more every week.

00:43:10.838 --> 00:43:13.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that is how we see them progress.

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:16.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You get to see them practice
what they’re learning

00:43:16.377 --> 00:43:19.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—really following the Bible’s counsel
in their lives.

00:43:20.814 --> 00:43:22.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t just conduct a study,

00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:24.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see them progress, get baptized,

00:43:24.918 --> 00:43:26.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then say, “OK, see you later.”

00:43:26.954 --> 00:43:29.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t work like that.
They become part of our life.

00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:35.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s been my friend
since before I got baptized.

00:43:35.162 --> 00:43:37.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been about 28 years now.

00:43:38.232 --> 00:43:42.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Years ago, my former student Abel
had a really difficult time.

00:43:42.936 --> 00:43:44.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His wife got sick.

00:43:45.639 --> 00:43:48.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although we were far away
when we heard about it,

00:43:48.142 --> 00:43:50.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we kept in touch with him.

00:43:53.013 --> 00:43:55.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Thank you, Livingston family,

00:43:55.015 --> 00:43:57.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for calling Jessica during these hard times.

00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:01.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s very encouraging to us.”

00:44:01.822 --> 00:44:05.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I know that you love us,
and we also love you very much.

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:10.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are an example in true worship for us.

00:44:10.097 --> 00:44:14.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May Jehovah continue caring
for you and blessing you.”

00:44:22.443 --> 00:44:24.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got baptized 34 years ago

00:44:24.678 --> 00:44:28.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have been pioneering for 33 years.

00:44:29.783 --> 00:44:32.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My Bible teacher was Schera.

00:44:32.786 --> 00:44:35.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was diagnosed with cancer.

00:44:35.122 --> 00:44:40.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I got sick, 
Jehovah used Mercedes to help me.

00:44:41.528 --> 00:44:44.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all this time, since I helped 

00:44:44.264 --> 00:44:48.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
her learn the truth, now she comforts me.

00:44:48.702 --> 00:44:51.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a father-son relationship.

00:44:51.538 --> 00:44:53.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At some point,

00:44:53.807 --> 00:44:55.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe this student will help me.

00:44:55.809 --> 00:44:58.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can say that ‘we are
good-for-nothing slaves,

00:44:58.379 --> 00:45:02.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we have done
what we ought to have done.’

00:45:02.049 --> 00:45:04.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they keep loving and serving Jehovah.

00:45:04.218 --> 00:45:06.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s better than that?

00:45:12.626 --> 00:45:14.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To expand their ministry,

00:45:14.628 --> 00:45:18.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many of Jehovah’s Witnesses
have learned a new language.

00:45:18.365 --> 00:45:20.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you?

00:45:20.367 --> 00:45:22.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Teaching someone the truth

00:45:22.369 --> 00:45:26.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the language
of their heart can be rewarding.

00:45:26.373 --> 00:45:28.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But learning to speak and think

00:45:28.742 --> 00:45:32.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a new language can also be tough.

00:45:32.112 --> 00:45:34.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a recent morning worship,

00:45:34.448 --> 00:45:39.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother William Malenfant
offered some practical suggestions.

00:45:40.454 --> 00:45:41.822 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Usually,

00:45:41.822 --> 00:45:43.323 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the language that we learned

00:45:43.323 --> 00:45:45.058 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from infancy becomes

00:45:45.058 --> 00:45:47.561 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the language of the heart,

00:45:47.561 --> 00:45:50.864 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and we learn it at home.

00:45:50.864 --> 00:45:53.033 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In most cases, the dominant influence

00:45:53.033 --> 00:45:56.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our life in connection
with our language of the heart,

00:45:56.303 --> 00:45:59.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the first language, is our mother.

00:45:59.039 --> 00:46:02.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s precisely what took place

00:46:02.142 --> 00:46:05.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Israel in the days of Nehemiah.

00:46:05.145 --> 00:46:07.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the mothers in this case were pagans

00:46:07.848 --> 00:46:12.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sharing their language and probably
their beliefs with their children.

00:46:12.719 --> 00:46:15.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And a lot of Jewish men
—prominent Jewish men—

00:46:15.823 --> 00:46:18.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had married pagan women.

00:46:18.358 --> 00:46:20.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read the scripture together

00:46:20.694 --> 00:46:25.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Nehemiah 13:23, 24

00:46:28.435 --> 00:46:31.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Nehemiah 13:23, 24.

00:46:31.572 --> 00:46:35.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “In those days I also saw Jews

00:46:35.642 --> 00:46:38.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who had married Ashdodite, Ammonite,

00:46:38.846 --> 00:46:40.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and Moabite women.

00:46:40.948 --> 00:46:44.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Half of their sons were speaking Ashdodite

00:46:44.184 --> 00:46:46.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and half spoke the language
of the different peoples,

00:46:46.753 --> 00:46:48.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but none of them

00:46:48.755 --> 00:46:52.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knew how to speak the language of the Jews.”

00:46:53.927 --> 00:46:58.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as was stated,
it’s very likely that those mothers

00:46:58.031 --> 00:47:00.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be teaching the children

00:47:00.267 --> 00:47:02.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about their land, their culture,

00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:05.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their worship,
and the pagan gods they worshipped.

00:47:05.672 --> 00:47:08.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so the decision was made

00:47:08.408 --> 00:47:10.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the Jews themselves,

00:47:10.544 --> 00:47:13.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they were counseled and given direction

00:47:13.013 --> 00:47:15.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Ezra and from Nehemiah,

00:47:15.382 --> 00:47:20.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to send those wives away
along with the children.

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:21.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s an interesting thing.

00:47:21.488 --> 00:47:23.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It must have been a bit difficult

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:26.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for some husbands to see
their children sent away.

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:30.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But all they knew were
the languages of the pagan wives

00:47:30.264 --> 00:47:33.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—nothing about Hebrew
and the worship of Jehovah God.

00:47:33.634 --> 00:47:36.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the problem was
that they were sent away to keep the Jews

00:47:36.904 --> 00:47:41.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from losing their identity
by a gradual assimilation into the cultures

00:47:41.508 --> 00:47:46.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the religions of the surrounding nations
that those wives belonged to.

00:47:47.948 --> 00:47:51.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Nehemiah’s day, speaking Hebrew was vital,

00:47:51.718 --> 00:47:54.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re grateful it’s not necessary today.

00:47:54.788 --> 00:47:56.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all don’t have to learn Hebrew.

00:47:56.890 --> 00:48:01.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in his wisdom, Jehovah
invites people who speak any language

00:48:01.495 --> 00:48:06.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn the “pure language,”
the truth about him and his purposes.

00:48:06.333 --> 00:48:09.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, you know, it’s a bit like the opposite

00:48:09.202 --> 00:48:11.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what took place at the Tower of Babel,

00:48:11.905 --> 00:48:16.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Jehovah intervened and confused
the builders of the Tower of Babel,

00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:20.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imposing upon them different languages,
including different ways of thinking.

00:48:20.747 --> 00:48:25.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so they went off disorganized
and separated from one another.

00:48:25.285 --> 00:48:28.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And today, we have people
from all over the world

00:48:28.055 --> 00:48:30.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who speak many, many different languages,

00:48:30.057 --> 00:48:32.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in Jehovah’s wisdom,

00:48:32.159 --> 00:48:34.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s bringing them all together

00:48:34.161 --> 00:48:37.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—those who love the truth and love him—
in unity.

00:48:37.864 --> 00:48:41.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is what Zephaniah says
—Zephaniah 3:9.

00:48:41.969 --> 00:48:44.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It speaks of the “pure language”:

00:48:44.805 --> 00:48:49.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I shall give to peoples
the change to a pure language,

00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:52.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order for them all
to call upon the name of Jehovah.”

00:48:52.846 --> 00:48:55.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what these people do
who speak other languages.

00:48:55.382 --> 00:48:58.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We reach them with the truth,
but then they’re unified

00:48:58.118 --> 00:49:00.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah’s organization,

00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:03.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it goes on to say
“in order to serve him

00:49:03.457 --> 00:49:05.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shoulder to shoulder.”

00:49:05.759 --> 00:49:10.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So isn’t that interesting—the way Jehovah
has used the “pure language”

00:49:10.397 --> 00:49:13.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to bring people of many diverse backgrounds

00:49:13.133 --> 00:49:15.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and languages together in his worship?

00:49:17.037 --> 00:49:19.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our day,
people of many different languages

00:49:19.439 --> 00:49:22.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are leaving their home countries
to live elsewhere.

00:49:22.275 --> 00:49:24.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s really quite amazing
when you consider:

00:49:24.978 --> 00:49:27.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Large cities are filled with people

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:30.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of different languages,
and even in little villages,

00:49:30.384 --> 00:49:33.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we find people speaking different languages.

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:36.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They need help to learn the truth

00:49:36.823 --> 00:49:38.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the language of their heart.

00:49:42.162 --> 00:49:44.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s interesting to note how many Bethelites

00:49:44.931 --> 00:49:49.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have learned other languages
in order to teach the truth to people.

00:49:49.403 --> 00:49:53.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the United States Bethel, in our branch,

00:49:53.407 --> 00:49:57.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are over 2,500 Bethelites

00:49:57.444 --> 00:50:00.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are engaged

00:50:00.547 --> 00:50:03.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 24 different language groups
and congregations.

00:50:03.984 --> 00:50:08.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So a lot of Bethelites (and commuters
are included in those numbers)

00:50:08.255 --> 00:50:10.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are doing a very fine work

00:50:10.357 --> 00:50:13.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in helping people
in the territory to learn the truth.

00:50:13.827 --> 00:50:17.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And wouldn’t it be nice— I know some of us
would love to learn some other languages

00:50:17.764 --> 00:50:20.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—wouldn’t it be lovely
if we could learn the way a child does?

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:22.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They just absorb it
—no effort—

00:50:22.969 --> 00:50:24.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they start speaking it.

00:50:24.971 --> 00:50:28.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A researcher, Dr. John Brierley, says this:

00:50:28.475 --> 00:50:30.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Clearly the young brain seems

00:50:30.744 --> 00:50:33.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to be programmed almost like a computer’ 

00:50:33.246 --> 00:50:35.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for language development.

00:50:35.248 --> 00:50:38.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He notes that even ‘brain anatomy’ suggests

00:50:38.452 --> 00:50:40.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘that an infant is born

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:45.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a pre-programmed
biological capacity to speak.’”

00:50:45.125 --> 00:50:48.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then the comment in <i>Awake!</i>  said

00:50:48.061 --> 00:50:50.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it’s as though the brain is hardwired

00:50:50.864 --> 00:50:52.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn language.

00:50:52.966 --> 00:50:56.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sorry to say that as the years go by,

00:50:56.403 --> 00:51:00.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the hardwiring starts
to fray a bit in many of us.

00:51:02.876 --> 00:51:06.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we make the effort 

00:51:06.113 --> 00:51:10.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we do make a switch to a congregation
where they speak the language

00:51:10.717 --> 00:51:14.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you would like to learn, remember this:

00:51:14.121 --> 00:51:16.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Children can be
a big help in the congregation

00:51:16.323 --> 00:51:18.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you attend in a foreign language.

00:51:19.426 --> 00:51:22.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They can also be very startling and frank:

00:51:22.162 --> 00:51:24.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You speak funny.

00:51:24.197 --> 00:51:27.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why can’t you pronounce that word properly?

00:51:27.234 --> 00:51:28.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s so easy.”

00:51:28.535 --> 00:51:30.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, yes, to <i>you </i> it’s easy.

00:51:30.137 --> 00:51:31.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were raised with it.’

00:51:31.705 --> 00:51:33.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s how kids are.

00:51:33.473 --> 00:51:35.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They don’t realize the difficulties we have 

00:51:35.842 --> 00:51:38.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we get older, 
with the grooves being so deep

00:51:38.345 --> 00:51:41.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so thick in the brain
with our original language

00:51:41.014 --> 00:51:44.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it’s hard to get out
of those grooves the vowels and consonants

00:51:44.818 --> 00:51:48.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re not used 
to saying in a certain order.

00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:53.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep a sense of humor; listen to the kids.

00:51:53.093 --> 00:51:54.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ll help you.

00:51:54.427 --> 00:51:56.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And don’t be overly concerned

00:51:56.963 --> 00:51:59.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about speaking a new language
without an accent.

00:52:01.168 --> 00:52:04.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everybody has an accent one way or another.

00:52:04.271 --> 00:52:07.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some are more agreeable than others,
but everyone has that.

00:52:07.707 --> 00:52:10.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some don’t want to admit it,
but they really do.

00:52:10.644 --> 00:52:11.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have an accent.

00:52:11.978 --> 00:52:15.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even when we all speak the same language,
you can tell where a person is from

00:52:15.615 --> 00:52:19.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—whether it’s east, north, west
(whatever it may be), south.

00:52:19.553 --> 00:52:23.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are accents or intonations
in the way words are pronounced.

00:52:23.590 --> 00:52:25.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember, in years gone by,
for missionaries

00:52:25.926 --> 00:52:28.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were sent out into the field,

00:52:28.094 --> 00:52:31.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had to follow a special program
in learning a new language.

00:52:31.631 --> 00:52:33.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your first month in your new assignment,

00:52:33.767 --> 00:52:36.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you had to study 11 hours a day

00:52:36.403 --> 00:52:39.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for 30 days your new language.

00:52:39.239 --> 00:52:42.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you felt like you were
in the Tower of Babel

00:52:42.042 --> 00:52:44.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on those occasions
because it was very difficult.

00:52:44.744 --> 00:52:47.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second month,
you had to study your new language

00:52:47.347 --> 00:52:50.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
four hours a day
and be out preaching 130 hours.

00:52:50.951 --> 00:52:54.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your third month
was 150 hours in the field ministry,

00:52:54.254 --> 00:52:56.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’d study the language as you could.

00:52:57.991 --> 00:53:00.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For those who are striving
to learn a new language,

00:53:00.427 --> 00:53:04.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here are a few suggestions I gleaned
from the <i>Awake!</i>  of March 2007

00:53:04.798 --> 00:53:08.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the January issue of 2000.

00:53:08.134 --> 00:53:10.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are four points:

00:53:10.136 --> 00:53:12.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) motivation,

00:53:12.138 --> 00:53:14.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) humility,

00:53:14.207 --> 00:53:16.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(3) patience,

00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:18.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(4) practice. 

00:53:18.311 --> 00:53:20.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>“Motivation.</i>

00:53:20.113 --> 00:53:23.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You need an incentive
—a reason to pursue your goal.”

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:26.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because if you have
a high level of motivation,

00:53:26.419 --> 00:53:28.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re going to be more successful.

00:53:28.455 --> 00:53:30.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we have the best motivation there is:

00:53:30.657 --> 00:53:33.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
teach people the truth;
praise our God, Jehovah;

00:53:33.793 --> 00:53:37.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
build up the congregation
we’ve chosen to attend.

00:53:37.163 --> 00:53:39.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about humility?

00:53:39.633 --> 00:53:44.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, “don’t expect too much of yourself”
when you start learning a new language.

00:53:44.671 --> 00:53:46.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Mistakes are inevitable.”

00:53:46.673 --> 00:53:49.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you wait
until you can speak it perfectly

00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:53.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before you start making
comments or give a talk,

00:53:53.146 --> 00:53:55.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you may be waiting quite a while.

00:53:55.515 --> 00:53:57.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be prepared, because it may not be

00:53:57.951 --> 00:54:00.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until after Armageddon
that you achieve that goal.

00:54:00.987 --> 00:54:05.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So don’t be afraid to make mistakes
and carry on with your new language.

00:54:05.926 --> 00:54:07.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>‘Patience.</i>

00:54:07.928 --> 00:54:11.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘A brother stated: “For me,
the first two years were difficult,

00:54:11.398 --> 00:54:13.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and at times I felt like giving up.”

00:54:13.667 --> 00:54:15.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Still, he acknowledges

00:54:15.902 --> 00:54:19.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it does get easier as time goes by.’

00:54:19.039 --> 00:54:21.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it gets enjoyable.

00:54:21.041 --> 00:54:23.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And number four: <i>“Practice.</i>

00:54:23.576 --> 00:54:28.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A regular routine will help you
to become fluent in [your] new language.

00:54:28.481 --> 00:54:31.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Try to practice every day,
even if it’s for just a few minutes.

00:54:31.584 --> 00:54:34.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[There’s an interesting saying]
As one textbook puts it,

00:54:34.688 --> 00:54:37.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“A little and often”

00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:40.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is preferable to “a lot but seldom.”’”

00:54:40.994 --> 00:54:42.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So be steady,

00:54:42.996 --> 00:54:46.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even for short periods of time,
in practicing the new language.

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:49.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the fact is
that most Bethelites in our branch

00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:52.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are serving in the English-language field,

00:54:52.439 --> 00:54:56.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they are truly a blessing
to their congregations.

00:54:56.276 --> 00:55:00.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers are happy
to have Bethelites who take the lead,

00:55:00.447 --> 00:55:04.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who give of themselves, and who work hard
to build up the congregation.

00:55:04.617 --> 00:55:07.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the decision to serve
in an English congregation

00:55:07.988 --> 00:55:12.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or with a different language group
is highly personal.

00:55:12.425 --> 00:55:16.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever the decision may be,
there’s a key factor

00:55:16.029 --> 00:55:18.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we all have to keep in mind

00:55:18.331 --> 00:55:21.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to maintain our spirituality at a high level 

00:55:21.534 --> 00:55:25.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and give our Bethel assignment our best.

00:55:25.205 --> 00:55:28.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that key factor
that we have to keep in mind

00:55:28.208 --> 00:55:32.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to focus on the one language
that counts the most

00:55:32.545 --> 00:55:37.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the “pure language” that Jehovah God
has given to his people.

00:55:38.651 --> 00:55:40.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we noted earlier,

00:55:40.687 --> 00:55:44.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can expect stormy tests

00:55:44.124 --> 00:55:46.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and trials to come our way.

00:55:46.726 --> 00:55:50.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we’ve built fire-resistant materials

00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:53.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our children, our students, and ourselves

00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:56.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we will stand firm.

00:55:56.302 --> 00:56:01.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see that in our
beautiful new music video.

00:56:10.984 --> 00:56:17.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first time I heard
the word of truth

00:56:18.892 --> 00:56:25.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About Jehovah
and a world that is new,

00:56:25.999 --> 00:56:32.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Love grew in my heart
right up to this day.

00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:39.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I know this world
wants to pull me away.

00:56:43.683 --> 00:56:49.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I cannot lose sight.

00:56:51.658 --> 00:56:56.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to do what is right.

00:56:57.297 --> 00:57:02.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll keep building my faith
so I can be strong.

00:57:02.102 --> 00:57:06.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will not give up
or give in.

00:57:06.139 --> 00:57:10.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His Word as my guide
I’ll follow each day.

00:57:10.477 --> 00:57:14.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll pray to stand firm
on the ground.

00:57:14.114 --> 00:57:20.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll keep building my faith;
I won’t stop now.

00:57:26.826 --> 00:57:33.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have to choose
where we will stand:

00:57:34.434 --> 00:57:39.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A life built on rock
or one built on sand.

00:57:41.508 --> 00:57:46.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This world around us
wants us to believe

00:57:48.848 --> 00:57:54.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will stand forever,
so live and be free.

00:57:59.592 --> 00:58:03.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we know the truth,

00:58:07.467 --> 00:58:12.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What the Kingdom will do.

00:58:12.805 --> 00:58:17.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s keep building our faith
so we can be strong.

00:58:17.810 --> 00:58:21.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will not give up
or give in.

00:58:21.514 --> 00:58:26.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His Word as our guide
we’ll follow each day.

00:58:26.386 --> 00:58:29.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll pray to stand firm
on the ground.

00:58:29.956 --> 00:58:36.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s keep building our faith;
we won’t stop now.

00:58:50.143 --> 00:58:55.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s keep building our faith
so we can be strong.

00:58:55.715 --> 00:58:58.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will not give up
or give in.

00:58:58.851 --> 00:59:03.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His Word as our guide
we’ll follow each day.

00:59:03.923 --> 00:59:07.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll pray to stand firm
on the ground.

00:59:07.527 --> 00:59:13.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s keep building our faith;
we won’t stop now.

00:59:15.835 --> 00:59:17.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We won’t stop now.

00:59:19.939 --> 00:59:24.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We won’t stop now.

00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:36.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an encouraging song!

00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:41.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to further help you 
stand firm against trials,

00:59:41.027 --> 00:59:43.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a new video will be released

00:59:43.363 --> 00:59:46.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
later this month entitled 

00:59:46.032 --> 00:59:49.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Firm Under Opposition.</i>

00:59:49.135 --> 00:59:52.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This 10-minute video consists of segments

00:59:52.338 --> 00:59:55.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from two previous documentaries

00:59:55.074 --> 00:59:57.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that touched the hearts of many: 

00:59:57.610 --> 01:00:02.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Jehovah’s Witnesses Stand Firm</i>
<i>Against Nazi Assault</i>

01:00:02.282 --> 01:00:05.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and <i>Faithful Under Trials</i>

01:00:05.318 --> 01:00:08.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>—Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Soviet Union.</i>

01:00:09.122 --> 01:00:13.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So please look for this video
that combines the highlights

01:00:13.526 --> 01:00:16.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the two previous programs.

01:00:16.329 --> 01:00:18.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will strengthen

01:00:18.398 --> 01:00:21.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help you remain faithful to Jehovah.

01:00:23.803 --> 01:00:26.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The theme of this month’s program was

01:00:26.973 --> 01:00:30.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let Each One Keep Watching
How He Is Building.”

01:00:31.577 --> 01:00:35.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw how first-time parents

01:00:35.214 --> 01:00:39.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can successfully embrace
their new responsibilities.

01:00:40.219 --> 01:00:43.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By setting a good example, Rudy and Nenita

01:00:43.122 --> 01:00:46.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped their three daughters
reach meaningful, spiritual goals.

01:00:48.628 --> 01:00:51.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Louise received
fine training from her parents,

01:00:51.998 --> 01:00:55.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which has helped her
to enjoy a fulfilling life.

01:00:58.137 --> 01:00:59.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cecilio and Schera

01:00:59.639 --> 01:01:02.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made sacrifices to be effective 

01:01:02.141 --> 01:01:04.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bible teachers, and their efforts made

01:01:04.844 --> 01:01:08.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a real difference
in the lives of their students.

01:01:10.049 --> 01:01:12.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before we close,

01:01:12.218 --> 01:01:15.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s visit our brothers 
and sisters in Nigeria.

01:01:17.490 --> 01:01:21.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nigeria is
the most populous country in Africa.

01:01:21.127 --> 01:01:23.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Its some 200 million people

01:01:23.596 --> 01:01:26.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
speak over 500 languages.

01:01:26.599 --> 01:01:29.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than 400,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses

01:01:29.802 --> 01:01:31.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
live and preach there.

01:01:31.871 --> 01:01:36.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many publishers come
from other lands to share in the ministry.

01:01:36.609 --> 01:01:40.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The response to the good news
is very encouraging.

01:01:40.913 --> 01:01:44.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than 870,000 Bible studies

01:01:44.650 --> 01:01:46.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are conducted every month.

01:01:46.819 --> 01:01:51.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On average, about 40 people
are baptized every day,

01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:53.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seven new congregations

01:01:53.326 --> 01:01:55.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are formed every month.

01:01:56.696 --> 01:01:59.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the Obudu Ranch Congregation.

01:01:59.632 --> 01:02:04.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their territory is beautiful,
vast, and mountainous

01:02:04.303 --> 01:02:06.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—literally in the clouds.

01:02:06.372 --> 01:02:08.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Twenty-three publishers,

01:02:08.374 --> 01:02:12.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including two special pioneers, serve here.

01:02:12.879 --> 01:02:16.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To reach areas only accessible by foot,

01:02:16.516 --> 01:02:19.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the publishers
sometimes walk for eight hours.

01:02:19.852 --> 01:02:23.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The terrain is challenging,
but the long walk 

01:02:23.489 --> 01:02:26.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provides opportunities
for upbuilding association.

01:02:27.827 --> 01:02:29.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After working the territory, our brothers

01:02:29.929 --> 01:02:32.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stay overnight and walk back

01:02:32.565 --> 01:02:34.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
another eight hours.

01:02:36.502 --> 01:02:39.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters
in the Obudu Ranch Congregation

01:02:39.071 --> 01:02:42.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
send their warm love and greetings!

01:02:43.976 --> 01:02:46.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:02:46.446 --> 01:02:49.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
