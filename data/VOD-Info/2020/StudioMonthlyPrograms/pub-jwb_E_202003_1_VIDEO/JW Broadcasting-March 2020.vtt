00:00:01.851 --> 00:00:04.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome to our program.

00:00:04.487 --> 00:00:08.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our focus this month is baptism.

00:00:08.024 --> 00:00:11.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does a person progress from Bible student

00:00:11.861 --> 00:00:14.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to baptized Christian?

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll hear from many

00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who successfully completed the journey.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes as students gain Bible knowledge,

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they realize they need to make
a major change in their life.

00:00:27.243 --> 00:00:29.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the case with this brother.

00:00:29.746 --> 00:00:32.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see how he met the challenge.

00:00:34.184 --> 00:00:38.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our new music video
beautifully shows the joy experienced

00:00:38.021 --> 00:00:42.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by those who dedicate their life to Jehovah.

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:46.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the March 2020 edition
of JW Broadcasting®.

00:01:04.681 --> 00:01:06.683 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Imagine for a moment

00:01:06.683 --> 00:01:08.685 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that you’re planning a road trip.

00:01:08.685 --> 00:01:10.687 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You have everything you need:

00:01:10.687 --> 00:01:14.958 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a map, a car, and plenty of fuel.

00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before you start the engine, though,

00:01:17.427 --> 00:01:20.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you need to know your destination
—wouldn’t you agree?

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you don’t know where you are trying to go,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you won’t know which road to take.

00:01:26.102 --> 00:01:28.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same is true of our ministry,

00:01:28.805 --> 00:01:32.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is, in a sense, like that road trip.

00:01:32.275 --> 00:01:37.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Acts 13:48 shows, we’re always searching

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for “those who [are] rightly disposed
for everlasting life.”

00:01:41.151 --> 00:01:43.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have everything we need for the journey,

00:01:43.753 --> 00:01:47.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including all the tools
in our Teaching Toolbox.

00:01:47.924 --> 00:01:51.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what would you say is our destination?

00:01:51.928 --> 00:01:54.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the most important goal

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:57.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we are trying
to accomplish in our ministry?

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it placing literature?

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
directing people to jw.org®?

00:02:04.107 --> 00:02:07.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making return visits?

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
starting Bible studies?

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:13.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
educating people about the Bible?

00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:18.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or making disciples
of Christ Jesus and baptizing them?

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each of those goals has value.

00:02:22.192 --> 00:02:25.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But which one is our primary goal?

00:02:25.495 --> 00:02:29.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the destination that we want to reach?

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:31.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus identified it

00:02:31.334 --> 00:02:35.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Matthew 28:19, 20.

00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:37.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There he said:

00:02:37.273 --> 00:02:40.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go, therefore, and make disciples

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of people of all the nations,
baptizing them in the name

00:02:45.515 --> 00:02:49.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of the Father and
of the Son and of the holy spirit,

00:02:49.853 --> 00:02:53.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“teaching them to observe all the things

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:55.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have commanded you.”

00:02:55.925 --> 00:03:00.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our destination, then,
is a baptized disciple.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each person we meet,

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:06.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each piece of literature that we place,

00:03:06.536 --> 00:03:10.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each time we direct attention to the website,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each return visit we make,

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:15.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each Bible study we conduct

00:03:15.812 --> 00:03:18.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we should have the final goal

00:03:18.014 --> 00:03:22.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of making a baptized disciple.

00:03:22.318 --> 00:03:25.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is baptism essential?

00:03:25.722 --> 00:03:29.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Put simply, it’s because baptism

00:03:29.058 --> 00:03:31.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is necessary for salvation.

00:03:31.761 --> 00:03:33.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what the Bible tells us

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Peter 3:21:

00:03:39.502 --> 00:03:43.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Baptism . . . is also now saving you

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:46.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“(not by the removing
of the filth of the flesh,

00:03:46.542 --> 00:03:50.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but by the request to God
for a good conscience),

00:03:50.847 --> 00:03:53.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.”

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So from the time
we meet an interested person,

00:03:58.554 --> 00:04:01.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to have our eyes on that goal

00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:05.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of making a baptized disciple.

00:04:05.028 --> 00:04:09.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, the November 1977 <i>Kingdom Ministry </i>

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:12.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made this statement
regarding those we study with:

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:15.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Our discussions should reflect

00:04:15.805 --> 00:04:19.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a genuine <i>personal </i> interest in the student

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:23.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as a potential disciple and therefore

00:04:23.413 --> 00:04:27.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a potential brother or sister in the faith.”

00:04:28.117 --> 00:04:30.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we don’t have that end-point

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:34.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a baptized disciple fixed firmly in mind,

00:04:34.857 --> 00:04:38.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could end up stuck on side roads.

00:04:38.461 --> 00:04:40.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, watch this video,

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see if you can identify
the problem that our brother has.

00:04:48.404 --> 00:04:50.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you going out
in field service after lunch?

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, I’m going to be there, but I’ve got
one return visit that I’ve got to make.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:54.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, see you.

00:04:54.477 --> 00:04:55.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See you.

00:05:02.752 --> 00:05:05.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My neighbor lost his job after 20 years,

00:05:05.688 --> 00:05:08.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as a result,
he’s got to move out of his house,

00:05:08.825 --> 00:05:10.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
got to move into an apartment.

00:05:10.827 --> 00:05:13.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I decided to go help him out a little bit

00:05:13.463 --> 00:05:17.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pack up to make it a little easier
for him to make that move.

00:05:19.302 --> 00:05:21.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know,
won’t it be nice at a time period

00:05:21.771 --> 00:05:24.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we don’t have to worry
about economic troubles like that?

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, it will.

00:05:25.875 --> 00:05:28.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uhm, you know,
that’s why I’m so happy

00:05:28.111 --> 00:05:31.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that my grandchildren
chose to go for higher education.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They both landed good jobs.

00:05:33.383 --> 00:05:35.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know that bridge
you cross when you come here.

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:37.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve noticed that they’re starting
to do some work on it.

00:05:37.553 --> 00:05:39.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s pretty extensive work.

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:40.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re going to replace that whole bridge.

00:05:40.957 --> 00:05:42.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So according to the newspaper article,

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:44.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s going to be
like a six to eight month project.

00:05:44.927 --> 00:05:46.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!
That is a long time.

00:05:46.195 --> 00:05:48.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uhm, you know, Chris,

00:05:48.197 --> 00:05:50.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the reason why I came by
is I wanted to show you this magazine.

00:05:50.833 --> 00:05:53.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love these.
These are so well written.

00:05:54.637 --> 00:05:56.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 48:17 is a key scripture here.

00:05:56.873 --> 00:05:58.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what it says:

00:05:58.508 --> 00:06:00.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I, Jehovah, am your God,

00:06:00.543 --> 00:06:04.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the One teaching you to benefit yourself.”

00:06:05.014 --> 00:06:06.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s familiar.

00:06:06.215 --> 00:06:08.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think your dad
read that to me once or twice.

00:06:08.885 --> 00:06:10.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How’s your dad doing anyway?

00:06:10.686 --> 00:06:11.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doing good.

00:06:11.687 --> 00:06:13.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, you know,
they said they’ve got more Bible studies

00:06:13.756 --> 00:06:15.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than they can even cover in one week.

00:06:15.825 --> 00:06:19.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, well, you know, I can remember
when you and your dad came here.

00:06:19.562 --> 00:06:21.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were a little kid about this high,

00:06:21.731 --> 00:06:23.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you just stayed right by his side.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And your dad was so proud.

00:06:26.035 --> 00:06:29.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, Chris,
I know my dad had offered

00:06:29.505 --> 00:06:31.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to study the Bible with you in the past.

00:06:31.507 --> 00:06:34.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John, to be honest,

00:06:34.277 --> 00:06:36.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m too old to change;

00:06:36.345 --> 00:06:38.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m set in my ways now.

00:06:38.414 --> 00:06:42.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think that God is just going
to have to take me the way I am.

00:06:43.886 --> 00:06:45.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More chocolate?

00:06:45.388 --> 00:06:47.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uhm, yeah.
I don’t mind.

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:53.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could you identify
with the brother in that video?

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:55.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever had a return visit with someone

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:57.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who just loves your company?

00:06:57.867 --> 00:07:01.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps you’ve been leaving literature
with that person for months

00:07:01.437 --> 00:07:04.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even years—
and yet the person

00:07:04.073 --> 00:07:08.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has no genuine interest in progressing.

00:07:08.111 --> 00:07:10.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is that a problem?

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Apparently, the person isn’t interested

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:17.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in becoming a disciple of Christ Jesus.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our time would be better spent
searching for other people

00:07:21.757 --> 00:07:26.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are “rightly disposed
for everlasting life.”

00:07:26.429 --> 00:07:29.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, that doesn’t mean
that there’s no value

00:07:29.932 --> 00:07:33.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in placing literature
or leaving contact cards

00:07:33.603 --> 00:07:36.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that direct people to jw.org.

00:07:36.472 --> 00:07:41.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These provisions are part
of our Teaching Toolbox for a reason.

00:07:41.477 --> 00:07:45.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They can play a vital role
in reaching the hearts

00:07:45.281 --> 00:07:48.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those who are “rightly disposed.”

00:07:48.017 --> 00:07:51.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So continue to make good use of these tools

00:07:51.921 --> 00:07:55.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah’s organization provides.

00:07:55.057 --> 00:07:59.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the same time,
never lose sight of your goal

00:07:59.595 --> 00:08:02.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to start Bible studies with interested ones

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:05.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and then the ultimate goal:

00:08:05.101 --> 00:08:09.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “make disciples . . . , baptizing them.”

00:08:09.305 --> 00:08:13.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about a person
you’ve been studying with for years,

00:08:13.442 --> 00:08:16.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the person isn’t making changes,

00:08:16.445 --> 00:08:18.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hasn’t stopped going to church,

00:08:18.648 --> 00:08:23.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and shows no real interest
in attending Christian meetings?

00:08:23.152 --> 00:08:26.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some people are glad
to study the Bible with us

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:30.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
simply for the fact
that they value Bible education.

00:08:30.426 --> 00:08:34.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we love to teach people about the Bible.

00:08:34.096 --> 00:08:39.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we have to remember
that providing Bible education

00:08:39.035 --> 00:08:43.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for its own sake is not our primary goal.

00:08:43.506 --> 00:08:47.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, it could be a side road.

00:08:47.243 --> 00:08:49.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact is,

00:08:49.312 --> 00:08:52.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some people who value Bible education

00:08:52.381 --> 00:08:55.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not interested in becoming

00:08:55.051 --> 00:08:58.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
baptized disciples of Jesus.

00:08:58.521 --> 00:09:01.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world is full of Bible scholars

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are highly educated in the Bible

00:09:04.527 --> 00:09:09.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but who do not become
disciples of Christ Jesus.

00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:13.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, one Bible scholar was educated

00:09:13.336 --> 00:09:17.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at a Bible institute, a religious college,

00:09:17.073 --> 00:09:19.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a theological seminary.

00:09:19.875 --> 00:09:23.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He holds a doctorate in religious studies.

00:09:23.746 --> 00:09:27.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has a thorough knowledge
of Biblical Greek,

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s written 30 books about the Bible.

00:09:31.754 --> 00:09:34.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, he describes himself

00:09:34.156 --> 00:09:37.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as an “agnostic atheist.”

00:09:37.693 --> 00:09:41.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So just providing Bible education

00:09:41.497 --> 00:09:44.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not our primary goal.

00:09:44.967 --> 00:09:48.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want people to build faith in God

00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:52.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to have
their own relationship with Jehovah

00:09:52.441 --> 00:09:56.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will move them toward the destination

00:09:56.145 --> 00:09:59.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of dedication and baptism.

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:04.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why it’s important to honestly analyze

00:10:04.453 --> 00:10:07.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the progress of our Bible students.

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:10.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are they simply taking in knowledge?

00:10:10.893 --> 00:10:14.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do they prepare in advance for the study?

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:18.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do they answer
in their own words and from their heart?

00:10:18.901 --> 00:10:21.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are they making changes in their life

00:10:21.737 --> 00:10:24.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to conform to what they’ve learned?

00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:29.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are they attending
and benefiting from Christian meetings?

00:10:29.712 --> 00:10:33.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If not, we may need to follow the advice

00:10:33.683 --> 00:10:38.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the <i>Kingdom Ministry</i>
of October 1988, which stated:

00:10:39.722 --> 00:10:43.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If a student is not making
meaningful progress

00:10:43.392 --> 00:10:46.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“after you have patiently aided him

00:10:46.095 --> 00:10:49.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“over a reasonable period of time,

00:10:49.365 --> 00:10:52.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it may be best to use the time

00:10:52.435 --> 00:10:56.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to better advantage
searching for deserving ones.

00:10:56.739 --> 00:10:59.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Depending on the circumstances,

00:10:59.108 --> 00:11:03.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it may be wise to discontinue the study.”

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why is it so important to be selective

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:10.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about who we spend our time with?

00:11:10.286 --> 00:11:13.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t conducting an unproductive study

00:11:13.189 --> 00:11:16.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
better than knocking on doors
where no one is home

00:11:16.492 --> 00:11:18.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or where no one shows interest?

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:22.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To answer that, let’s read Jesus’ words

00:11:22.398 --> 00:11:26.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Matthew 10:11-13.

00:11:26.602 --> 00:11:29.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when instructing his disciples

00:11:29.271 --> 00:11:33.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how to conduct
their ministry, Jesus said:

00:11:33.476 --> 00:11:36.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Into whatever city or village you enter,

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:39.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“search out who in it is deserving,

00:11:39.815 --> 00:11:42.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and stay there until you leave.

00:11:42.918 --> 00:11:46.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When you enter the house,
greet the household.

00:11:46.756 --> 00:11:49.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If the house is deserving,

00:11:49.191 --> 00:11:52.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“let the peace you wish it come upon it;

00:11:52.561 --> 00:11:55.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but if it is not deserving,

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:58.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let the peace from you return upon you.”

00:11:59.335 --> 00:12:01.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In harmony with those verses,

00:12:01.904 --> 00:12:06.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to focus our attention
on deserving ones

00:12:06.375 --> 00:12:08.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Jesus instructed,

00:12:08.444 --> 00:12:13.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people who are
“rightly disposed for everlasting life.”

00:12:13.949 --> 00:12:16.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, there is a balance.

00:12:16.719 --> 00:12:21.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to be patient
with those we call on and study with,

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:25.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not everyone progresses at the same rate.

00:12:25.227 --> 00:12:29.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as we call on people and study with them,

00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:34.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should never lose sight of our goal
—our destination—

00:12:34.236 --> 00:12:38.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “make disciples . . . , baptizing them.”

00:12:38.207 --> 00:12:42.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we have that goal clearly in mind,

00:12:42.111 --> 00:12:45.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll know when we are moving toward it,

00:12:45.748 --> 00:12:49.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll know
when we are getting sidetracked.

00:12:49.318 --> 00:12:51.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could illustrate it like this:

00:12:51.921 --> 00:12:55.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of a plane on a runway.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That plane is like a person you’ve visited

00:12:58.561 --> 00:13:03.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you believe shows
sincere interest in the Bible’s message.

00:13:03.566 --> 00:13:06.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your short-term goal at this point

00:13:06.502 --> 00:13:10.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to get them off the runway
and into a Bible study.

00:13:10.806 --> 00:13:15.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you do, that means
the plane has taken off.

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:18.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But once your study is airborne,

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have to keep
your sights on your destination.

00:13:21.817 --> 00:13:25.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t just stay in the air indefinitely.

00:13:25.321 --> 00:13:29.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your goal is to make a baptized disciple.

00:13:29.992 --> 00:13:32.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If, in a reasonable amount of time,

00:13:32.828 --> 00:13:36.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the student isn’t progressing,
what will you do?

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:41.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To keep the study going
would be like flying in circles.

00:13:41.904 --> 00:13:45.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the same way, a Bible study

00:13:45.207 --> 00:13:49.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s simply suspended
in the air goes nowhere.

00:13:49.345 --> 00:13:51.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to land the plane

00:13:51.947 --> 00:13:55.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—either at the destination
of a baptized disciple

00:13:55.851 --> 00:13:58.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or at the termination of the study.

00:14:00.623 --> 00:14:04.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if something is holding
your Bible student back

00:14:04.093 --> 00:14:06.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the destination of baptism

00:14:06.729 --> 00:14:10.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maybe an attachment to holiday celebrations

00:14:10.132 --> 00:14:13.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or an unclean habit, like smoking?

00:14:13.869 --> 00:14:18.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how this issue arises
in the following brief video.

00:14:19.408 --> 00:14:21.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I started studying the Bible,

00:14:21.343 --> 00:14:24.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were various factors
that hindered my study.

00:14:24.914 --> 00:14:27.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was a truck driver,
and I was on the road a lot.

00:14:27.683 --> 00:14:30.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had the worst kind
of friendships,

00:14:30.419 --> 00:14:31.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I smoked.

00:14:31.921 --> 00:14:35.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I smoked, on average, 60 cigarettes a day.

00:14:35.391 --> 00:14:38.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that if I
was going to make the needed adjustments,

00:14:38.694 --> 00:14:40.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to change my profession.

00:14:40.696 --> 00:14:42.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I changed my job.

00:14:42.698 --> 00:14:45.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if I wanted to get baptized,
I had to stop smoking.

00:14:47.069 --> 00:14:49.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I cut down to two or three cigarettes a day.

00:14:51.206 --> 00:14:53.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, I bought a single cigarette.

00:14:55.611 --> 00:14:57.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lit it, and I prayed to Jehovah.

00:14:57.613 --> 00:15:01.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I begged him to help me,

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he did help me

00:15:03.452 --> 00:15:06.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so much so that I never smoked again.

00:15:06.155 --> 00:15:08.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to this day,
I don’t even have the urge to smoke.

00:15:10.526 --> 00:15:14.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ten years after my first Bible study,
I was baptized.

00:15:15.464 --> 00:15:17.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve been serving Jehovah for 20 years now,

00:15:17.566 --> 00:15:19.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with my wife and all my children.

00:15:21.971 --> 00:15:25.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice this man
had to pray to Jehovah

00:15:25.541 --> 00:15:29.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get the help he needed
to overcome smoking?

00:15:29.511 --> 00:15:32.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, he had to cultivate

00:15:32.314 --> 00:15:35.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his own relationship with Jehovah

00:15:35.584 --> 00:15:40.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to build the faith
he needed to stop smoking.

00:15:40.289 --> 00:15:44.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the same way, we need to help our students

00:15:44.009 --> 00:15:47.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build their own relationship with Jehovah

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:51.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they’ll also overcome any obstacles

00:15:51.216 --> 00:15:55.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that might hold them back
from progressing to baptism.

00:15:55.988 --> 00:16:00.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if you’re not
presently conducting a Bible study?

00:16:00.926 --> 00:16:03.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if you’ve never had the privilege

00:16:03.228 --> 00:16:06.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of having one
of your Bible students get baptized?

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:11.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does that mean your service
to Jehovah is not valuable?

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not at all.

00:16:13.339 --> 00:16:17.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, we each
do our part in the ministry.

00:16:17.543 --> 00:16:20.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember what the apostle Paul said

00:16:20.546 --> 00:16:22.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Corinthians 3:6, 7:

00:16:24.516 --> 00:16:28.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I planted, Apollos watered,

00:16:28.487 --> 00:16:31.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but God kept making it grow,

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:35.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that neither is
the one who plants anything

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor is the one who waters,

00:16:37.296 --> 00:16:40.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but God who makes it grow.”

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:46.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So never feel
that your efforts are unimportant.

00:16:46.138 --> 00:16:48.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as Paul said,

00:16:48.307 --> 00:16:52.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what’s accomplished
in the ministry is a group effort.

00:16:52.144 --> 00:16:54.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a person reaches baptism,

00:16:54.713 --> 00:16:56.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it isn’t just because of the effort

00:16:56.782 --> 00:16:59.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the person who conducted the study.

00:16:59.952 --> 00:17:02.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The efforts of others played a role.

00:17:02.921 --> 00:17:06.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps someone else
initiated that person’s interest

00:17:06.358 --> 00:17:10.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by placing literature
or in some other way

00:17:10.262 --> 00:17:12.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
giving a witness.

00:17:13.365 --> 00:17:15.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But remember what Paul said.

00:17:15.834 --> 00:17:19.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is the one “who makes it grow.”

00:17:19.438 --> 00:17:22.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is the one that is drawing to himself

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:27.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those who are “rightly disposed
for everlasting life.”

00:17:27.679 --> 00:17:30.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a privilege we have

00:17:30.849 --> 00:17:33.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be fellow workers with Jehovah

00:17:33.452 --> 00:17:38.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we help people
become disciples of Christ Jesus!

00:17:38.357 --> 00:17:41.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we keep that goal clearly in mind,

00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:44.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how will it help us?

00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:48.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We won’t be content just to place literature

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or just to direct interest to jw.org.

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:53.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We won’t be satisfied

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:57.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just making return visits
or starting Bible studies.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:02.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll always have in mind
our primary destination

00:18:02.448 --> 00:18:05.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—making disciples of Christ

00:18:05.584 --> 00:18:08.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and baptizing them.

00:18:08.287 --> 00:18:10.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We of the Governing Body

00:18:10.989 --> 00:18:14.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wish you Jehovah’s rich blessing

00:18:14.159 --> 00:18:17.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you work shoulder to shoulder with us

00:18:17.429 --> 00:18:20.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in helping “rightly disposed” ones

00:18:20.399 --> 00:18:24.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
become baptized disciples of Jesus.

00:18:26.405 --> 00:18:31.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our first video,
we’ll hear from several brothers and sisters

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:34.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how they progressed to baptism.

00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:38.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll learn answers to questions
commonly asked about baptism:

00:18:38.984 --> 00:18:41.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does it take to qualify?

00:18:41.386 --> 00:18:44.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does one need to work on?

00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:47.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the actual day of baptism like?

00:18:47.593 --> 00:18:51.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what blessings
can you expect after baptism?

00:18:52.831 --> 00:18:54.867 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I enjoyed associating

00:18:54.867 --> 00:18:56.268 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:18:56.268 --> 00:18:58.504 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Later, I also started to study the Bible.

00:18:58.504 --> 00:19:00.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that I had to make

00:19:00.305 --> 00:19:02.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
drastic changes in my life,

00:19:02.307 --> 00:19:04.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but my job prevented me from doing so.

00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:08.247 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So I asked myself,

00:19:08.247 --> 00:19:11.034 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‘What would I like to do with my life?’

00:19:12.618 --> 00:19:16.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began studying
the Bible again with the couple

00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:18.290 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and one month later

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:21.144 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
started attending meetings regularly.

00:19:21.994 --> 00:19:24.196 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Since our parents had stopped studying,

00:19:24.196 --> 00:19:27.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only three of us went to the meetings.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.969 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can do a lot with you.

00:19:30.969 --> 00:19:32.237 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah could, you know,

00:19:32.237 --> 00:19:34.373 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
your whole perspective can change.

00:19:34.373 --> 00:19:36.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew if I applied what I learned,

00:19:36.608 --> 00:19:38.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah would not let me down.

00:19:41.547 --> 00:19:43.549 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
To strengthen my relationship with Jehovah,

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:45.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read the Bible daily and I pray.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.422 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My relationship with Jehovah

00:19:50.422 --> 00:19:52.424 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
has gotten stronger.

00:19:52.424 --> 00:19:53.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I pray now,

00:19:53.792 --> 00:19:57.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it feels like I’m talking to my close Friend.

00:19:57.062 --> 00:19:58.497 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Going out in service more—

00:19:58.497 --> 00:20:00.165 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I think it really helped me

00:20:00.165 --> 00:20:01.533 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to draw closer to Jehovah

00:20:01.533 --> 00:20:04.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and make the Kingdom feel real to me.

00:20:04.002 --> 00:20:08.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so that’s why I wanted to get baptized.

00:20:08.273 --> 00:20:11.009 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What a great pleasure it was for me

00:20:11.009 --> 00:20:12.978 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when four months later

00:20:12.978 --> 00:20:15.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could dedicate myself to Jehovah

00:20:15.013 --> 00:20:16.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and get baptized!

00:20:16.782 --> 00:20:19.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That made me so happy.

00:20:21.019 --> 00:20:23.789 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Today is a very, very special day for me,

00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:26.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because today I’m getting baptized.

00:20:28.794 --> 00:20:33.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the regional convention, August 9, 2014,

00:20:35.133 --> 00:20:37.302 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
it was a beautiful day.

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:47.813 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, when I think about my three children

00:20:47.813 --> 00:20:50.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who got baptized today,

00:20:50.382 --> 00:20:53.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel my heart is full of joy,

00:20:53.552 --> 00:20:55.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I really thank Jehovah!

00:20:56.511 --> 00:21:00.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, it’s not a day I don’t go thank Jehovah

00:21:00.192 --> 00:21:02.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for taking me out of the darkness.

00:21:04.196 --> 00:21:07.432 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
If we are determined to be loyal to Jehovah

00:21:07.432 --> 00:21:09.968 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and we have the courage to remain chaste, 

00:21:09.968 --> 00:21:13.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, we won’t have any regrets.

00:21:13.171 --> 00:21:17.175 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
To know that you have a heavenly Father

00:21:17.175 --> 00:21:19.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that cares about you

00:21:19.011 --> 00:21:21.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that was the best feeling on earth.

00:21:24.082 --> 00:21:29.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I often think:
‘God, is it true? Is it real?

00:21:29.087 --> 00:21:32.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do I really deserve to have
all these blessings?’

00:21:35.727 --> 00:21:38.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All these blessings have helped me to see

00:21:38.363 --> 00:21:42.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this life provides
true satisfaction and true happiness.

00:21:44.336 --> 00:21:46.104 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The important quality

00:21:46.104 --> 00:21:48.707 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has taught me is love.

00:21:48.707 --> 00:21:51.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt that love from my family,

00:21:51.209 --> 00:21:53.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Jehovah, and from my friends.

00:21:53.779 --> 00:21:56.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned that it’s OK to love people,

00:21:56.615 --> 00:21:59.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s what you are supposed to do.

00:21:59.051 --> 00:22:01.386 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Working closely with Jehovah,

00:22:01.386 --> 00:22:03.855 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I really feel part of his family.

00:22:03.855 --> 00:22:06.692 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When you give your faith to Jehovah,

00:22:06.692 --> 00:22:08.694 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
you’re giving your life to him.

00:22:08.694 --> 00:22:12.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s permitted these things
to come upon me;

00:22:12.064 --> 00:22:14.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that.

00:22:14.066 --> 00:22:16.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he protected me.

00:22:17.302 --> 00:22:19.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I meditate and think

00:22:19.338 --> 00:22:22.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what Jehovah
has done for me and Lei Lei,

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t have to be afraid.

00:22:24.242 --> 00:22:26.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is my “secure refuge,”

00:22:26.244 --> 00:22:29.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because life may change,
but Jehovah does not change.

00:22:31.717 --> 00:22:34.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Choosing to serve Jehovah

00:22:34.152 --> 00:22:37.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the best decision I have made in my life.

00:22:39.825 --> 00:22:42.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What beautiful expressions!

00:22:42.661 --> 00:22:47.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice
what helps a person qualify for baptism?

00:22:47.232 --> 00:22:51.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s studying the Bible, attending meetings,

00:22:51.937 --> 00:22:56.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
having a share in the ministry, and praying.

00:22:56.007 --> 00:22:59.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was obvious
that these brothers and sisters

00:22:59.644 --> 00:23:04.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were so happy they had made
the decision to get baptized.

00:23:05.851 --> 00:23:10.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For some, the road to baptism
takes much effort.

00:23:10.322 --> 00:23:12.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when that day comes,

00:23:12.624 --> 00:23:16.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it marks a turning point in their life.

00:23:16.027 --> 00:23:18.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see that in our next video.

00:23:19.531 --> 00:23:22.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was born in Dalby, Queensland.

00:23:22.267 --> 00:23:24.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m the youngest of five children,

00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:27.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my mother and father
owned their own piggery.

00:23:27.639 --> 00:23:31.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we lived on a little farm
about ten minutes out of town.

00:23:31.977 --> 00:23:35.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was eight years old,
my parents separated,

00:23:35.881 --> 00:23:38.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which came as a huge shock to me.

00:23:38.016 --> 00:23:43.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was devastating, and the consequences
just seemed to roll on for decades.

00:23:43.021 --> 00:23:47.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would go and stay at the farm
with my father for school holidays,

00:23:47.993 --> 00:23:50.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but my dad abused alcohol

00:23:50.996 --> 00:23:54.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and smoked cigarettes
and used bad language.

00:23:54.332 --> 00:23:56.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So by the time I was a teenager,

00:23:56.835 --> 00:23:59.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was doing exactly the same thing.

00:23:59.204 --> 00:24:03.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my late teens,
I was smoking marijuana every day

00:24:03.375 --> 00:24:05.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I was spending up to four nights a week

00:24:05.944 --> 00:24:08.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at pubs and clubs and parties.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:14.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was addicted to alcohol,
cigarettes, marijuana,

00:24:14.085 --> 00:24:17.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pornography, and I had no power to stop.

00:24:17.756 --> 00:24:20.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, it was only a matter of time

00:24:20.859 --> 00:24:24.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before that lifestyle affected my health.

00:24:24.896 --> 00:24:28.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lost my social skills,
and I became depressed.

00:24:30.735 --> 00:24:32.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The turning point in my life

00:24:32.737 --> 00:24:35.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came one afternoon when two

00:24:35.273 --> 00:24:37.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s Witnesses knocked on my door.

00:24:37.943 --> 00:24:42.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of feeling so lost and so unhappy,

00:24:42.013 --> 00:24:45.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had started to search
for answers and I’d begun looking

00:24:45.884 --> 00:24:48.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at New Age teachings.

00:24:48.587 --> 00:24:53.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The timing felt too remarkable
to be just coincidence.

00:24:53.124 --> 00:24:56.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really felt like God
wanted me to take the book.

00:24:58.597 --> 00:25:00.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never looked at New Age teachings again.

00:25:00.866 --> 00:25:03.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started to read
the <i>Greatest Man </i> book instead.

00:25:05.437 --> 00:25:10.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A major key for me
to be able to make the necessary changes

00:25:10.108 --> 00:25:13.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was to cut off bad association.

00:25:13.211 --> 00:25:16.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was baptized in March 1994.

00:25:16.882 --> 00:25:19.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I finally took that step,

00:25:19.084 --> 00:25:22.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like I’d started on the right path.

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.056 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was so grateful that Jehovah

00:25:25.056 --> 00:25:27.459 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
had found me and that he’d drawn me.

00:25:28.426 --> 00:25:32.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really fell in love
with the thoughts of Psalm 8:1, 3, 4:

00:25:32.297 --> 00:25:34.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“O Jehovah . . . ,

00:25:34.332 --> 00:25:36.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when I see your heavens,

00:25:36.401 --> 00:25:38.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the works of your fingers,

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the moon and the stars
that you have prepared,

00:25:41.172 --> 00:25:43.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“what is mortal man
that you keep him in mind,

00:25:43.742 --> 00:25:46.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the son of earthling man
that you take care of him?”

00:25:46.912 --> 00:25:49.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt so insignificant,

00:25:49.581 --> 00:25:52.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet Jehovah knew me.

00:25:52.484 --> 00:25:57.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The hope of everlasting life
also really touched my heart,

00:25:57.122 --> 00:25:59.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so did Jehovah’s forgiveness.

00:25:59.758 --> 00:26:03.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt so grateful
that Jehovah could forgive me

00:26:03.094 --> 00:26:06.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all of my wrongdoing
and that I could have a fresh start.

00:26:06.965 --> 00:26:10.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we were invited to start circuit work,

00:26:10.235 --> 00:26:14.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had serious doubts about my inadequacies.

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:17.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was not fast at preparing talks.

00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:21.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For me, it always felt like trying to fit

00:26:21.479 --> 00:26:23.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a square peg into a round hole.

00:26:23.848 --> 00:26:25.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the very morning

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:29.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after receiving our assignment
to go in the circuit work full-time,

00:26:29.621 --> 00:26:33.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my Bible reading was Exodus chapters 3 and 4,

00:26:33.325 --> 00:26:37.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Moses cited his inadequacies to Jehovah

00:26:37.195 --> 00:26:39.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that he was not a fluent speaker.

00:26:39.898 --> 00:26:42.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, of course, Jehovah asked him,

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Who is it that assigns a mouth?’

00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:47.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was like Jehovah was saying to me:

00:26:47.339 --> 00:26:50.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Don’t worry. I will help you.’

00:26:50.542 --> 00:26:53.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To make the changes that I did in life,

00:26:53.979 --> 00:26:56.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m just so grateful to Jehovah.

00:26:56.781 --> 00:26:59.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before I learned the truth, I was lost.

00:26:59.517 --> 00:27:01.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know who I was.

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was just a mess.

00:27:03.855 --> 00:27:06.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to be a man,

00:27:06.057 --> 00:27:08.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I didn’t really ever know how to do it.

00:27:08.526 --> 00:27:12.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has rebuilt me from the ground up.

00:27:12.664 --> 00:27:15.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has given me everything.

00:27:24.542 --> 00:27:27.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can learn a lot from this experience.

00:27:27.979 --> 00:27:30.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some people, like Andrew,

00:27:30.348 --> 00:27:33.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have lives filled with challenging problems.

00:27:33.952 --> 00:27:37.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, by developing a relationship with God,

00:27:37.188 --> 00:27:39.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Andrew said,

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:43.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah has rebuilt me from the ground up.”

00:27:43.395 --> 00:27:45.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw that major changes

00:27:45.864 --> 00:27:48.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may be needed to make spiritual progress.

00:27:48.767 --> 00:27:53.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Andrew’s case, he cut off bad association.

00:27:53.638 --> 00:27:56.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, Andrew’s experience shows

00:27:56.908 --> 00:27:59.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that baptism isn’t the end of the journey.

00:27:59.878 --> 00:28:03.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He continued to grow spiritually.

00:28:03.448 --> 00:28:08.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if you’ve been raised
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses?

00:28:08.253 --> 00:28:11.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you thinking about getting baptized?

00:28:11.289 --> 00:28:15.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you made baptism your personal goal?

00:28:15.226 --> 00:28:17.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Getting baptized when you’re young

00:28:17.829 --> 00:28:22.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can lead to a life
filled with rich blessings.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With that in mind,

00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:27.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m so happy to welcome today

00:28:27.305 --> 00:28:28.807 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a very dear friend of mine,

00:28:28.807 --> 00:28:31.543 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Brother Robert P. Johnson.

00:28:31.543 --> 00:28:33.812 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
R. P., welcome to the program.

00:28:33.812 --> 00:28:34.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Mark.

00:28:34.946 --> 00:28:36.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I appreciate being here.

00:28:36.414 --> 00:28:39.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you’re here, R.P.,

00:28:39.117 --> 00:28:41.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you are a wonderful example

00:28:41.553 --> 00:28:43.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of someone who’s had a life

00:28:43.822 --> 00:28:46.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
filled with blessings in Jehovah’s service.

00:28:46.658 --> 00:28:47.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:50.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I know that your family
goes way back in the truth.

00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:51.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:28:51.229 --> 00:28:54.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, I understand
that your great grandfather

00:28:54.599 --> 00:28:56.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
learned the truth in Brother Russell’s time,

00:28:56.286 --> 00:28:57.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even before 1914.

00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:58.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right!

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:01.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that means
you’re a fourth-generation Witness.

00:29:01.539 --> 00:29:02.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mm-hm.

00:29:02.907 --> 00:29:06.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, like so many
who are watching our program,

00:29:06.277 --> 00:29:10.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you were a little boy growing up
in a congregation of Jehovah’s people.

00:29:10.749 --> 00:29:14.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how did you come
to the decision that you wanted

00:29:14.452 --> 00:29:17.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to dedicate your life to serve Jehovah
and then get baptized?

00:29:19.691 --> 00:29:22.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Mark, thinking back, I can identify

00:29:22.994 --> 00:29:27.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at least two
outstanding influences in my life.

00:29:27.465 --> 00:29:30.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the first was my parents.

00:29:30.935 --> 00:29:33.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having that heritage in the truth helped me.

00:29:33.905 --> 00:29:38.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was just an average kid in my early years.

00:29:38.343 --> 00:29:43.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the parents instilled in me a desire

00:29:43.314 --> 00:29:47.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to please Jehovah
and make it my life to do that.

00:29:47.619 --> 00:29:49.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They set goals before me.

00:29:49.621 --> 00:29:51.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They taught me the truth.

00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:54.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned enough from them to be able

00:29:54.192 --> 00:29:57.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make a dedication to Jehovah God

00:29:57.095 --> 00:29:59.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to have a close relationship with him.

00:29:59.297 --> 00:30:03.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so early on, that’s what I did.

00:30:03.735 --> 00:30:07.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember that evening after supper

00:30:07.138 --> 00:30:09.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in my bedroom 

00:30:09.607 --> 00:30:13.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
praying to Jehovah to accept my dedication.

00:30:13.878 --> 00:30:18.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The date was May 25, 1949.

00:30:18.383 --> 00:30:21.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was 11 years old at the time.

00:30:21.219 --> 00:30:25.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told my parents, and they were happy,

00:30:25.156 --> 00:30:28.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they just wanted me
to wait longer to make sure 

00:30:28.426 --> 00:30:31.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially how I
would handle the teenage years

00:30:31.896 --> 00:30:35.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so on, so I waited.

00:30:35.967 --> 00:30:39.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so then when did the moment
come for you to finally get baptized?

00:30:40.471 --> 00:30:44.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was at the 1953 international convention

00:30:44.475 --> 00:30:46.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Yankee Stadium in New York

00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:51.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on July 22, 1953, when I was baptized.

00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:55.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And again, I remember
that like it was yesterday.

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I came up out of the water,

00:30:57.488 --> 00:31:00.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thanked Jehovah that finally,

00:31:00.792 --> 00:31:04.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses!”

00:31:04.128 --> 00:31:07.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I also, like a child, added,

00:31:07.866 --> 00:31:09.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You can bring the end anytime now.”

00:31:11.803 --> 00:31:16.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you mentioned your parents,
the good influence they had on you,

00:31:16.374 --> 00:31:19.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but was there another influence
on you that helped you?

00:31:19.444 --> 00:31:20.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:31:20.912 --> 00:31:24.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the 1953 convention,
Brother Knorr had identified

00:31:24.983 --> 00:31:28.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there would be a special program

00:31:28.186 --> 00:31:31.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for training people in the truth.

00:31:31.356 --> 00:31:33.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And from the congregation,
there was a brother

00:31:33.825 --> 00:31:37.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the anointed named Charles Richardson,

00:31:37.262 --> 00:31:40.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my father asked Brother Richardson

00:31:40.231 --> 00:31:43.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to train me in this training program.

00:31:43.568 --> 00:31:45.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Brother Richardson

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:49.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a mentor to me
for the next five years of my life.

00:31:50.341 --> 00:31:52.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over the years, he helped me

00:31:52.243 --> 00:31:54.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
view the ministry as an opportunity

00:31:54.946 --> 00:31:59.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help people develop
a relationship with Jehovah 

00:31:59.851 --> 00:32:02.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, therefore, to reach out to them

00:32:02.954 --> 00:32:06.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in teaching them the truth
—the doctrinal truth—

00:32:06.491 --> 00:32:09.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but to help them to see
that Jehovah is a real person.

00:32:09.294 --> 00:32:14.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he helped me to enjoy the ministry.

00:32:14.299 --> 00:32:17.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is what has kept me happy

00:32:17.235 --> 00:32:19.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s service down to this day.

00:32:20.838 --> 00:32:24.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, just from your expressions
and what you talked about with me before,

00:32:24.842 --> 00:32:27.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could see that this Brother Richardson

00:32:27.545 --> 00:32:30.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had a tremendous impact on your life.

00:32:30.348 --> 00:32:33.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I think, R.P., it really made you

00:32:33.418 --> 00:32:36.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
want to be a trainer of other people

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because that’s how I first met you, right?

00:32:38.256 --> 00:32:39.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.
Right.

00:32:39.757 --> 00:32:41.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were the brother
assigned to be my trainer

00:32:41.759 --> 00:32:44.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I came to the Service Department.

00:32:44.262 --> 00:32:45.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember that fondly.

00:32:45.396 --> 00:32:48.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I know that I’m not the only one.

00:32:48.099 --> 00:32:50.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, you’ve really spent
your whole life training other people.

00:32:52.036 --> 00:32:54.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s been a privilege.

00:32:54.238 --> 00:32:58.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I was trained;
I was helped along the way.

00:32:58.109 --> 00:33:01.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was nobody special, but Jehovah

00:33:01.212 --> 00:33:03.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has extended undeserved kindness to me

00:33:03.815 --> 00:33:07.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and made all these things possible.

00:33:07.218 --> 00:33:11.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there’s no excuse
for me not passing along the baton.

00:33:11.356 --> 00:33:16.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s a delight
for me to see others carry it.

00:33:16.027 --> 00:33:18.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, let’s come back.

00:33:18.529 --> 00:33:19.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re 15 years old.

00:33:19.998 --> 00:33:22.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You get baptized at Yankee Stadium,

00:33:22.333 --> 00:33:26.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now as a result
of being baptized at this age,

00:33:26.537 --> 00:33:29.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how do you feel you benefited?

00:33:29.007 --> 00:33:31.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For one thing,

00:33:31.042 --> 00:33:36.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you know what you want to do
and you stay focused on it,

00:33:36.047 --> 00:33:39.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it makes it easier to deal
with whatever challenges come later.

00:33:39.951 --> 00:33:44.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so being dedicated

00:33:44.088 --> 00:33:47.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and baptized early in life

00:33:47.825 --> 00:33:52.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped me to stay focused on the truth.

00:33:52.363 --> 00:33:56.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still remember that dedication.

00:33:56.067 --> 00:33:58.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means something to me,

00:33:58.369 --> 00:34:03.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I tried to make it
mean something to others

00:34:03.074 --> 00:34:06.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(for as young as they can possibly make it).

00:34:06.044 --> 00:34:08.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they’ll find the same thing I found:

00:34:08.613 --> 00:34:10.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s blessing will be with them.

00:34:10.948 --> 00:34:13.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, at 15,

00:34:13.184 --> 00:34:14.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what doors start to open up?

00:34:14.952 --> 00:34:18.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What opportunities come to you
because you are a baptized brother?

00:34:18.423 --> 00:34:23.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At age 17, I was appointed
as a ministerial servant.

00:34:23.428 --> 00:34:28.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started pioneering right out
of high school at age 18.

00:34:28.433 --> 00:34:31.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And serving where the need was greater,

00:34:31.803 --> 00:34:35.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got a chance to work
at starting a new congregation.

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:38.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so at 21,

00:34:38.042 --> 00:34:40.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was congregation servant,
or an elder, at that point.

00:34:40.611 --> 00:34:44.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then there was a need:

00:34:44.048 --> 00:34:48.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The organization was looking for brothers
who could do traveling work.

00:34:48.119 --> 00:34:51.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So at age 25, I had the privilege

00:34:51.522 --> 00:34:53.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of being a traveling overseer.

00:34:53.791 --> 00:34:57.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, how did you feel
being an elder at 21?

00:34:57.562 --> 00:34:59.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being a circuit overseer at 25?

00:34:59.564 --> 00:35:02.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was it a little bit overwhelming
at such a young age?

00:35:02.467 --> 00:35:04.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was scared.

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:08.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew the truth,

00:35:08.072 --> 00:35:12.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I was uncertain about myself,

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:15.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then I also knew Jehovah would help me.

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:20.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned a lot as a young
traveling overseer, and I thank Jehovah

00:35:20.885 --> 00:35:25.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the people
in the circuits that I served 

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:28.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
endured those three years
that I was with them.

00:35:30.261 --> 00:35:33.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, those were the challenges,

00:35:33.097 --> 00:35:37.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what do you see as being the benefits
of being a young traveling overseer?

00:35:39.437 --> 00:35:41.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the congregation, they had somebody

00:35:41.506 --> 00:35:44.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who could stay out
in field service long hours.

00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:47.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also

00:35:47.812 --> 00:35:50.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the younger traveling overseer could relate

00:35:50.548 --> 00:35:53.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the young people

00:35:53.151 --> 00:35:57.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the younger adults in the congregation.

00:35:57.188 --> 00:36:02.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were other benefits
that even today different ones

00:36:02.093 --> 00:36:06.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I served in earlier circuits
bring forth to me.

00:36:06.297 --> 00:36:10.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, after having
a good time in field service

00:36:10.434 --> 00:36:15.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then the meetings,
I would do recreational things with the kids.

00:36:15.439 --> 00:36:18.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we ran track

00:36:18.442 --> 00:36:20.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
out in the streets,

00:36:20.745 --> 00:36:23.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we played board games,

00:36:23.347 --> 00:36:25.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
softball, basketball,

00:36:27.385 --> 00:36:31.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then we had good times
just talking about the truth

00:36:31.322 --> 00:36:33.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also talking

00:36:33.624 --> 00:36:37.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how you can put your ministry first,

00:36:37.195 --> 00:36:41.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there’s plenty of time
for seeking a mate later.

00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:45.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, for a time,
you were serving as a single brother,

00:36:45.369 --> 00:36:47.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but at some point, that changed.

00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:49.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When did that happen?

00:36:50.208 --> 00:36:52.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have enjoyed the best of two worlds.

00:36:52.977 --> 00:36:57.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I enjoyed singleness
and the blessings Jehovah gave me.

00:36:57.982 --> 00:37:02.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when I was 28 years old,

00:37:02.653 --> 00:37:06.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I married a beautiful pioneer sister,

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:10.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I had already gotten adjusted
in my circuit work.

00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:12.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was my second circuit.

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:14.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, thanks to Jehovah,

00:37:14.332 --> 00:37:17.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were able to be married, and to this day

00:37:17.602 --> 00:37:21.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gracie and I continue in full-time service

00:37:21.138 --> 00:37:23.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after 52 years of marriage.

00:37:24.041 --> 00:37:26.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So R.P.,

00:37:26.677 --> 00:37:30.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you started with circuit work,
and then later you went on to district work.

00:37:30.281 --> 00:37:31.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.

00:37:31.048 --> 00:37:33.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then you were teaching
the Kingdom Ministry School.

00:37:33.517 --> 00:37:34.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mm-hm.

00:37:34.452 --> 00:37:36.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then you got invited to Bethel.

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.

00:37:37.255 --> 00:37:39.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And 31 years at Bethel, right?

00:37:39.724 --> 00:37:40.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, yes.

00:37:40.958 --> 00:37:44.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now you and Gracie
are doing special pioneer work.

00:37:45.096 --> 00:37:47.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right, in Orlando, Florida.

00:37:47.231 --> 00:37:52.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you have more than 60 years
of full-time service to Jehovah.

00:37:53.704 --> 00:37:56.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s because of Jehovah’s blessing,

00:37:56.307 --> 00:37:58.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s made me happy.

00:37:58.909 --> 00:38:01.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the question I want to ask you is:

00:38:01.012 --> 00:38:05.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you’re looking back now
to these 60 wonderful years

00:38:05.316 --> 00:38:07.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—more than 60 wonderful years—

00:38:07.885 --> 00:38:12.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what would you say to young people
who are facing the same decision

00:38:12.623 --> 00:38:15.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you faced when you were
a little boy growing up in the truth?

00:38:16.927 --> 00:38:20.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the best thing
I could’ve done with my life,

00:38:20.231 --> 00:38:24.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I had many opportunities.

00:38:24.335 --> 00:38:28.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah blessed my humble efforts

00:38:28.406 --> 00:38:31.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he has blessed you and others too.

00:38:31.976 --> 00:38:34.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The young people today

00:38:34.245 --> 00:38:37.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have even more opportunities

00:38:37.481 --> 00:38:41.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jehovah’s organization
under the leadership of Jesus Christ

00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:45.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is expanding and moving fast.

00:38:45.122 --> 00:38:48.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, like Brother Richardson taught me,

00:38:48.526 --> 00:38:50.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you just make yourself available,

00:38:50.895 --> 00:38:53.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then the organization

00:38:53.931 --> 00:38:57.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will find a place for you and use you,

00:38:57.201 --> 00:39:00.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s so true today.

00:39:00.705 --> 00:39:04.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of my greatest joys
is to see the young people

00:39:04.175 --> 00:39:07.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take the baton and run with it,

00:39:07.078 --> 00:39:10.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I have no regrets.

00:39:10.881 --> 00:39:12.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s been no challenge

00:39:12.917 --> 00:39:17.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that has overwhelmed me
and made me regret things.

00:39:17.355 --> 00:39:19.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were challenges, of course,

00:39:19.457 --> 00:39:23.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but with Jehovah’s help,
well, I’m here today.

00:39:23.094 --> 00:39:26.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that can be true of our young people.

00:39:28.232 --> 00:39:32.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So seize the opportunity while you’re young

00:39:32.103 --> 00:39:34.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and experience the blessing

00:39:34.739 --> 00:39:39.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah gives those
who serve him from youth onward.

00:39:41.479 --> 00:39:43.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
R.P., it has been such a wonderful joy

00:39:43.514 --> 00:39:45.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have you here on this program

00:39:45.549 --> 00:39:49.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to hear about your life filled with joy,

00:39:49.353 --> 00:39:51.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your life filled with blessings,

00:39:51.522 --> 00:39:55.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all because of the decision
you made just as a little boy

00:39:55.326 --> 00:39:58.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to dedicate your life
to Jehovah and get baptized.

00:39:58.763 --> 00:40:00.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you so much.

00:40:00.364 --> 00:40:02.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.
I appreciate talking about it.

00:40:04.835 --> 00:40:08.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Baptism is always a special feature

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:10.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our conventions and assemblies.

00:40:10.474 --> 00:40:14.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see that in the following report
on the special convention

00:40:14.211 --> 00:40:17.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
held in Mozambique in 2018.

00:40:34.365 --> 00:40:36.834 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The Mozambique special convention

00:40:36.834 --> 00:40:38.836 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is truly outstanding

00:40:38.836 --> 00:40:40.337 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for so many different reasons.

00:40:40.337 --> 00:40:43.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One thing
that has made this convention unique

00:40:43.107 --> 00:40:45.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that we have so many courageous brothers

00:40:45.709 --> 00:40:48.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have been in prison for their faith

00:40:48.212 --> 00:40:51.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Angola, Korea, Malawi, Zimbabwe,

00:40:51.315 --> 00:40:53.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and from some of the countries in Europe

00:40:53.651 --> 00:40:57.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who had to really stand up
and set an example.

00:40:57.054 --> 00:40:58.489 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And to have them all here

00:40:58.489 --> 00:40:59.557 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with our courageous

00:40:59.557 --> 00:41:00.724 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Mozambican brothers

00:41:00.724 --> 00:41:01.959 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
has made this

00:41:01.959 --> 00:41:03.093 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
convention so special.

00:41:04.695 --> 00:41:06.163 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It is very encouraging

00:41:06.163 --> 00:41:07.898 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to be at this special convention.

00:41:07.898 --> 00:41:09.500 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We have spent ten years

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:10.668 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in the “reeducation camps”

00:41:10.668 --> 00:41:14.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with our brothers from Malawi,
and we were at the same camp.

00:41:14.305 --> 00:41:17.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And today we are together
at this special convention.

00:41:17.308 --> 00:41:19.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s very encouraging.

00:41:20.144 --> 00:41:22.279 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In 1990, I was judged and condemned

00:41:22.279 --> 00:41:24.081 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to 15 months of prison in Paris.

00:41:24.882 --> 00:41:26.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were about 100 brothers in prison.

00:41:26.917 --> 00:41:29.153 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They tried to shame us,

00:41:29.153 --> 00:41:31.655 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but thanks to Jehovah, we had courage.

00:41:31.655 --> 00:41:34.024 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And today this beautiful convention

00:41:34.024 --> 00:41:36.694 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
fills us with even more courage.

00:41:37.628 --> 00:41:39.129 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was one of the brothers serving

00:41:39.129 --> 00:41:41.699 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
as a bicycle courier during the ban,

00:41:41.699 --> 00:41:43.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
delivering literature long distances.

00:41:43.801 --> 00:41:47.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was difficult work
because the police were searching for us.

00:41:47.238 --> 00:41:51.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah blessed us with courage,
giving us a heart without fear.

00:41:53.978 --> 00:41:56.013 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Because of our Christian neutrality,

00:41:56.013 --> 00:41:57.648 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we were in prison.

00:41:57.648 --> 00:41:59.149 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Although it was a difficult time,

00:41:59.149 --> 00:42:01.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gave us courage to endure,

00:42:01.952 --> 00:42:03.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now we are here together.

00:42:03.954 --> 00:42:06.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really thank Jehovah for that.

00:42:10.528 --> 00:42:12.229 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was arrested and sentenced

00:42:12.229 --> 00:42:14.331 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to six years in prison.

00:42:14.331 --> 00:42:16.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite all these difficulties,

00:42:16.333 --> 00:42:18.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
today I feel very happy.

00:42:18.335 --> 00:42:20.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel very encouraged.

00:42:26.143 --> 00:42:28.612 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
At this convention, we released

00:42:28.612 --> 00:42:31.048 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the <i>Greek Scriptures</i>  in Tshwa and Sena.

00:42:37.421 --> 00:42:39.590 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much, Jehovah,

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:41.859 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for this wonderful provision.

00:42:41.859 --> 00:42:43.928 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I will surely use it

00:42:43.928 --> 00:42:46.564 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
while speaking about Jehovah’s name

00:42:46.583 --> 00:42:48.098 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in Tshwa.

00:42:48.098 --> 00:42:49.934 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We are so happy to have

00:42:49.934 --> 00:42:52.836 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
this Bible in the Tshwa language.

00:42:52.836 --> 00:42:56.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s easy to read,
and it will improve our family worship.

00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:59.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those were the first two local languages

00:42:59.443 --> 00:43:02.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Mozambique to receive
any part of the <i>New World Translation.</i>

00:43:02.746 --> 00:43:05.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it was a very exciting day!

00:43:09.553 --> 00:43:10.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This convention was tied

00:43:10.921 --> 00:43:14.224 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in to 18 locations in Mozambique.

00:43:14.224 --> 00:43:17.861 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
A total of 1,685 were baptized.

00:43:22.333 --> 00:43:24.602 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I have faith in Jehovah

00:43:24.602 --> 00:43:25.769 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and want to have

00:43:25.769 --> 00:43:28.472 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a close relationship with him.

00:43:28.472 --> 00:43:32.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many have commented
on the fact that among the 981

00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:35.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were baptized in Maputo,
there were many young ones.

00:43:35.779 --> 00:43:38.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it just shows
that the families here in Mozambique

00:43:38.816 --> 00:43:41.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are working very hard with their young ones 

00:43:41.118 --> 00:43:44.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help them to know Jehovah and love Jehovah

00:43:44.455 --> 00:43:46.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to know what it means to be courageous.

00:43:49.727 --> 00:43:50.794 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
To organize

00:43:50.794 --> 00:43:51.829 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a special convention

00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:52.863 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in Africa 

00:43:52.863 --> 00:43:55.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
requires a lot of work and a lot of planning.

00:43:57.067 --> 00:43:59.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you can truly see
the blessing of Jehovah here

00:43:59.937 --> 00:44:03.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because everything has gone so beautifully

00:44:03.273 --> 00:44:06.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the delegates are so happy!

00:44:06.477 --> 00:44:10.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can really feel
that Jehovah’s spirit is with us.

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:19.156 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Before the work was banned in Mozambique,

00:44:19.156 --> 00:44:20.891 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we used to sing to Jehovah.

00:44:21.859 --> 00:44:24.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the camps, we continued to sing joyfully.

00:44:25.763 --> 00:44:27.998 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now with the special convention,

00:44:27.998 --> 00:44:30.434 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we continue to sing to our delegates.

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:36.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of the delegates
commented that their favorite part

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:40.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the convention was going out
in the ministry with the local brothers.

00:44:40.177 --> 00:44:44.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though the brothers
may have very limited resources,

00:44:44.181 --> 00:44:47.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they showed them tremendous hospitality;

00:44:47.117 --> 00:44:49.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it made a huge impression.

00:44:49.486 --> 00:44:52.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of the delegates even said
that when they go back,

00:44:52.189 --> 00:44:55.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is going to have
a life-changing effect on them.

00:45:01.265 --> 00:45:02.833 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We want to assure

00:45:02.833 --> 00:45:04.501 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
these dear brothers and sisters

00:45:04.501 --> 00:45:07.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Governing Body loves them.

00:45:07.071 --> 00:45:09.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But greater than that,
Jehovah God knows about them;

00:45:09.973 --> 00:45:12.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he loves them; he’s supporting them.

00:45:55.185 --> 00:45:57.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a joyous occasion!

00:45:57.387 --> 00:46:00.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll never forget it and,
I trust, neither will 

00:46:00.791 --> 00:46:05.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the 1,685 brothers and sisters

00:46:05.496 --> 00:46:08.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were baptized at that convention.

00:46:08.565 --> 00:46:12.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s nothing like the day you’re baptized.

00:46:12.169 --> 00:46:14.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our new music video

00:46:14.171 --> 00:46:17.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
captures this in word and song.

00:46:37.261 --> 00:46:53.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the quiet of the night,
With a million stars above,

00:46:53.510 --> 00:47:10.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I think of you and of all you do,
It fills my heart with love.

00:47:13.564 --> 00:47:30.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I give my life to you,
You will always be my guide.

00:47:30.981 --> 00:47:47.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the days go by, you will see that I
Am forever on your side.

00:47:50.901 --> 00:47:59.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because you gave me hope
That changed my life

00:47:59.109 --> 00:48:05.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And strength
to help me through,

00:48:05.883 --> 00:48:14.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because you gave your Son
To die for me,

00:48:14.725 --> 00:48:29.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I give my life to you;
I give my life to you.

00:48:32.943 --> 00:48:48.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the sun lights up the sky,
Melting warm upon my skin,

00:48:48.492 --> 00:49:03.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How your endless days and your tender ways
Stir these feelings deep within!

00:49:06.663 --> 00:49:16.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because you gave me hope
That changed my life

00:49:16.053 --> 00:49:22.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And strength
to help me through,

00:49:22.392 --> 00:49:30.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because you gave your Son
To die for me,

00:49:30.233 --> 00:49:45.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I give my life to you;
I give my life to you.

00:49:47.384 --> 00:49:56.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because you gave me hope
That changed my life

00:49:56.526 --> 00:50:02.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And strength
to help me through,

00:50:02.666 --> 00:50:11.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because you gave your Son
To die for me,

00:50:11.141 --> 00:50:29.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I give my life to you;
I give my life to you.

00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:41.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful original song

00:50:41.772 --> 00:50:44.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the thoughts and feelings we each have

00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:48.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we dedicate our life to Jehovah!

00:50:48.078 --> 00:50:52.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our program has focused on baptism.

00:50:52.249 --> 00:50:55.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learned
that our primary goal in the ministry

00:50:55.852 --> 00:51:00.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to help people
establish their own relationship

00:51:00.123 --> 00:51:02.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah that moves them

00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:07.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to dedicate their life to him
and be baptized.

00:51:07.197 --> 00:51:10.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw that with Jehovah’s help,

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:14.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
obstacles in the way
of baptism can be removed.

00:51:14.004 --> 00:51:16.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Andrew’s experience showed us

00:51:16.072 --> 00:51:18.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that baptism can be

00:51:18.075 --> 00:51:20.677 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a turning point in one’s life.

00:51:20.677 --> 00:51:22.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw that making the decision

00:51:22.679 --> 00:51:26.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to dedicate your life to Jehovah
when you’re young

00:51:26.583 --> 00:51:30.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can lead to a lifetime of joy

00:51:30.387 --> 00:51:34.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and rich blessings from Jehovah.

00:51:34.257 --> 00:51:38.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We heard from many
who successfully made the journey to baptism

00:51:38.462 --> 00:51:43.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and saw the joy and happiness
of that special day.

00:51:44.501 --> 00:51:46.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before we close,

00:51:46.503 --> 00:51:50.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s visit our brothers
and sisters in Angola.

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:55.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Republic of Angola
is on the west coast of Africa.

00:51:55.112 --> 00:51:59.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a beautiful
and geographically diverse land.

00:51:59.249 --> 00:52:04.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s home
to the breathtaking Kalandula Falls.

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:07.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The ministry here
ranges from the city of Luanda,

00:52:07.991 --> 00:52:11.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the territory is worked every few days,

00:52:11.394 --> 00:52:15.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rugged and remote areas accessible

00:52:15.065 --> 00:52:17.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only by walking.

00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:19.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Angola’s population

00:52:19.669 --> 00:52:23.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of some 30 million people

00:52:23.807 --> 00:52:27.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
includes many indigenous tribes
and language groups.

00:52:29.379 --> 00:52:32.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About 45 percent of the population
