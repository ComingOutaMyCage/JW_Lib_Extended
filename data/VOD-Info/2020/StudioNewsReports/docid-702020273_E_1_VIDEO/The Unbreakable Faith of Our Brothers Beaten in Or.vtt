They drove up in front of our car

00:00:05.317 --> 00:00:07.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a Jeep with tinted windows
and blocked the road.

00:00:07.945 --> 00:00:10.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Several masked men with automatic weapons

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:13.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
jumped out and shouted, “Don’t move!”

00:00:13.617 --> 00:00:15.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They twisted my arms behind my back

00:00:15.995 --> 00:00:18.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pushed me up against the hood of my car.

This interview was filmed in July 2019.

00:00:22.543 --> 00:00:25.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Feliks Makhammadiyev described his arrest

00:00:25.254 --> 00:00:27.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his life in the detention center,

00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:29.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he spent almost a year.

00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:31.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time, no one imagined

00:00:31.427 --> 00:00:33.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that just two months later
a court would find him guilty

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:38.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of organizing extremist activity
and imprison him

00:00:38.017 --> 00:00:40.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with five fellow believers.

00:00:46.942 --> 00:00:50.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In December 2019,
the Saratov Regional Court

00:00:50.654 --> 00:00:55.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dismissed the appeal filed by the Witnesses
and upheld the verdict.

00:00:55.576 --> 00:01:00.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Early in February, five of the six
convicted Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were sent to Penal Colony No. 1 in Orenburg.

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:06.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Upon their arrival on February 6,

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were beaten by prison guards.

00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:12.676 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The guards forced them to their knees

00:01:12.676 --> 00:01:14.261 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and started beating them

00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:17.097 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with clubs and fists and kicking them.

00:01:17.097 --> 00:01:19.099 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Feliks was beaten the most,

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:20.851 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
probably because he was smiling

00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:22.019 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when they went in

00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:24.605 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—because he’s always smiling.

00:01:24.605 --> 00:01:27.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Feliks Makhammadiyev was diagnosed
with a broken rib

00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:30.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a damaged lung and kidney.

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aleksey and Tatyana Budenchuk
have two young children.

00:01:40.788 --> 00:01:43.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The family lives in a small house,

00:01:43.332 --> 00:01:47.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their main source of income
comes from their small farm.

00:01:47.753 --> 00:01:50.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But on June 12, 2018,

00:01:50.089 --> 00:01:54.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the lives of the entire family
suddenly changed when a group

00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:57.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of armed officers raided their home.

00:01:57.972 --> 00:02:00.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw that someone wearing a mask and uniform

00:02:00.015 --> 00:02:01.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
went into the garage.

00:02:01.934 --> 00:02:05.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A few seconds later, he came up the stairs,

00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:08.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
forced me to the floor, and handcuffed me.

00:02:08.148 --> 00:02:12.444 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Afterward, they took Mom and Dad away.

00:02:12.444 --> 00:02:15.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was afraid that I might
never see them again.

00:02:15.656 --> 00:02:19.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually Tatyana was released,

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but two days later, a court sentenced
Aleksey to a detention center.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Konstantin Bazhenov and Feliks Makhammadiyev

00:02:25.332 --> 00:02:28.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were sent to the same detention center.

00:02:28.335 --> 00:02:31.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Three other Witnesses were forced
to sign a document

00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:34.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
agreeing not to leave
their city of residence.

00:02:34.842 --> 00:02:39.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I spent a total of 11 months and 8 days
in the detention center.

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:43.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, on May 20, 2019,
we were released from there

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:46.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and were placed
under a different form

00:02:46.186 --> 00:02:49.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of restriction
—a ban on certain activities.

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:53.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In July 2019, the criminal trial

00:02:53.235 --> 00:02:57.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against the six Witnesses
from the city of Saratov began.

00:02:58.532 --> 00:03:00.743 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The charges read in black and white:

00:03:00.743 --> 00:03:02.202 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“There are no victims,

00:03:02.202 --> 00:03:05.497 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
no harm whatsoever has been done to anyone.”

00:03:05.497 --> 00:03:09.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An individual should be informed
of the accusation against him,

00:03:09.334 --> 00:03:13.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including specific details
about the time and location.

00:03:13.088 --> 00:03:15.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this document reads like this:

00:03:15.632 --> 00:03:17.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At an undetermined time

00:03:17.718 --> 00:03:21.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in an undetermined place
after a certain date,

00:03:21.388 --> 00:03:23.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“somebody came up with the idea

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to create an organization
whose activity was banned.”

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:32.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually all six Witnesses
were found guilty

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:36.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sentenced to imprisonment
from two to three and a half years.

00:03:36.737 --> 00:03:39.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The court decision proved to be a real test

00:03:39.698 --> 00:03:42.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for their friends and relatives.

00:03:42.951 --> 00:03:46.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The wives of the six convicted Witnesses
from Saratov

00:03:46.163 --> 00:03:49.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
vow to continue to support
their husbands

00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:53.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to never renounce their faith in God.

00:03:53.045 --> 00:03:56.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In July 2019, in an interview
given to our film crew,

00:03:56.548 --> 00:04:00.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Feliks Makhammadiyev
and Aleksey Budenchuk assured us

00:04:00.803 --> 00:04:03.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they are not embittered
by the criminal prosecution

00:04:03.013 --> 00:04:06.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that they view any hardships
they may have to face

00:04:06.642 --> 00:04:10.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as an opportunity to prove
their loyalty to Jehovah.

00:04:10.062 --> 00:04:14.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were times when it seemed
I couldn’t take it anymore,

00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:18.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but every day I prayed to Jehovah
that he give me

00:04:18.153 --> 00:04:22.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
peace and joy for that day.

00:04:22.324 --> 00:04:25.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am so proud of him!

00:04:25.536 --> 00:04:28.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only did he face
the court trial with dignity,

00:04:28.247 --> 00:04:31.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he continues to bear up with dignity,

00:04:31.083 --> 00:04:34.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he even helps me to endure.
