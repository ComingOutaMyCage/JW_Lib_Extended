Since our last update,

00:00:03.987 --> 00:00:06.589 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the coronavirus pandemic has taken

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:09.025 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a grim toll around the world.

00:00:09.025 --> 00:00:10.694 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And we know

00:00:10.694 --> 00:00:13.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that more and more of you 
dear brothers and sisters

00:00:13.663 --> 00:00:17.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are grappling with the effects
of this crisis every day.

00:00:17.867 --> 00:00:20.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to assure you of our love

00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:24.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and of how deeply concerned
we are about each one of you

00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:28.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and of the many prayers
being offered in your behalf.

00:00:28.712 --> 00:00:32.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we trust that Jehovah will give you

00:00:32.315 --> 00:00:34.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the power beyond what is normal,”

00:00:34.918 --> 00:00:38.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as promised at 2 Corinthians 4:7,

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:40.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you can endure this pandemic

00:00:40.824 --> 00:00:45.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with your faith
in Jehovah’s unfailing promises intact.

00:00:47.197 --> 00:00:50.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite all the challenges we’ve been facing,

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:53.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hasn’t it been encouraging to see how quickly

00:00:53.436 --> 00:00:56.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and effectively Jehovah’s people have adapted

00:00:56.673 --> 00:00:59.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the change in circumstances

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—from holding meetings by videoconference

00:01:02.178 --> 00:01:06.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to preaching and teaching
by e-mail, letter writing,

00:01:06.182 --> 00:01:09.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
telephone, and text message?

00:01:09.252 --> 00:01:14.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this was especially true
regarding the Memorial.

00:01:14.257 --> 00:01:18.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this report,
we’d like to share a few updates

00:01:18.194 --> 00:01:21.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how our brothers
and sisters around the world

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:24.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were strengthened 
as they came together

00:01:24.134 --> 00:01:27.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the special talk
and the Memorial.

00:01:28.238 --> 00:01:31.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the day of the Memorial drew closer,

00:01:31.274 --> 00:01:34.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did you wonder
how this was all going to work?

00:01:34.444 --> 00:01:37.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would we be meeting in smaller groups?

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:40.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would we handle the emblems?

00:01:40.016 --> 00:01:43.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could we invite coworkers,
neighbors, and interested ones?

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where would we invite them to
if we couldn’t meet at the Kingdom Hall?

00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:53.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We longed to be together
on this important occasion,

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:57.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we also recognized
how important it was to comply fully

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with any government restrictions
and physical-distancing guidelines

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not only to show
our “subjection to the superior authorities”

00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:11.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also for our own safety
and that of our neighbors.

00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:14.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we observed the Memorial,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though that meant
doing so in unique ways

00:02:17.854 --> 00:02:21.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—ways we might never
have experienced before.

00:02:21.257 --> 00:02:25.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the first time in theocratic history,

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:30.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
millions observed the Memorial
by videoconference.

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:33.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This resulted in some unique opportunities

00:02:33.303 --> 00:02:35.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to share the Memorial with others.

00:02:35.738 --> 00:02:39.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you may have seen
on the jw.org® Newsroom,

00:02:39.943 --> 00:02:44.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Philippines,
one young pioneer’s invitation

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to view the Memorial by videoconference

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
resulted in over 31,000 non-Witnesses

00:02:50.753 --> 00:02:53.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tying in by video or audio!

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For each of us, being in our own home
 for the Memorial

00:02:58.895 --> 00:03:01.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was an unforgettable experience.

00:03:01.965 --> 00:03:05.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, we were fully united
with our brothers worldwide

00:03:05.902 --> 00:03:09.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in demonstrating our love
for Jehovah and Jesus

00:03:09.472 --> 00:03:11.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on this special day.

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:16.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this video report from Tab Honsberger,

00:03:16.045 --> 00:03:19.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who serves as a member
of the Haiti Branch Committee,

00:03:19.215 --> 00:03:23.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice the benefits that came
from observing the Memorial

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:27.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by videoconference
and even by telephone in Haiti.

00:03:27.724 --> 00:03:31.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt you will identify
with the feelings experienced

00:03:31.394 --> 00:03:33.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the brothers in Haiti.

00:03:35.698 --> 00:03:37.467 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We can truly say

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:39.602 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that the commemoration of Christ’s death

00:03:39.602 --> 00:03:42.939 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in Haiti this year was a memorable Memorial.

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:47.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One congregation of 24 publishers
in the far northwest of our country

00:03:47.944 --> 00:03:52.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was so pleased and thrilled
to have 85 in attendance

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:54.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the Memorial in their congregation.

00:03:56.052 --> 00:03:59.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A brother relates how he studied
the Bible with a man in the past,

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:04.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but because he didn’t progress, it was
decided at that time to stop the study.

00:04:04.294 --> 00:04:06.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was two years ago.

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this year, for this year’s Memorial,
in fact, the day before the Memorial,

00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:13.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the man (the former student)
calls the brother

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:15.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and says,
“I would like to attend the Memorial.”

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:17.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, our brother said:
“That’ll be wonderful.

00:04:17.707 --> 00:04:21.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can attend the Memorial
with our congregation via Zoom.”

00:04:21.611 --> 00:04:23.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s what the man did.

00:04:23.646 --> 00:04:27.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the Memorial observance,
he was quite touched by it.

00:04:27.617 --> 00:04:31.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said, “You know, when I look
around the world right now

00:04:31.487 --> 00:04:35.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I see everything that’s happening,
it’s very clear to me

00:04:35.024 --> 00:04:38.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that it will be very soon
when God’s Kingdom will intervene

00:04:38.728 --> 00:04:41.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put a stop to all the problems
that we now know.”

00:04:41.798 --> 00:04:46.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, he said, “If anybody
wants to serve God,

00:04:46.803 --> 00:04:50.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is now the time to start doing so.”

00:04:50.239 --> 00:04:53.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the man took his own counsel to heart,

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:57.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re happy to say that he’s attending
meetings with us once again.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So whether it was
through videoconferencing

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:05.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or telephone conference calls,
we can say that the faith of our brothers

00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:09.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was truly strengthened
through the Memorial this year.

00:05:09.392 --> 00:05:13.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, one sister, a pioneer sister
in the south of the country,

00:05:13.062 --> 00:05:15.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
explained why it was special for her.

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:18.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said, “It’s like we took
the commemoration of Christ’s death

00:05:18.868 --> 00:05:22.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we brought it into the homes
of all the brothers and sisters.”

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:26.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course,
Jehovah blessed that arrangement.

00:05:28.111 --> 00:05:31.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t we feel united
with our brothers in Haiti,

00:05:31.114 --> 00:05:34.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
having observed
the Memorial in similar ways?

00:05:34.817 --> 00:05:37.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here at world headquarters,

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we realized that not all
those invited to the Memorial

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:44.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could log on to a videoconference.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So adjustments were made
to the jw.org website

00:05:48.798 --> 00:05:52.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make the special talk
and the Memorial talk available

00:05:52.735 --> 00:05:54.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the public to stream

00:05:54.737 --> 00:05:58.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or download in over 500 languages.

00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:02.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to this provision, millions more

00:06:02.011 --> 00:06:06.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had the opportunity
to benefit from these programs.

00:06:06.049 --> 00:06:10.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to share one beautiful example
of a brother named Martin,

00:06:10.653 --> 00:06:14.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who lives in a very remote town in Kenya.

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:17.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He downloaded the Memorial talk

00:06:17.126 --> 00:06:20.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that he could share it
with others in his service group.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Martin is disabled

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:25.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also suffers
from a serious health condition

00:06:25.968 --> 00:06:29.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that causes his body to overheat,

00:06:29.105 --> 00:06:32.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that didn’t stop him from hiring a driver

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:36.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a motorcycle
and traveling in hot weather

00:06:36.245 --> 00:06:38.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to provide a recording of the Memorial talk

00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:42.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those who otherwise
wouldn’t have had access to it.

00:06:42.885 --> 00:06:46.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of Martin’s self-sacrificing effort,

00:06:46.622 --> 00:06:49.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
13 people in this remote area,

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:54.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including some Bible students,
attended the Memorial.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a blessing all of these
special arrangements proved to be!

00:06:58.901 --> 00:07:02.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In many cases, they resulted
in non-Witness family members

00:07:02.905 --> 00:07:07.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“attending” their first Memorial
right from their own homes.

00:07:09.145 --> 00:07:13.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, of course, the technology
that made this possible

00:07:13.182 --> 00:07:16.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not readily available everywhere.

00:07:16.252 --> 00:07:19.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In many parts of Africa, for example,

00:07:19.122 --> 00:07:22.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Internet access is extremely limited.

00:07:22.892 --> 00:07:26.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This made video and telephone conferencing

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:28.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or streaming talks over the Internet

00:07:28.631 --> 00:07:31.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
virtually impossible.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since this all unfolded very quickly,

00:07:34.904 --> 00:07:37.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about one week before the Memorial,

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
several African countries faced the fact

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that many of their publishers

00:07:43.212 --> 00:07:47.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would not be able to use
any of these options.

00:07:47.183 --> 00:07:52.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result, the Governing Body
approved for branches in Africa

00:07:52.188 --> 00:07:55.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make the special talk
and Memorial available

00:07:55.691 --> 00:07:58.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on TV and radio.

00:07:58.494 --> 00:08:01.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As reported on jw.org,

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:06.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these arrangements benefited
over 400,000 publishers

00:08:06.335 --> 00:08:10.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in addition to an untold number
of interested persons.

00:08:10.706 --> 00:08:15.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers worked tirelessly
just days before these events

00:08:15.144 --> 00:08:20.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to negotiate the needed arrangements
with radio and TV stations.

00:08:20.116 --> 00:08:22.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In one location in Mozambique,

00:08:22.718 --> 00:08:25.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the agreement
with the TV station was finalized

00:08:25.888 --> 00:08:29.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only <i>three hours</i>
before the Memorial talk

00:08:29.825 --> 00:08:31.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was to be broadcast!

00:08:31.827 --> 00:08:33.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some congregations,

00:08:33.996 --> 00:08:37.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after struggling
with unsuccessful downloads,

00:08:37.166 --> 00:08:42.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unreliable phone lines,
and failing Internet connections,

00:08:42.171 --> 00:08:45.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the situation started to feel hopeless.

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:49.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then brothers
unexpectedly started receiving

00:08:49.579 --> 00:08:54.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
e-mails and text messages
notifying them that the Memorial talk

00:08:54.417 --> 00:08:56.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be available on TV.

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:59.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some cases, they found out

00:08:59.522 --> 00:09:03.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just minutes before the program began.

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:06.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s how some
who received the program this way

00:09:06.896 --> 00:09:11.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
expressed their gratitude:
One brother said:

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The Creator has surpassed our needs

00:09:14.337 --> 00:09:17.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in a way that we could not imagine.

00:09:17.006 --> 00:09:21.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The pandemic
cannot stop Jehovah’s will.

00:09:21.377 --> 00:09:24.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This makes us more and more convinced

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:27.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he indeed is a strong tower.”

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:31.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another wrote: “We are very grateful

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for the arrangement that was made
to broadcast the Memorial.

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:38.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It felt like we were
at the Kingdom Hall and not alone.

00:09:38.527 --> 00:09:43.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We are deeply grateful
that in this time of COVID-19,

00:09:43.266 --> 00:09:46.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nothing has prevented us
from holding the Memorial

00:09:46.802 --> 00:09:49.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the death of Jesus Christ.”

00:09:50.573 --> 00:09:53.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Branch Committee in Congo (Kinshasa)

00:09:53.643 --> 00:09:58.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made similar arrangements for both
the Memorial and the special talk

00:09:58.281 --> 00:10:03.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be broadcast on television
and radio stations throughout the country.

00:10:03.286 --> 00:10:07.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following interview
with Hugues Kabitshwa,

00:10:07.657 --> 00:10:11.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note the encouraging experiences
that resulted.

00:10:13.462 --> 00:10:15.731 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
With the lack of Internet in most parts

00:10:15.732 --> 00:10:17.267 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of our branch territory

00:10:17.267 --> 00:10:18.801 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the growing restrictions

00:10:18.802 --> 00:10:20.369 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because of the pandemic,

00:10:20.369 --> 00:10:22.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were delighted
to receive approval

00:10:22.538 --> 00:10:25.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have the special talk
broadcast over radio.

00:10:25.508 --> 00:10:29.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we were asking,
Will it really work?

00:10:29.545 --> 00:10:31.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A circuit overseer reported

00:10:31.781 --> 00:10:34.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in the city of Gemena, the brothers
tried to arrange

00:10:34.617 --> 00:10:37.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a local radio station
to broadcast the special talk.

00:10:37.787 --> 00:10:41.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when they went to pay,
they learned from the director

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:45.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the original time they had arranged 
for was no longer available.

00:10:45.561 --> 00:10:47.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The only available time

00:10:47.596 --> 00:10:51.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was an hour and a half earlier,
at 8:30 a.m.

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:55.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Relying on Jehovah,
they agreed to the new time,

00:10:55.304 --> 00:11:00.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they had only a few hours
to inform everyone about the change.

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:03.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite the earlier time,
many people tuned in.

00:11:03.846 --> 00:11:07.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And right after the talk,
a heavy rain began

00:11:07.183 --> 00:11:11.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
disrupting all radio broadcasts
until later that night.

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:14.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s hand was with the brothers.

00:11:14.123 --> 00:11:18.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ve received encouraging reports
from all over the territory.

00:11:18.661 --> 00:11:21.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, another circuit overseer

00:11:21.464 --> 00:11:26.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reported that in his circuit,
public response to the talk was so positive

00:11:26.235 --> 00:11:30.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that people called the radio station
asking to hear the talk again.

00:11:30.539 --> 00:11:35.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the brothers arranged to broadcast
the talk a second time on the same day.

00:11:35.411 --> 00:11:37.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So far this

00:11:37.012 --> 00:11:41.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has resulted in 25 new
telephone Bible studies in that circuit.

00:11:41.684 --> 00:11:45.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, despite this pandemic,
the radio worked

00:11:45.988 --> 00:11:50.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jehovah made sure that this talk
remains for us even more special.

00:11:52.995 --> 00:11:56.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do these experiences show us?

00:11:56.031 --> 00:11:59.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even a global pandemic could not stop us

00:11:59.668 --> 00:12:02.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from being united in true worship.

00:12:02.738 --> 00:12:06.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Jesus said at John 14:15:

00:12:06.208 --> 00:12:09.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you love me,

00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:12.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will observe my commandments.”

00:12:12.715 --> 00:12:16.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Above all else,
it was our deep love for Jehovah

00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:21.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for Jesus that moved us
to give thanks for what they did

00:12:21.056 --> 00:12:25.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in providing the ransom
and to obey Jesus’ command

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:28.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “keep doing this
in remembrance of me.”

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We showed that love
by observing the Memorial

00:12:32.568 --> 00:12:36.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enjoying the special talk
as one united people,

00:12:36.472 --> 00:12:40.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though it meant
doing so in unique ways.

00:12:40.743 --> 00:12:44.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are certain
that Jehovah and his Son

00:12:44.613 --> 00:12:49.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are very happy and very proud
of what we were able to do

00:12:49.151 --> 00:12:52.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
worldwide under the present circumstances.

00:12:52.955 --> 00:12:56.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Surely, the words
of Hebrews 6:10 apply,

00:12:56.592 --> 00:13:01.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we’re reminded
that Jehovah will never ‘forget our work

00:13:01.497 --> 00:13:04.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the love we have shown for his name.’

00:13:04.934 --> 00:13:08.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although we don’t know
when the present world situation

00:13:08.604 --> 00:13:13.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with this pandemic will end,
we do know this:

00:13:13.175 --> 00:13:16.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s purpose will not fail.

00:13:16.412 --> 00:13:20.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a beginning to the pandemic
and there will be an end.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah and his Son will make certain

00:13:23.853 --> 00:13:28.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that all causes for harm
will soon be completely removed

00:13:28.324 --> 00:13:32.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
once this system of things
is gone forever,

00:13:32.127 --> 00:13:35.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and aren’t we grateful for that?

00:13:35.631 --> 00:13:38.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please be assured of our warm love

00:13:38.868 --> 00:13:41.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prayers in your behalf.

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:45.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
