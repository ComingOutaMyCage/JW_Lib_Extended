Just a few months ago,

00:00:04.287 --> 00:00:06.956 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
most of us had probably

00:00:06.956 --> 00:00:11.628 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
never even heard the word <i>“</i>coronavirus.”

00:00:11.628 --> 00:00:16.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now the words “coronavirus” and “COVID-19”

00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:20.770 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
have become an all-too-familiar part

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our vocabulary.

00:00:23.073 --> 00:00:26.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the world facing this pandemic,

00:00:26.342 --> 00:00:29.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everyday life for many of us

00:00:29.312 --> 00:00:34.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been disrupted in ways
we might never have imagined.

00:00:34.317 --> 00:00:38.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, sad to say, in just a short time,

00:00:38.388 --> 00:00:43.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this disease has taken
the lives of thousands.

00:00:43.193 --> 00:00:46.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know you are concerned

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the well-being
of our brothers and sisters,

00:00:49.532 --> 00:00:52.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially those living in lands

00:00:52.368 --> 00:00:57.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
most directly affected by COVID-19.

00:00:57.073 --> 00:01:01.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in this report, we’ll hear
from responsible brothers

00:01:01.745 --> 00:01:06.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Korea, Italy, and the United States

00:01:06.182 --> 00:01:09.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find out how our brothers and sisters

00:01:09.052 --> 00:01:12.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are doing and what steps are being taken

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:17.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to assist those facing
this serious health crisis.

00:01:17.794 --> 00:01:21.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But before we hear from those brothers,

00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:24.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please let me share some thoughts with you.

00:01:24.868 --> 00:01:27.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The spread of this disease

00:01:27.403 --> 00:01:31.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is distressing, to be sure.

00:01:31.074 --> 00:01:35.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we’re really not surprised
to see the world

00:01:35.078 --> 00:01:39.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the grip of such pestilence, are we?

00:01:39.315 --> 00:01:44.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus made it clear at Luke 21:11

00:01:44.154 --> 00:01:49.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that pestilence would be part
of the sign of the last days.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in Revelation chapter 6,

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:54.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the ride of the fourth horseman

00:01:54.497 --> 00:01:59.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
includes mention of “deadly plague.”

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the events unfolding around us

00:02:02.505 --> 00:02:05.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are making it clearer than ever

00:02:05.975 --> 00:02:10.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re living
in the final part of the last days

00:02:10.914 --> 00:02:15.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—undoubtedly, the final part
of the final part of the last days,

00:02:15.685 --> 00:02:20.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shortly before the last day of the last days.

00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:25.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But while the situation is serious,

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:30.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Jehovah’s people, we do not need to panic,

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:35.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Isaiah 30:15 tells us why.

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:37.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read that together.

00:02:37.874 --> 00:02:41.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 30:15:

00:02:41.711 --> 00:02:45.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah,

00:02:45.281 --> 00:02:48.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Holy One of Israel, says:

00:02:48.818 --> 00:02:53.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘By returning to me and resting,
you will be saved;

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘your strength will be

00:02:57.093 --> 00:03:01.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in keeping calm and showing trust.’”

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has always guided and supported

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his people in times of distress.

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:15.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have good reason
to do just as this verse tells us:

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:20.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Keep calm and show trust’ in Jehovah.

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:24.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, in turn, Jehovah will give us strength.

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:28.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we’ll see in these reports
from around the world,

00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:31.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has given us Bible principles

00:03:31.761 --> 00:03:35.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help his people make wise decisions,

00:03:35.365 --> 00:03:39.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even in very difficult circumstances.

00:03:39.502 --> 00:03:44.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s begin by speaking
with Brother Reino Kesk,

00:03:44.007 --> 00:03:46.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who serves in Korea.

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:49.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Reino, for joining us.

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:50.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re welcome.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a privilege.

00:03:53.216 --> 00:03:55.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we ask, Brother Kesk,

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:57.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how are the brothers in Korea

00:03:57.754 --> 00:04:00.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doing right now?

00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:03.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although there is fear

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
throughout the country,
our brothers are in good spirits

00:04:07.697 --> 00:04:09.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they really are endeavoring

00:04:09.732 --> 00:04:14.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to apply the good counsel at Isaiah 26:3

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by fully leaning on Jehovah
and by trusting in him.

00:04:20.443 --> 00:04:22.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s very good to hear.

00:04:23.613 --> 00:04:26.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How has the coronavirus pandemic

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
affected the congregation meetings

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:32.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and field ministry in your branch territory?

00:04:33.556 --> 00:04:36.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’ve had to stop holding meetings

00:04:36.092 --> 00:04:40.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the Kingdom Halls
and also stop public witnessing.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first, the brothers
were a little bit confused when this happened

00:04:45.435 --> 00:04:48.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the suddenness of everything.

00:04:48.137 --> 00:04:51.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But once they were informed
about the reasons for these steps

00:04:51.774 --> 00:04:55.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that had to be taken
and also when they understood the need

00:04:55.244 --> 00:04:57.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to apply Romans 13:1

00:04:57.847 --> 00:04:59.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(to cooperate with the
“superior authorities,”

00:04:59.682 --> 00:05:01.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the government officials),

00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:06.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they understood immediately
and started to put into practice

00:05:06.456 --> 00:05:10.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the recommendations
and the suggestions that were given.

00:05:10.293 --> 00:05:13.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they were so thankful
for these good suggestions,

00:05:13.763 --> 00:05:16.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recommendations, from the organization.

00:05:16.532 --> 00:05:19.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, those are big changes,

00:05:19.268 --> 00:05:23.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but no doubt the obedience and cooperation

00:05:23.072 --> 00:05:26.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the brothers
has reflected favorably

00:05:26.609 --> 00:05:28.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Jehovah’s name.

00:05:28.945 --> 00:05:31.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what has helped the brothers

00:05:31.714 --> 00:05:36.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maintain their peace of mind
during this time?

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:40.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the friends are still keeping
a very good spiritual routine,

00:05:40.656 --> 00:05:44.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is helping them,
and all of us, to stay calm

00:05:44.927 --> 00:05:48.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to keep a proper perspective of matters.

00:05:48.698 --> 00:05:50.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As far as meetings are concerned,

00:05:50.733 --> 00:05:54.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers are
either meeting together in small groups

00:05:54.137 --> 00:05:57.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or they’re using videoconferencing programs

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they can keep in touch
and enjoy the meetings that way

00:06:00.376 --> 00:06:02.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and also JW Stream.

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:06.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re also more flexible in their ministry.

00:06:06.816 --> 00:06:11.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re writing letters,
they’re texting their return visits,

00:06:11.387 --> 00:06:15.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re conducting
Bible studies over the telephone,

00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:19.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re calling their family and friends
to see how they are (to talk to them),

00:06:19.495 --> 00:06:21.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’re also calling
former Bible students

00:06:21.931 --> 00:06:25.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see how they are
and are able to witness this way.

00:06:25.435 --> 00:06:28.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But one other thing too I might mention,

00:06:28.271 --> 00:06:31.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that is, that the brothers
are really trying hard

00:06:31.674 --> 00:06:35.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be balanced
in how much time they’re spending

00:06:35.044 --> 00:06:39.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
watching news reports
and reading about them.

00:06:39.048 --> 00:06:41.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, it’s important, of course,

00:06:41.918 --> 00:06:44.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to stay up-to-date
with things that are going on,

00:06:44.554 --> 00:06:48.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but our brothers have found
that constantly watching

00:06:48.758 --> 00:06:51.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
news reports and updates

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can also increase undue,

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:57.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or unnecessary, anxiety.

00:06:57.567 --> 00:07:02.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a certainty, we can imitate the faith

00:07:02.572 --> 00:07:06.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our brothers
in Korea and their determination

00:07:06.976 --> 00:07:11.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to maintain
good spiritual routines during this time.

00:07:11.981 --> 00:07:16.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much
for joining us for this report.

00:07:16.986 --> 00:07:19.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been a pleasure.

00:07:19.088 --> 00:07:21.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:26.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we’ll go to Italy
with Brother Greg Cicciù.

00:07:26.462 --> 00:07:29.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for being here, Greg.

00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:32.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m glad to be here, Brother Lett.

00:07:32.268 --> 00:07:34.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:07:34.237 --> 00:07:36.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that our brothers in Italy

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:39.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are facing many of the same challenges

00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:42.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as our brothers in Korea and in recent weeks

00:07:42.912 --> 00:07:47.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have had to face
some especially difficult conditions,

00:07:47.683 --> 00:07:51.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including a nationwide lockdown.

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:56.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you please tell us
how our brothers are doing in Italy?

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:01.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, some of our brothers have contracted

00:08:01.364 --> 00:08:03.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
COVID-19 and, tragically,

00:08:03.633 --> 00:08:07.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as of March 16, six of them have died.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:10.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The vast majority of our brothers are fine.

00:08:10.006 --> 00:08:12.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re praying for all of them,
especially those

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:14.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who lost dear loved ones in death.

00:08:16.412 --> 00:08:21.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re very glad to hear
that most of the brothers are doing well,

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:26.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but our hearts go out to those
who have lost their loved ones.

00:08:27.857 --> 00:08:32.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The news media has reported
on the many restrictions in Italy right now.

00:08:33.696 --> 00:08:37.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How have our brothers
been looking after each other

00:08:37.133 --> 00:08:39.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite these restrictions?

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the brothers really miss
associating together in person but,

00:08:44.907 --> 00:08:48.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thanks to Jehovah’s blessing,
they’re doing well spiritually.

00:08:48.344 --> 00:08:52.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Jesus said at John 13:34, 35

00:08:52.014 --> 00:08:55.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that love for one another
would identify his true disciples,

00:08:55.885 --> 00:08:58.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, we’re seeing this love in action here.

00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:02.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True, government restrictions prevent us
from leaving home freely,

00:09:02.491 --> 00:09:07.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the brothers regularly keep in touch
by phone or other electronic means.

00:09:07.496 --> 00:09:11.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The result is that many are reporting 
that through this situation,

00:09:11.667 --> 00:09:16.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s actually drawing
our brothers closer together.

00:09:16.005 --> 00:09:20.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s very encouraging news.

00:09:20.109 --> 00:09:25.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please tell us what the elders
are doing to shepherd the brothers.

00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:31.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition to providing
for physical needs where possible,

00:09:31.454 --> 00:09:33.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the elders are videoconferencing

00:09:33.689 --> 00:09:37.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with individuals
and entire field service groups

00:09:37.193 --> 00:09:42.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to share Scriptural encouragement
so that no one feels isolated.

00:09:42.131 --> 00:09:45.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each one receives
emotional and spiritual support.

00:09:45.534 --> 00:09:49.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many are expressing a renewed
appreciation for their dear shepherds.

00:09:49.338 --> 00:09:51.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, one sister wrote,

00:09:51.707 --> 00:09:54.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I feel protected, like when a hen gathers

00:09:54.577 --> 00:09:57.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
her chicks to protect them from a predator.”

00:09:57.179 --> 00:10:02.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another brother said,
“I feel Jehovah’s love through my elders.”

00:10:02.184 --> 00:10:05.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as Isaiah 32:2 says,

00:10:05.154 --> 00:10:08.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our elders are really proving to be
“a hiding place from the wind,

00:10:08.791 --> 00:10:11.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[and] a place of concealment
from the rainstorm.”

00:10:11.727 --> 00:10:15.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How very encouraging!

00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:17.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re excited to hear how Jehovah

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:22.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is getting you brothers
through this difficult time.

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:26.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our prayers will continue to be with you.

00:10:26.742 --> 00:10:29.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much, Brother Lett.

00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:33.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we’ll go to the United States and speak

00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:38.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Brother Harold Corkern,
who serves in Wallkill, New York.

00:10:38.254 --> 00:10:41.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Corkern serves as a helper to the

00:10:41.157 --> 00:10:43.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Publishing Committee of the Governing Body

00:10:43.159 --> 00:10:45.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but is also a member

00:10:45.294 --> 00:10:48.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the United States Branch Committee.

00:10:48.431 --> 00:10:50.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for being with us, Harold,

00:10:50.933 --> 00:10:55.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we look forward to hearing from you.

00:10:55.304 --> 00:10:58.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for the opportunity, Brother Lett.

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:02.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why don’t you tell us how the brothers

00:11:02.545 --> 00:11:05.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at world headquarters and other

00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:09.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
United States Bethel facilities are doing?

00:11:09.852 --> 00:11:11.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there’s no question

00:11:11.987 --> 00:11:14.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re going through
some challenging times

00:11:14.523 --> 00:11:17.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we’ve never experienced

00:11:17.093 --> 00:11:20.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a health situation
like the scope of this one.

00:11:20.696 --> 00:11:22.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But on behalf of the Branch Committee,

00:11:22.965 --> 00:11:27.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re very happy to report
that the Bethel family is coping well.

00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:32.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And commendably, they have displayed
the “wisdom from above,”

00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:35.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being “ready to obey” as described

00:11:35.144 --> 00:11:38.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the book of James 3:17.

00:11:38.247 --> 00:11:40.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And likewise, our brothers in the field

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:45.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are quick to respond
to direction from the branch office.

00:11:45.388 --> 00:11:48.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s very good to hear.

00:11:48.257 --> 00:11:51.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you explain what practical steps

00:11:51.894 --> 00:11:56.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers are taking
to avoid spreading the coronavirus?

00:11:58.701 --> 00:12:02.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re taking very seriously the guidelines

00:12:02.037 --> 00:12:06.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have received
from medical and government authorities

00:12:06.675 --> 00:12:11.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding steps that can be taken
to prevent the spread of the virus.

00:12:11.414 --> 00:12:15.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are some basic reminders,
such as regular hand washing,

00:12:15.818 --> 00:12:20.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not touching the face,
avoiding hugs and handshakes,

00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:26.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and making sure to disinfect regularly
surfaces that are often touched.

00:12:27.463 --> 00:12:30.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if someone is sick,
they should stay home.

00:12:30.733 --> 00:12:34.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have emphasized
these basic reminders

00:12:34.603 --> 00:12:39.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only to our fellow workers here at Bethel
but also to those in the field.

00:12:39.575 --> 00:12:43.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those are very practical reminders.

00:12:43.813 --> 00:12:46.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even I’ve been greeting my brothers

00:12:46.682 --> 00:12:49.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with an elbow bump instead of a handshake.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you tell us what other measures

00:12:53.088 --> 00:12:55.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been taken to keep everyone

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:57.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as safe as possible?

00:12:59.195 --> 00:13:02.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as a precaution for the Bethel family,

00:13:02.731 --> 00:13:06.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our brothers in the field,
and for our neighbors,

00:13:06.969 --> 00:13:10.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no tours or guests are permitted

00:13:10.306 --> 00:13:13.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at our Bethel complexes at this time.

00:13:13.275 --> 00:13:16.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the direction of the Governing Body,

00:13:16.679 --> 00:13:21.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no guests attended in person
at the recent Gilead graduation,

00:13:21.684 --> 00:13:25.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Bethel family was directed

00:13:25.387 --> 00:13:29.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to watch the program
from their personal rooms.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now with growing concerns,

00:13:33.596 --> 00:13:36.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the most recent precaution that’s being taken

00:13:36.832 --> 00:13:39.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that the Bethel family has been directed

00:13:39.835 --> 00:13:43.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to not leave their respective complexes

00:13:43.539 --> 00:13:45.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for any activity

00:13:45.674 --> 00:13:49.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that would include shopping,

00:13:49.512 --> 00:13:53.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
social gatherings, and meetings.

00:13:53.449 --> 00:13:55.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’d like to emphasize that this

00:13:55.484 --> 00:13:58.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a precaution to protect the Bethel family,

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we do not have
an outbreak at this time,

00:14:01.156 --> 00:14:04.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we’re being extra careful
to protect them.

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:08.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we will monitor this latest restriction

00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:10.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a week-by-week basis

00:14:10.199 --> 00:14:13.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to determine
how much longer it should continue.

00:14:13.002 --> 00:14:16.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as far as the field is concerned,

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:20.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have directed
that all large theocratic events

00:14:20.409 --> 00:14:24.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
throughout the U.S. branch territory
should be canceled until May 17.

00:14:26.882 --> 00:14:30.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of the adjustments you’ve described

00:14:30.185 --> 00:14:33.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have no doubt been challenging.

00:14:33.055 --> 00:14:36.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How have the brothers responded?

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:42.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re happy to report
that they have responded very well

00:14:42.097 --> 00:14:44.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the precautions that have been provided.

00:14:44.967 --> 00:14:47.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’d also like to say, Brother Lett,

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:51.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on behalf of the Branch Committee
to you dear brothers on the Governing Body:

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:54.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much
for your loving direction.

00:14:54.643 --> 00:14:57.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can certainly sense
your loving concern

00:14:57.746 --> 00:15:00.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your tender affection.

00:15:00.015 --> 00:15:02.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So thank you very much.

00:15:02.351 --> 00:15:05.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, thank you very much, Harold.

00:15:05.454 --> 00:15:10.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll be sure to pass
that appreciation on to the other brothers.

00:15:10.459 --> 00:15:15.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve looked to Jehovah for help
in making these decisions.

00:15:15.464 --> 00:15:20.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s encouraging to see
how willing and cooperative

00:15:20.436 --> 00:15:23.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers and sisters have been.

00:15:23.272 --> 00:15:28.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much,
Brother Corkern, for sharing this update.

00:15:29.411 --> 00:15:31.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re very welcome.

00:15:31.447 --> 00:15:34.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you’ve seen from these reports,

00:15:34.984 --> 00:15:39.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the situation changing day by day
—sometimes hour by hour—

00:15:39.989 --> 00:15:43.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many adjustments have had to be made.

00:15:43.959 --> 00:15:46.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in some cases, the Governing Body

00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:48.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has provided specific direction

00:15:48.831 --> 00:15:53.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on how these adjustments
should be put into effect.

00:15:53.602 --> 00:15:56.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But many decisions have been left

00:15:56.238 --> 00:16:00.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those who are most familiar
with local circumstances:

00:16:00.976 --> 00:16:03.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Branch Committee members,

00:16:03.045 --> 00:16:07.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
circuit overseers, and congregation elders.

00:16:07.516 --> 00:16:11.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To you faithful spirit-appointed men

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
serving in these capacities,

00:16:13.889 --> 00:16:18.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’d like to say this: We trust you,

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we are confident

00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:24.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’ll prayerfully evaluate the facts

00:16:24.133 --> 00:16:26.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and local circumstances

00:16:26.135 --> 00:16:30.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and follow the direction
of the “superior authorities.”

00:16:30.839 --> 00:16:34.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that you’ll do
all within your power

00:16:34.977 --> 00:16:38.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to stay in touch with the congregations.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will do so on a regular basis

00:16:41.116 --> 00:16:45.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by phone or videoconference as necessary.

00:16:45.187 --> 00:16:48.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re also confident that Jehovah’s spirit

00:16:48.991 --> 00:16:53.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will guide you and give you
the mature judgment

00:16:53.395 --> 00:16:55.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
needed at this time

00:16:55.898 --> 00:16:58.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to apply Bible principles properly

00:16:58.967 --> 00:17:03.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to provide clear direction.

00:17:03.138 --> 00:17:08.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As for the rest of us,
whether the direction we receive comes

00:17:08.077 --> 00:17:10.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the Governing Body, the branch,

00:17:10.612 --> 00:17:13.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our circuit overseer, or the elders,

00:17:13.348 --> 00:17:18.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to follow that direction closely.

00:17:18.253 --> 00:17:23.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can serve as a protection now and, really,

00:17:23.292 --> 00:17:25.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we think about it,

00:17:25.327 --> 00:17:28.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s good practice as we head

00:17:28.397 --> 00:17:32.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into even more turbulent times ahead.

00:17:32.601 --> 00:17:37.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before we conclude,
we’d like to share a few thoughts

00:17:37.072 --> 00:17:40.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the upcoming Memorial

00:17:40.042 --> 00:17:44.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the death of Jesus Christ on April 7.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:49.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no virus or pandemic in the world

00:17:49.485 --> 00:17:53.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can dampen our appreciation

00:17:53.021 --> 00:17:56.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for what Jehovah and Jesus have done for us

00:17:56.759 --> 00:18:00.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or weaken our determination

00:18:00.362 --> 00:18:04.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to observe the Lord’s Evening Meal.

00:18:04.266 --> 00:18:07.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our gathering to commemorate

00:18:07.402 --> 00:18:12.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that important event
is more than a tradition;

00:18:12.407 --> 00:18:15.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s a command

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:18.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recorded at Luke 22:19.

00:18:18.947 --> 00:18:21.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read that together.

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:25.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Luke 22:19:

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:30.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Also, he [Jesus] took a loaf,

00:18:30.125 --> 00:18:34.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them,

00:18:34.763 --> 00:18:37.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“saying: ‘This means my body,

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘which is to be given in your behalf.

00:18:41.236 --> 00:18:46.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep doing this in remembrance of me.’”

00:18:47.643 --> 00:18:52.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So will we ‘keep doing this
in remembrance of Jesus,’ as he commanded?

00:18:53.182 --> 00:18:55.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely.

00:18:57.186 --> 00:18:59.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how we do so may vary

00:18:59.688 --> 00:19:03.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
depending on our local circumstances.

00:19:03.025 --> 00:19:05.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If it’s possible in your area,

00:19:05.928 --> 00:19:10.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we encourage you
to meet with your congregation.

00:19:10.132 --> 00:19:12.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can be sure that the elders

00:19:12.367 --> 00:19:17.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will take practical measures
for the benefit of all those attending.

00:19:17.372 --> 00:19:20.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, in some areas,

00:19:20.175 --> 00:19:24.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
local circumstances created by COVID-19

00:19:24.146 --> 00:19:27.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may prevent you
from meeting as a congregation.

00:19:27.916 --> 00:19:30.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In that case, you may receive direction

00:19:30.686 --> 00:19:34.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from your elders to meet in smaller groups;

00:19:34.857 --> 00:19:38.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to use videoconferencing,
like Skype® or Zoom;

00:19:38.627 --> 00:19:42.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or if none of those options are possible,

00:19:42.598 --> 00:19:47.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to watch the program on jw.org®.

00:19:47.002 --> 00:19:51.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How thankful we are to Jehovah

00:19:51.373 --> 00:19:55.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he’s equipped us
to be able to “drink the milk of nations”

00:19:55.711 --> 00:20:00.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as mentioned at Isaiah 60:16,

00:20:00.282 --> 00:20:05.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which includes the wise use of technology!

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:09.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regardless of the specific
arrangements involved,

00:20:09.992 --> 00:20:13.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we all want to prepare our hearts

00:20:13.929 --> 00:20:16.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and do whatever is necessary

00:20:16.231 --> 00:20:19.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to obey Jesus’ command

00:20:19.334 --> 00:20:23.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to celebrate the Lord’s Evening Meal.

00:20:23.305 --> 00:20:27.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just think for a moment
about Jesus’ sacrifice

00:20:27.743 --> 00:20:29.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what it means,

00:20:29.778 --> 00:20:34.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially in the light
of this global health crisis.

00:20:34.416 --> 00:20:39.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By means of the ransom,
Jehovah has made provision

00:20:39.021 --> 00:20:42.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to completely eliminate problems

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:45.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as pestilence from the earth

00:20:45.327 --> 00:20:48.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not just this one viral pandemic

00:20:48.263 --> 00:20:52.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but all sickness and death.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Admittedly, the events we see around us

00:20:57.005 --> 00:21:02.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are now creating
“times hard to deal with,”

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:04.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as the Bible foretold.

00:21:04.913 --> 00:21:08.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But these events also remind us

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:11.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how close we are to seeing

00:21:11.386 --> 00:21:13.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a complete solution

00:21:13.422 --> 00:21:18.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to all these problems forever.

00:21:18.126 --> 00:21:22.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want you to know that the Governing Body

00:21:22.798 --> 00:21:25.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
loves you deeply

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:29.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and will keep you in our prayers.

00:21:29.271 --> 00:21:33.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers in the United States, Italy,

00:21:33.075 --> 00:21:37.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Korea send their warm love and greetings.
