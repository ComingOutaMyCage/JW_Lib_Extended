This is our seventh video update

00:00:04.354 --> 00:00:07.524 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
since the start of the pandemic.

00:00:07.524 --> 00:00:11.761 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This one is about a very special topic

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:14.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—you precious young ones.

00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:16.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How are you doing?

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:21.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to commend you
for being active in the ministry,

00:00:21.337 --> 00:00:25.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only that but attending meetings
and reading the Bible.

00:00:25.508 --> 00:00:29.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of you have even got baptized
during the pandemic!

00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:32.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are so proud of you.

00:00:32.382 --> 00:00:35.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we’re also concerned about you.

00:00:35.385 --> 00:00:38.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve heard that many of you are struggling

00:00:38.855 --> 00:00:43.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with only seeing your friends on a screen

00:00:43.493 --> 00:00:46.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not in person.

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:50.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of you are dealing
with a lack of structure in your life.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for many of you,
even school is different now.

00:00:55.572 --> 00:00:59.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know this must be a hard time for you.

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:01.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re not alone.

00:01:01.377 --> 00:01:06.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many young ones
are facing the same challenges.

00:01:06.382 --> 00:01:08.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch this video,

00:01:08.418 --> 00:01:12.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see if you can relate
to how these young ones feel.

00:01:15.225 --> 00:01:16.392 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I struggle

00:01:16.392 --> 00:01:17.894 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with a negative attitude,

00:01:17.894 --> 00:01:20.997 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
thinking that the coronavirus will never end.

00:01:20.997 --> 00:01:23.299 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My normal routine has completely changed.

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.635 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s a very unusual situation.

00:01:25.635 --> 00:01:27.904 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
At first, I was kind of just sitting

00:01:27.904 --> 00:01:29.539 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
around all day, being lazy,

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:30.640 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
wishing I could hang out

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.408 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with my friends like I used to.

00:01:32.408 --> 00:01:36.379 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I would stay up late and sleep in,

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:39.649 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and I was losing track of time.

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.684 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Not being able to associate

00:01:41.684 --> 00:01:44.521 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with my friends has been a real challenge.

00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:45.722 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now that I’m spending

00:01:45.722 --> 00:01:47.323 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
more time with my family,

00:01:47.323 --> 00:01:49.025 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’m much more likely

00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:50.860 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to get irritated quickly.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.129 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Kids my age are always anxious

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:54.697 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when their parents go to work.

00:01:54.697 --> 00:01:55.965 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They keep thinking,

00:01:55.965 --> 00:01:57.700 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‘Are they going to get infected?’

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.369 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
One of my biggest concerns

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.204 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was that I would infect my family

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:03.139 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—especially my grandparents.

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:05.175 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When homeschooling started,

00:02:05.175 --> 00:02:06.709 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I found it very difficult

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:09.412 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to study all on my own.

00:02:09.412 --> 00:02:12.715 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I felt overwhelmed and ended up

00:02:12.715 --> 00:02:16.619 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
not being able to do anything.

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:19.088 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I struggled with telephone witnessing

00:02:19.088 --> 00:02:20.623 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because I was afraid of the reaction

00:02:20.623 --> 00:02:22.826 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I would get from people.

00:02:22.826 --> 00:02:26.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Phone witnessing is a lot scarier
than letter writing for me.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.264 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My time in the ministry

00:02:28.264 --> 00:02:29.933 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
has actually gone down.

00:02:29.933 --> 00:02:31.701 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This made me feel really sad.

00:02:31.701 --> 00:02:33.002 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When we were told

00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:34.370 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we could no longer attend

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.772 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
meetings as usual,

00:02:35.772 --> 00:02:37.340 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
it was like someone said,

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.043 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“You may not see your family!”

00:02:40.043 --> 00:02:43.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve really missed being able
to hug my brothers and sisters

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and friends from the congregation.

00:02:47.617 --> 00:02:50.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did some of those comments hit home

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with you and your family?

00:02:53.323 --> 00:02:56.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why don’t you pause this video

00:02:56.693 --> 00:03:01.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and think about it
or talk about it with your family?

00:03:01.698 --> 00:03:05.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
which of those challenges

00:03:05.235 --> 00:03:08.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did you identify with the most?

00:03:13.376 --> 00:03:18.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hope you had a good chat
about the challenges you’re dealing with.

00:03:18.314 --> 00:03:20.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We feel for you.

00:03:20.083 --> 00:03:21.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah does too.

00:03:21.885 --> 00:03:24.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows this is tough

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and has promised
to help us through difficult times.

00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:33.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read what he promised at Isaiah 41:10

00:03:34.864 --> 00:03:37.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Isaiah 41:10:

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:40.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be afraid, for I am with you.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be anxious, for I am your God.

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:50.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will fortify you, yes, I will help you,

00:03:50.246 --> 00:03:53.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will really hold on to you

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with my right hand of righteousness.”

00:03:58.187 --> 00:04:00.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you catch that?

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has got you by the hand,

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:08.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he is not going to let go
during this pandemic.

00:04:08.564 --> 00:04:11.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can give you the strength you need

00:04:11.701 --> 00:04:13.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to control your thinking

00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:17.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to make the best of your circumstances.

00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:21.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this next video,

00:04:21.177 --> 00:04:24.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
listen to what is helping other young people

00:04:24.447 --> 00:04:27.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to deal with these challenges.

00:04:29.285 --> 00:04:30.920 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
For those having a tough time,

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.155 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I would encourage them

00:04:32.155 --> 00:04:34.324 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to not look back at what they can’t do

00:04:34.324 --> 00:04:35.658 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but to look at the new opportunities

00:04:35.658 --> 00:04:36.759 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
they have now.

00:04:37.994 --> 00:04:41.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Making a plan helped me
to be organized in my daily life.

00:04:41.664 --> 00:04:45.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I made a to-do list, for example,
which was extremely helpful.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I decided I would study,

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not because my parents told me to

00:04:52.308 --> 00:04:54.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but to be able to serve Jehovah.

00:04:54.811 --> 00:04:56.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That boosted my morale.

00:04:58.014 --> 00:05:01.417 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
If I am frustrated or bored,

00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:03.920 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
doing something creative helps.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having creative outlets helped me to realize

00:05:06.522 --> 00:05:09.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I don’t need to be
with my friends all the time.

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:12.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I started painting, sewing,

00:05:12.595 --> 00:05:14.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
learning a new language and a new instrument,

00:05:14.597 --> 00:05:16.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cooking and baking a lot more.

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:19.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Arguments with my brother
—they happen.

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:23.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when we deliver food
or do good for others,

00:05:23.272 --> 00:05:26.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we both feel good about it
and we bond more.

00:05:26.342 --> 00:05:28.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talk to your parents,

00:05:28.344 --> 00:05:30.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the more you keep something inside,

00:05:30.546 --> 00:05:32.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the worse you’re going to feel.

00:05:32.015 --> 00:05:34.684 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Do not be afraid to talk about your feelings

00:05:34.684 --> 00:05:36.452 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with someone else.

00:05:36.452 --> 00:05:40.056 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s not a weakness but a sign of strength.

00:05:41.491 --> 00:05:43.493 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Whatever feelings you have

00:05:43.493 --> 00:05:44.527 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—even if sometimes

00:05:44.527 --> 00:05:46.295 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
you don’t understand them yourself—

00:05:46.295 --> 00:05:48.297 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
pour them out to Jehovah.

00:05:48.297 --> 00:05:50.633 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He will always help at the right time.

00:05:52.235 --> 00:05:53.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I talked to my parents.

00:05:53.803 --> 00:05:55.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They gave me some practical suggestions

00:05:55.938 --> 00:05:58.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on how I could spend
more time in the ministry,

00:05:58.174 --> 00:06:01.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as letter writing
and sitting in on other people’s studies.

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:07.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to talk to a friend
at school about Jehovah.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She joined one of our Zoom meetings

00:06:09.318 --> 00:06:12.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even gave a comment
during the <i>Watchtower</i>  Study,

00:06:12.088 --> 00:06:14.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which I was really happy about.

00:06:16.592 --> 00:06:18.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During this pandemic,

00:06:18.594 --> 00:06:20.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a lot of things have changed on this earth,

00:06:20.596 --> 00:06:23.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we don’t have to be afraid.

00:06:23.433 --> 00:06:25.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are not alone in this.

00:06:25.368 --> 00:06:27.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are together in this.

00:06:27.003 --> 00:06:28.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is by our side.

00:06:28.604 --> 00:06:30.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah, we can succeed,

00:06:30.873 --> 00:06:34.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will be able to enjoy
that beautiful life in Paradise.

00:06:36.913 --> 00:06:39.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you hear anything
that those young ones said

00:06:39.549 --> 00:06:41.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that might help you?

00:06:41.751 --> 00:06:46.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which solutions do you think
could work for you?

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:49.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go ahead and pause this video

00:06:49.992 --> 00:06:54.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and think about it
or talk about it with your family.

00:06:54.997 --> 00:06:57.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll give you a moment now.

00:07:01.804 --> 00:07:05.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you come up with any good ideas?

00:07:05.408 --> 00:07:07.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure you did!

00:07:07.543 --> 00:07:11.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the keys to coping with this pandemic

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is doing what it says at Philippians 1:10.

00:07:16.052 --> 00:07:17.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There we read:

00:07:17.353 --> 00:07:21.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Make sure of the more important things.”

00:07:22.625 --> 00:07:27.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are some
of those “more important things”?

00:07:27.296 --> 00:07:29.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The basics

00:07:29.332 --> 00:07:31.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the Bible reading,

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:33.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prayer,

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
field service
and, of course, family worship.

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:40.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about personal study?

00:07:40.743 --> 00:07:43.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s important too!

00:07:43.112 --> 00:07:47.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The <i>Young People Ask</i>  books
are a great place to find topics

00:07:47.617 --> 00:07:52.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that may be affecting you right now.

00:07:52.588 --> 00:07:57.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some young ones
have started reading life stories.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One young sister
reads a different one every day.

00:08:00.997 --> 00:08:03.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like traveling the globe

00:08:03.266 --> 00:08:08.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hearing firsthand
how others have dealt with challenges.

00:08:08.271 --> 00:08:09.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can find

00:08:09.772 --> 00:08:11.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those articles

00:08:11.374 --> 00:08:14.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on <i>Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY</i> ™.

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:17.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just type in “life stories.”

00:08:18.214 --> 00:08:21.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s something else to think about:

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What practical steps can we take

00:08:24.086 --> 00:08:28.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when feeling alone, or lonely?

00:08:28.357 --> 00:08:32.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember what Proverbs 18:1 says.

00:08:32.895 --> 00:08:34.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read it:

00:08:34.897 --> 00:08:38.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whoever isolates himself

00:08:38.467 --> 00:08:41.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[that is, keeps to himself] . . .

00:08:41.637 --> 00:08:45.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rejects all practical wisdom.”

00:08:46.542 --> 00:08:49.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re feeling alone,
it is “practical wisdom”

00:08:49.312 --> 00:08:52.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach out to others.

00:08:52.181 --> 00:08:56.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may find
that some good conversation or laughter

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:59.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with your friends from the congregation

00:08:59.722 --> 00:09:02.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even over the phone—

00:09:02.158 --> 00:09:05.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is just what the doctor ordered.

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:09.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another way we can show “practical wisdom” is

00:09:09.599 --> 00:09:14.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by learning from the good examples
of other young ones.

00:09:14.604 --> 00:09:19.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, some young people
are in prison for their faith;

00:09:19.208 --> 00:09:22.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
others are awaiting trial.

00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:24.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helps them to cope?

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll find out in this interview

00:09:27.316 --> 00:09:32.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Sister Darya Dulova from Russia.

00:09:32.121 --> 00:09:36.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When she was just 18,
her home was raided

00:09:36.592 --> 00:09:40.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the government
started a criminal investigation

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against her and her mom.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:51.207 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They raided our home on August 1, 2018.

00:09:51.941 --> 00:09:56.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My feelings at the time
were probably both fear and shock.

00:09:57.847 --> 00:10:01.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They told my mom that I needed
to be rescued from the mire;

00:10:02.385 --> 00:10:06.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
otherwise, I would have no future,
no job, no family—nothing.

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:12.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They opened a criminal case against me,
and I was found guilty.

00:10:12.261 --> 00:10:15.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom was given
a two-year conditional sentence,

00:10:15.064 --> 00:10:17.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I received one year.

00:10:17.066 --> 00:10:21.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After a short time, they started
another criminal case against me,

00:10:21.671 --> 00:10:23.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now these court proceedings
are ongoing.

00:10:26.242 --> 00:10:29.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was afraid that they would send
my mom and me to prison.

00:10:30.279 --> 00:10:32.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So to somehow allay the fear,

00:10:33.215 --> 00:10:36.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to spend more time in personal study.

00:10:36.552 --> 00:10:39.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That way, even if they did imprison me,

00:10:39.422 --> 00:10:41.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would have more to meditate on.

00:10:41.824 --> 00:10:46.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Chronicles 20:17 encouraged me.

00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:49.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says:
“Take your position,

00:10:49.098 --> 00:10:52.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stand still, and see the salvation
of Jehovah in your behalf.”

00:10:52.535 --> 00:10:56.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means not just entrusting
Jehovah with your problems,

00:10:57.239 --> 00:11:00.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it also means,
you know, waiting for him to act.

00:11:00.843 --> 00:11:04.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the convention that took place
shortly before we were raided,

00:11:04.714 --> 00:11:06.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was an interesting point made

00:11:06.982 --> 00:11:10.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how humans
are actually 80 percent water.

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:13.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when they took me
into the interrogation room,

00:11:13.356 --> 00:11:16.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I sat down and looked at the interrogator.

00:11:16.258 --> 00:11:19.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in my mind, I drew a dotted line

00:11:19.061 --> 00:11:22.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and filled him up with 80 percent water.

00:11:22.365 --> 00:11:24.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when he started saying things like,

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Dasha, you’ve got no future,”

00:11:26.869 --> 00:11:30.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all I saw was him filling up with water.

00:11:30.239 --> 00:11:33.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In short, his threats didn’t bother me.

00:11:34.243 --> 00:11:37.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because I felt Jehovah’s support
during those trials,

00:11:37.446 --> 00:11:40.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m no longer afraid to face new ones.

00:11:40.316 --> 00:11:42.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am sure that Jehovah will support me.

00:11:42.351 --> 00:11:45.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His care may not come in a way that I expect,

00:11:45.087 --> 00:11:48.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I know that it will always be
in a way that glorifies him.

00:11:48.891 --> 00:11:52.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s a guarantee
that everything will be OK for me.

00:11:58.033 --> 00:12:00.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t it encouraging to see

00:12:00.035 --> 00:12:05.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how Darya has kept her integrity
and defended her faith?

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:09.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’ve enjoyed talking to you young ones,

00:12:09.478 --> 00:12:13.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I’d like to talk
to the rest of the family for a moment,

00:12:13.449 --> 00:12:16.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since this pandemic
has brought challenges to them too.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:22.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Parents, many of you
have been busier than ever,

00:12:22.091 --> 00:12:25.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
supporting your children
with their remote schooling

00:12:25.561 --> 00:12:28.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while also working
and maintaining your homes

00:12:28.931 --> 00:12:33.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and keeping up
with your schedule of theocratic activities.

00:12:33.402 --> 00:12:36.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re trying to juggle it all.

00:12:36.872 --> 00:12:38.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love you for it.

00:12:38.874 --> 00:12:41.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah does too.

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:45.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s going to help us all get through this

00:12:45.514 --> 00:12:48.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a good spiritual routine.

00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:51.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Parents, we commend you

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for keeping family worship regular.

00:12:54.557 --> 00:12:57.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From time to time, can you include

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:01.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some extended family members or friends

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:05.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by videoconference or by telephone?

00:13:05.234 --> 00:13:09.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ll love that also, and so will you.

00:13:09.405 --> 00:13:13.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It warms our hearts
to see all that you young ones

00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:17.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are doing to stay close to Jehovah
during this time.

00:13:17.713 --> 00:13:20.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In spite of all that’s going on,

00:13:20.583 --> 00:13:24.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re continuing to grow spiritually.

00:13:24.353 --> 00:13:26.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re very proud of you,

00:13:26.522 --> 00:13:31.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you can be sure
that Jehovah is proud of you too.

00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:37.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to extend the warm love
of the Governing Body

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:39.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to every one of you.
