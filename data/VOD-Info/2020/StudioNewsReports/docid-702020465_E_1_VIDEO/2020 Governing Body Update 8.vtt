“Keep on the watch.”

00:00:04.454 --> 00:00:07.390 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That’s what Jesus told his disciples

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.459 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
after describing the events

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:11.761 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the last days.

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:15.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How long have you been keeping on the watch?

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:17.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re certainly experiencing

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:21.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“critical times hard to deal with.”

00:00:21.304 --> 00:00:23.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are the conditions

00:00:23.306 --> 00:00:26.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve been preaching about for years.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this update, let’s review

00:00:29.746 --> 00:00:32.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of the prophecies being fulfilled 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:34.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right before our eyes

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:37.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reflect on the timeliness

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the November campaign
publicizing God’s Kingdom.

00:00:43.226 --> 00:00:48.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, think about the sign
Jesus gave his disciples.

00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:51.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Luke 21:11, Jesus said

00:00:51.534 --> 00:00:55.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would see “food shortages and pestilences”

00:00:55.371 --> 00:00:58.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in one place after another.”

00:00:58.541 --> 00:01:01.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we are now experiencing

00:01:01.444 --> 00:01:04.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the fulfillment of this part of the sign

00:01:04.247 --> 00:01:06.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a very pronounced way.

00:01:07.984 --> 00:01:10.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A second prophecy to consider

00:01:10.086 --> 00:01:12.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is recorded in Daniel chapter 2.

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:17.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There we read
about an immense image representing

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a succession of human kingdoms

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the Babylonian Empire down to today.

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The feet and toes at the bottom of that image

00:01:29.038 --> 00:01:32.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
represent the Anglo-American World Power,

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:34.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Daniel tells us

00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:38.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they are “partly of iron and partly of clay.”

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:42.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember what this mix of hard iron

00:01:42.485 --> 00:01:45.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and soft clay represents?

00:01:45.255 --> 00:01:50.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The clay pictures
the radical and popular elements

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:53.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
within the sphere
of the United States and Britain

00:01:53.763 --> 00:01:56.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that weaken its ability to act

00:01:56.966 --> 00:01:59.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with ironlike strength.

00:02:00.703 --> 00:02:03.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel 2:43 says:

00:02:03.273 --> 00:02:06.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will not stick together,
one to the other.”

00:02:09.078 --> 00:02:12.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  of June 15, 2012,

00:02:12.482 --> 00:02:15.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pointed out clear evidence

00:02:15.118 --> 00:02:18.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the iron and clay when it said:

00:02:18.288 --> 00:02:21.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Opposing ideologies

00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:23.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and close election results

00:02:23.293 --> 00:02:27.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that do not end up in a clear majority

00:02:27.163 --> 00:02:29.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“have weakened the power base

00:02:29.332 --> 00:02:31.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of even popular leaders,

00:02:31.334 --> 00:02:34.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that they have no clear mandate

00:02:34.504 --> 00:02:36.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to implement their policies.”

00:02:38.141 --> 00:02:41.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you agree that this is more evident now

00:02:41.277 --> 00:02:44.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than eight years ago when this was published?

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reflecting on the fulfillment
of Bible prophecy

00:02:49.285 --> 00:02:54.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we are seeing right now
can fortify our faith.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following interview,

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:01.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Richard Kelsey,
who was baptized in 1941,

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:04.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shares his thoughts about what’s helped him

00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:09.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep on the watch for some 80 years.

00:03:10.406 --> 00:03:13.409 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was baptized in June 1941

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.178 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in Des Moines, Iowa,

00:03:15.178 --> 00:03:17.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the same time as Peggy,

00:03:17.647 --> 00:03:21.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we were baptized
in a horse watering tank there.

00:03:21.084 --> 00:03:24.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this was shortly
before the international convention

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:26.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in St. Louis, Missouri.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We, as youngsters and children,

00:03:29.392 --> 00:03:31.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were all asked to sit in the first rows

00:03:31.928 --> 00:03:35.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in front of the stage, and Brother Rutherford

00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:38.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gave the talk “Children of the King.”

00:03:38.334 --> 00:03:40.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And during this talk

00:03:40.737 --> 00:03:42.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the conclusion, he said,

00:03:42.772 --> 00:03:45.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘There is a new book, the <i>Children </i> book,

00:03:45.241 --> 00:03:47.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will all get a free copy.’

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:49.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That motivated me greatly.

00:03:49.746 --> 00:03:52.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, when it was studied later,

00:03:52.415 --> 00:03:56.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was even a greater motivation
to serve Jehovah.

00:03:56.286 --> 00:04:00.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started pioneering in September 1948,

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I had already auxiliary pioneered
and, of course, that whetted

00:04:05.094 --> 00:04:08.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my appetite for full-time service.

00:04:08.197 --> 00:04:12.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see world conditions worsening,
and that could frighten us.

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:16.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could be that faithful older ones
could become discouraged

00:04:16.272 --> 00:04:19.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after many years, and it’s very important

00:04:19.575 --> 00:04:23.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have a close relationship with Jehovah

00:04:23.112 --> 00:04:25.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—an intimate relationship.

00:04:25.148 --> 00:04:27.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We look forward to his Kingdom rule

00:04:27.583 --> 00:04:30.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a solution for all problems.

00:04:30.086 --> 00:04:33.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Young ones will see the faithfulness

00:04:33.856 --> 00:04:36.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the older ones and will want

00:04:36.092 --> 00:04:38.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to imitate their faith.

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:41.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, that’s pleasing to Jehovah.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when we heard that there was going

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be a special campaign now,

00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:48.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peggy and I—my wife and I—applied

00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:51.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for auxiliary pioneer service.

00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:54.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have been preaching
God’s Kingdom for many years,

00:04:55.878 --> 00:04:58.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now there is a special campaign

00:04:58.281 --> 00:05:01.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
devoted to that subject, God’s Kingdom.

00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:03.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s going to be a highlight

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our many years of service to Jehovah.

00:05:08.157 --> 00:05:10.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Brother Kelsey,

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:13.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has your confidence in Jehovah’s promises

00:05:13.296 --> 00:05:17.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
been strengthened
by what you see happening today?

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People around the world realize

00:05:20.103 --> 00:05:23.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how unusual it is to have a pandemic,

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
food shortages, civil unrest, earthquakes,

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other disasters
all occur at the same time.

00:05:31.881 --> 00:05:36.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Watching the fulfillment
of Bible prophecies builds our confidence

00:05:36.686 --> 00:05:40.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in other prophecies yet to be fulfilled

00:05:40.056 --> 00:05:43.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—prophecies that promise permanent relief

00:05:43.359 --> 00:05:45.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the problems we’re dealing with.

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
as Daniel 2:44 tells us,

00:05:51.034 --> 00:05:55.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
soon God’s Kingdom
will become the only government

00:05:55.138 --> 00:05:58.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ruling over the earth—forever!

00:05:59.342 --> 00:06:03.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t it exciting that,
amidst these critical times,

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:06.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re participating in a special campaign

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:11.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
clearly pointing people
to the only real solution,

00:06:11.554 --> 00:06:13.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Kingdom?

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:17.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some who were once associated
with Jehovah’s organization

00:06:17.894 --> 00:06:22.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are also recognizing
the fulfillment of Bible prophecy

00:06:22.598 --> 00:06:25.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have been motivated to come back.

00:06:25.902 --> 00:06:29.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you are inactive or disfellowshipped,

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:34.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we encourage you to speak to the elders
in your local congregation;

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:37.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’ll be happy to assist you.

00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:40.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’d like a copy of this magazine,

00:06:40.716 --> 00:06:44.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please go to our website, jw.org,

and download it or ask any one
of Jehovah’s Witnesses for a copy.

Just a few days
into the November campaign,

00:06:55.098 --> 00:06:59.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a sister in France
got a call from a telemarketer.

00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:01.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s listen as Brother Bruno Faure

00:07:01.471 --> 00:07:03.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
explains how she took advantage

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the opportunity to advertise the Kingdom.

00:08:59.589 --> 00:09:03.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, the zealous efforts
of our brothers in France 

00:09:03.693 --> 00:09:08.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and around the world
are resulting in a great witness.

00:09:08.698 --> 00:09:11.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many people are surprised to see

00:09:11.167 --> 00:09:15.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how quickly things have changed in 2020.

00:09:15.238 --> 00:09:20.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just a few months ago,
life was very different.

00:09:20.109 --> 00:09:22.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a very good lesson for us

00:09:22.612 --> 00:09:25.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on how fast things can change in the future.

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:34.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Matthew 24:42,

00:09:34.423 --> 00:09:37.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice what Jesus said about the suddenness

00:09:37.793 --> 00:09:42.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of these events that would occur
and how we should react.

00:09:43.633 --> 00:09:48.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 24:42-44 says:

“Keep on the watch, therefore,
