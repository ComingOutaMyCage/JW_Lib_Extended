These are challenging times, aren’t they?

00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:06.923 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Think of the challenges

00:00:06.923 --> 00:00:09.292 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
this pandemic has created.

00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:11.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has closed down businesses,

00:00:11.294 --> 00:00:13.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
delayed school openings,

00:00:13.296 --> 00:00:15.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
postponed sporting events, and more,

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it has not stopped
the flow of spiritual food.

00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:22.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus knew long ago that his followers

00:00:22.806 --> 00:00:25.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would find themselves in the time of the end,

00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:28.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
facing the most distressing period
in human history.

00:00:28.645 --> 00:00:30.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he assured them

00:00:30.647 --> 00:00:32.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that through a faithful slave

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:35.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would receive “food at the proper time,”

00:00:35.185 --> 00:00:37.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which would give them hope

00:00:37.187 --> 00:00:40.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and strengthen them to endure.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True, we’ve had to adjust

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:45.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how we prepare and serve this spiritual food.

00:00:45.328 --> 00:00:47.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, we’ve continued to receive

00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:50.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the <i>Watchtower</i>  and <i>Awake!</i>  magazines,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meeting workbooks,
new original songs and videos,

00:00:53.536 --> 00:00:55.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an entire convention program,

00:00:55.872 --> 00:00:58.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even the release
of the <i>New World Translation </i>

00:00:58.708 --> 00:01:00.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in more languages.

00:01:01.444 --> 00:01:05.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is exactly
what Jehovah promised he would provide,

00:01:05.014 --> 00:01:09.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as stated at Isaiah 65:13:

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:14.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore this is
what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says:

00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:18.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Look! My servants will eat,

00:01:18.194 --> 00:01:20.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘but you will go hungry.

00:01:20.196 --> 00:01:23.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Look! My servants will drink,

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:25.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘but you will go thirsty.

00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:28.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Look! My servants will rejoice,

00:01:28.872 --> 00:01:31.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you will suffer shame.’”

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those words aren’t just a reassurance;

00:01:35.545 --> 00:01:37.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re a promise.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite all the chaos in the world around us,

00:01:40.383 --> 00:01:44.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will have the spiritual food
that we need to stay strong.

00:01:44.921 --> 00:01:47.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you might wonder:

00:01:47.157 --> 00:01:50.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What adjustments
has the Governing Body made

00:01:50.126 --> 00:01:54.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘to provide spiritual food
at the proper time despite the pandemic?

00:01:55.832 --> 00:01:59.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How have we seen
Jehovah’s blessing on these adjustments?

00:01:59.702 --> 00:02:02.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘And on a personal level,

00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:04.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘what can each one of us do

00:02:04.641 --> 00:02:07.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show our appreciation
for these provisions?’

00:02:09.445 --> 00:02:12.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Restrictions and lockdowns
haven’t stopped the work

00:02:12.916 --> 00:02:16.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of writing and publishing
spiritually upbuilding food.

00:02:16.986 --> 00:02:21.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One example of this is the recent update
to the study edition

00:02:21.324 --> 00:02:24.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the <i>New World Translation </i>
<i>of the Holy Scriptures.</i>

00:02:25.028 --> 00:02:28.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Galatians and Ephesians
are now available in English,

00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:31.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with over 340 new study notes,

00:02:31.734 --> 00:02:34.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a video, media gallery items,

00:02:34.704 --> 00:02:36.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and new articles in the Appendix.

00:02:37.941 --> 00:02:41.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how about the jw.org® website?

00:02:41.778 --> 00:02:45.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers have been
hard at work there too.

00:02:45.148 --> 00:02:47.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Articles such as

00:02:47.617 --> 00:02:50.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What Does the Bible Say About Pandemics?”

00:02:51.387 --> 00:02:54.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “How to Deal With Isolation”
have been added.

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:58.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Other articles about distance learning,

00:02:58.127 --> 00:03:02.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
domestic abuse, and alcohol consumption
have also been added

00:03:02.732 --> 00:03:06.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the very issues
that are on many people’s minds right now.

00:03:08.538 --> 00:03:13.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How has the pandemic affected the production
of our various video projects?

00:03:13.543 --> 00:03:15.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you can imagine,

00:03:15.778 --> 00:03:18.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Bethel facilities on lockdown

00:03:18.181 --> 00:03:21.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with physical distancing
measures in place,

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:25.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve had to rethink
how videos can be safely produced.

00:03:25.822 --> 00:03:28.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video report,

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:32.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Bob Batko, a member
of the Central America Branch Committee,

00:03:32.662 --> 00:03:36.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
explains adjustments
the regional video team has made.

00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:40.503 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
To keep the cameras rolling,

00:03:40.503 --> 00:03:41.671 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the regional video team

00:03:41.671 --> 00:03:42.839 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
hosted here at the branch

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:45.975 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
had to overcome some pretty big challenges.

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:48.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of them was casting.

00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:52.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We couldn’t invite local brothers and sisters
to come in to play roles,

00:03:52.682 --> 00:03:57.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor could the Bethel team
go out to shoot on location.

00:03:57.553 --> 00:04:00.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what did it require?

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Adapting to the local circumstances.

00:04:03.693 --> 00:04:07.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That meant shooting on Bethel property

00:04:07.063 --> 00:04:09.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Bethel personnel.

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:12.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that may seem limiting,

00:04:12.535 --> 00:04:16.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they found a solution—the green screen.

00:04:16.572 --> 00:04:19.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That meant that they could shoot in studio

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the actor could virtually be anywhere.

00:04:25.748 --> 00:04:30.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When working on a set here,
rigorous safety precautions need to be taken.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cast and crew members
get their temperature checked

00:04:33.056 --> 00:04:35.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the beginning and the end of each day.

00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:37.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And everyone (everyone)

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wears face masks, including the actors

00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:42.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—unless they’re being filmed.

00:04:42.332 --> 00:04:45.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The actors maintain physical distancing

00:04:45.301 --> 00:04:47.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when with anyone
other than their mate or roommate.

00:04:48.972 --> 00:04:52.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To minimize contact
with the hair and makeup team,

00:04:52.408 --> 00:04:55.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’ve taken advantage of videoconferencing.

00:04:55.278 --> 00:04:58.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they would teach the wives
how to put beards

00:04:58.414 --> 00:05:01.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on their husbands in their Bethel rooms.

00:05:01.117 --> 00:05:04.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This way, only touch-ups
need to be done on set,

00:05:04.487 --> 00:05:08.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even then,
personal protective equipment is used.

00:05:08.324 --> 00:05:12.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And everything is disinfected
before and after each session.

00:05:13.463 --> 00:05:18.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In doing all of this,
there was a wonderful spirit of unity.

00:05:18.334 --> 00:05:22.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the lockdown,
no commuters have been able to come in;

00:05:23.673 --> 00:05:27.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so, many from other Bethel departments
have been made available

00:05:27.176 --> 00:05:29.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help with the work.

00:05:29.078 --> 00:05:30.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some are helping on the production team,

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
others by sewing wardrobes and building sets.

00:05:35.284 --> 00:05:37.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And nobody went hungry.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All the meals were provided.

00:05:41.324 --> 00:05:44.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In all of this, it’s obvious
that Jehovah blessed

00:05:44.027 --> 00:05:48.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just these arrangements
but also the Governing Body

00:05:48.164 --> 00:05:51.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they could provide
the much needed spiritual food

00:05:51.968 --> 00:05:54.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right on time.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you can see,

00:05:59.142 --> 00:06:02.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve had to adjust
many aspects of video production,

00:06:02.678 --> 00:06:06.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re grateful
for the hard work of all involved.

00:06:06.315 --> 00:06:09.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, all of our video teams,

00:06:09.485 --> 00:06:11.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including the ones at world headquarters,

00:06:11.921 --> 00:06:15.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are taking similar steps
to keep production going

00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:17.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while remaining safe.

00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:20.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But do you see the point?

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The menu of spiritual food
prepared well before the pandemic

00:06:24.834 --> 00:06:28.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be presented just as planned.

00:06:28.204 --> 00:06:30.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might say that we’ve had to adjust some

00:06:30.873 --> 00:06:34.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the “kitchen utensils”
and “cooking methods,”

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:39.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the meal itself
is unchanged and just as nourishing.

00:06:39.215 --> 00:06:41.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you won’t miss a thing!

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:46.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another vital part of the process
in providing spiritual food

00:06:46.456 --> 00:06:50.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah’s people worldwide is translation.

00:06:50.526 --> 00:06:53.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that hasn’t stopped either.

00:06:53.096 --> 00:06:56.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Translation teams
have been able to continue their work

00:06:56.766 --> 00:06:58.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by videoconference,

00:06:58.801 --> 00:07:01.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the results have been thrilling.

00:07:01.904 --> 00:07:06.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, since the start of the pandemic,

00:07:06.008 --> 00:07:09.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the <i>New World Translation</i>  has been released

00:07:09.212 --> 00:07:14.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in whole or in part in 19 languages.

00:07:14.117 --> 00:07:17.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of these releases had been planned

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in conjunction with regional conventions

00:07:20.156 --> 00:07:22.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were to be held later this year.

00:07:22.792 --> 00:07:25.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when the decision was made

00:07:25.261 --> 00:07:29.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to present
a global convention program by video,

00:07:29.332 --> 00:07:34.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Teaching Committee asked
if these newly translated Bibles

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:38.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could be released
before the convention began in July.

00:07:38.641 --> 00:07:42.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That way, translators
could use the new Bibles

00:07:42.645 --> 00:07:45.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when translating the convention program,

00:07:45.414 --> 00:07:49.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and publishers could follow along
with all six sessions

00:07:49.619 --> 00:07:52.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
using their newly released Bibles.

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:56.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, through a tremendous effort

00:07:56.659 --> 00:07:59.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with Jehovah’s blessing,

00:07:59.428 --> 00:08:02.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
13 Bibles were released in digital format

00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:05.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at special meetings

00:08:05.034 --> 00:08:07.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the weeks leading up to the convention.

00:08:07.837 --> 00:08:10.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can imagine how thrilled the brothers were

00:08:10.706 --> 00:08:14.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to receive these Bibles
in their local languages

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just in time for the convention.

00:08:18.514 --> 00:08:23.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of those new translations
was in the Oromo language.

00:08:23.152 --> 00:08:27.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this video report,
Brother Delroy Williamson,

00:08:27.557 --> 00:08:30.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a member of the Ethiopia Branch Committee,

00:08:30.159 --> 00:08:32.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
describes the challenges that they faced

00:08:32.962 --> 00:08:36.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how they overcame them
with Jehovah’s help.

00:08:37.967 --> 00:08:39.969 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We were very excited to learn

00:08:39.969 --> 00:08:42.605 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that despite the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:44.674 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the complete <i>New World Translation </i>

00:08:44.674 --> 00:08:46.676 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
would be released digitally

00:08:46.676 --> 00:08:48.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Oromo language.

00:08:48.678 --> 00:08:50.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So all congregations in Ethiopia

00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:53.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were invited to attend a special meeting,

00:08:53.115 --> 00:08:57.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which would be streamed countrywide
over the Internet.

00:08:57.019 --> 00:09:00.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But just five days before the release date,

00:09:00.056 --> 00:09:02.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
civil unrest broke out in the country,

00:09:02.658 --> 00:09:07.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and because of this,
the government shut down the Internet.

00:09:07.396 --> 00:09:10.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Suddenly, there was no way
to access the program online.

00:09:12.168 --> 00:09:15.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this is where we really saw
Jehovah’s hand in matters.

00:09:15.771 --> 00:09:17.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the program was being planned,

00:09:17.773 --> 00:09:19.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Branch Committee received approval

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:22.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prerecord the released talks

00:09:22.345 --> 00:09:25.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to broadcast the program via satellite.

00:09:25.781 --> 00:09:27.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This would enable the meeting

00:09:27.783 --> 00:09:30.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach the most distant parts
of our branch territory.

00:09:31.954 --> 00:09:36.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that satellite broadcast
became the main way

00:09:36.959 --> 00:09:40.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for over 12,000 of our brothers
to view the special meeting.

00:09:40.363 --> 00:09:43.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the areas of the country
not covered by the satellite,

00:09:43.766 --> 00:09:46.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers listened
to the program by telephone.

00:09:46.936 --> 00:09:51.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just two days after the program,
Internet access was restored

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the brothers with an Internet connection
downloaded the Bible

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:58.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then transferred the file
to those without Internet access.

00:09:58.948 --> 00:10:01.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was really faith-strengthening to see

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:05.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how despite a pandemic, despite unrest,

00:10:05.888 --> 00:10:09.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite the country being
in a state of emergency,

00:10:09.125 --> 00:10:12.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our spiritual food supply continued to flow.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:19.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a blessing
for our Oromo-speaking brothers and sisters!

00:10:19.235 --> 00:10:22.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides new Bibles, our translation teams

00:10:22.905 --> 00:10:25.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have also been busy with other projects.

00:10:25.841 --> 00:10:30.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
the 2020 Governing Body Update Reports,

00:10:30.413 --> 00:10:33.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as the one you’re watching right now,

00:10:33.015 --> 00:10:37.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been a landmark
in simultaneous communication.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second report was uploaded

00:10:40.222 --> 00:10:43.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in about 400 languages simultaneously.

00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:47.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the largest simultaneous
multilanguage video release

00:10:47.763 --> 00:10:49.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our history.

00:10:49.932 --> 00:10:53.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this turned out to be a dry run

00:10:53.436 --> 00:10:55.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for an even bigger task:

00:10:55.805 --> 00:10:58.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first day

00:10:58.207 --> 00:11:01.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the 2020 “Always Rejoice”! Convention

00:11:01.143 --> 00:11:05.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was also uploaded in about 400 languages

00:11:05.047 --> 00:11:08.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
within 24 hours of English.

00:11:09.485 --> 00:11:12.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Preparing translations for every talk

00:11:12.121 --> 00:11:16.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a massive effort
on a very tight schedule.

00:11:17.259 --> 00:11:21.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many local brothers
used their own resources to assist

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:25.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and worked tirelessly
to provide quality translations.

00:11:25.501 --> 00:11:27.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In many cases,

00:11:27.503 --> 00:11:31.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the dubbing of the talks
was so well synced

00:11:31.073 --> 00:11:33.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that some brothers actually thought

00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:36.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the talks were being delivered
in their language.

00:11:36.712 --> 00:11:39.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s just one example from Kenya

00:11:39.749 --> 00:11:41.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Kikamba language.

00:12:02.004 --> 00:12:06.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, don’t be fooled:
Brother Schafer hasn’t mastered Kikamba.

00:12:07.743 --> 00:12:11.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But thanks to the skills
of our translation team,

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:15.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the results were convincing enough
for some to say,

00:12:15.117 --> 00:12:18.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It’s so wonderful that these brothers
learned our language!”

00:12:19.655 --> 00:12:23.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, regarding all this work
being done in writing,

00:12:23.626 --> 00:12:26.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
video production, translation, and more,

00:12:26.662 --> 00:12:28.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we might ask,

00:12:28.664 --> 00:12:33.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How has all this been possible,
especially now?’

00:12:33.569 --> 00:12:35.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We find the answer

00:12:35.938 --> 00:12:40.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Zechariah 4:6:

00:12:40.976 --> 00:12:45.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Not by a military force, nor by power,

00:12:45.347 --> 00:12:49.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but by my spirit,’ says Jehovah of armies.”

00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:55.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
None of this would be possible
without Jehovah’s holy spirit.

00:12:56.959 --> 00:12:59.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we all show appreciation

00:12:59.395 --> 00:13:04.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the way we’re being spiritually fed
during this difficult time?

00:13:04.033 --> 00:13:06.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider three ways.

00:13:06.869 --> 00:13:10.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First and foremost, take full advantage

00:13:10.439 --> 00:13:13.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of this spiritual banquet
that Jehovah is providing.

00:13:13.843 --> 00:13:16.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read the Bible every day;

00:13:16.378 --> 00:13:18.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to the extent that you can,

00:13:18.714 --> 00:13:21.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
read each new magazine and publication

00:13:21.851 --> 00:13:25.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and watch each new video available
in your language.

00:13:26.422 --> 00:13:31.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not long ago,
receiving our spiritual food digitally

00:13:31.093 --> 00:13:33.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would’ve been hard to even imagine,

00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:38.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet now we probably wonder
how we’d be coping with this pandemic

00:13:38.834 --> 00:13:42.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without tools like <i>JW Library</i>®.

00:13:42.037 --> 00:13:45.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has been preparing us over the years

00:13:45.441 --> 00:13:48.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be ready for something like this.

00:13:48.511 --> 00:13:52.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even the older ones in our congregation
have gotten more comfortable

00:13:52.615 --> 00:13:55.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their electronic devices.

00:13:55.618 --> 00:14:00.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though some of our brothers
have very limited access to this technology,

00:14:00.623 --> 00:14:03.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just think about how much these tools

00:14:03.692 --> 00:14:06.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are helping us as an organization

00:14:06.028 --> 00:14:09.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to study, share, and distribute God’s Word

00:14:09.598 --> 00:14:11.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the face of this crisis.

00:14:13.002 --> 00:14:15.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keeping ourselves well-fed spiritually

00:14:15.804 --> 00:14:18.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help us to focus our minds

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:20.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on what Paul described

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:23.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Philippians 4:8:

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:28.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whatever things are of serious concern,

00:14:28.884 --> 00:14:31.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are righteous,

00:14:31.487 --> 00:14:33.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are chaste,

00:14:33.822 --> 00:14:36.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are lovable,

00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:38.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are well-spoken-of,

00:14:38.894 --> 00:14:41.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are virtuous,

00:14:41.397 --> 00:14:44.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and whatever things are praiseworthy,

00:14:44.166 --> 00:14:48.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
continue considering these things.”

00:14:49.672 --> 00:14:53.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, we can show our appreciation

00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:57.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by praying for those working hard
to support the Kingdom work

00:14:57.212 --> 00:15:00.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at world headquarters and in the branches

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:04.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and remote translation offices
around the world.

00:15:04.086 --> 00:15:09.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many Bethel families
have been on lockdown for over five months.

00:15:09.091 --> 00:15:14.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our Bethel family members
have willingly obeyed the direction given

00:15:14.029 --> 00:15:19.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to protect the Kingdom work
and the flow of spiritual food.

00:15:19.034 --> 00:15:21.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re very proud of them

00:15:21.503 --> 00:15:24.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and truly appreciate their cooperation

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as that of their families
and congregations.

00:15:29.211 --> 00:15:33.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Third, we can be generous
with our spiritual food.

00:15:33.716 --> 00:15:35.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have a full share

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:38.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in preaching and teaching
despite the limitations

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re facing right now.

00:15:41.991 --> 00:15:46.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, if you find a verse you love
in your Bible reading

00:15:46.362 --> 00:15:50.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a point that stands out
in an article or video,

00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:52.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t keep it to yourself.

00:15:52.401 --> 00:15:55.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Share the good things Jehovah has given us

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with your brothers and sisters.

00:15:58.607 --> 00:16:03.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One aspect
of our spiritual food is our songs.

00:16:03.479 --> 00:16:05.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While you may have missed singing together

00:16:05.648 --> 00:16:08.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at your meetings or the convention,

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers and sisters

00:16:10.085 --> 00:16:14.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are still finding ways
to sing together—virtually.

00:16:14.923 --> 00:16:19.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The following video clip
of the song “Our Joy Eternally”

00:16:19.762 --> 00:16:22.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was made by brothers and sisters

00:16:22.064 --> 00:16:24.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
serving as remote volunteers in France

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while they were under lockdown.

00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:31.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each person recorded
his or her part individually,

00:16:31.106 --> 00:16:33.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then they were edited together

00:16:33.876 --> 00:16:37.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to create one virtual chorus.

00:17:52.888 --> 00:17:55.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure you’d agree that

00:17:55.224 --> 00:17:58.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was a very refreshing way
to end our program.

00:17:58.961 --> 00:18:02.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our love for Jehovah
and our determination

00:18:02.564 --> 00:18:06.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to live by his standards
are being tested each day.
