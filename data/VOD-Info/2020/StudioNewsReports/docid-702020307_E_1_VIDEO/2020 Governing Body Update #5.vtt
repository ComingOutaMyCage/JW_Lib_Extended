This global pandemic has thrown the world

00:00:04.721 --> 00:00:07.223 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
into a state of uncertainty,

00:00:07.223 --> 00:00:10.260 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with so many unknowns.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there’s one thing that we <i>do</i>  know:

00:00:13.363 --> 00:00:15.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through it all,

00:00:15.365 --> 00:00:19.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has really been taking care of us.

00:00:19.069 --> 00:00:23.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Day after day,
brothers around the world tell us

00:00:23.173 --> 00:00:27.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they truly feel
that Jehovah and his organization

00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:30.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are watching over them.

00:00:30.246 --> 00:00:32.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It makes me think of the scripture

00:00:32.682 --> 00:00:35.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Isaiah 40:11:

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Like a shepherd he will care for his flock.

00:00:41.357 --> 00:00:43.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“With his arm

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:46.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he will gather together the lambs,

00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:49.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and in his bosom he will carry them.

00:00:49.632 --> 00:00:51.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He will gently lead

00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:53.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those nursing their young.”

00:00:55.004 --> 00:00:57.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that how you feel,

00:00:57.607 --> 00:01:02.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like a lamb in the protective arms
of our heavenly Father?

00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:08.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we as members of the Governing Body
feel exactly the same way!

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:13.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of us are getting
through this challenging time,

00:01:13.456 --> 00:01:18.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thanks to the tender and loving care
of our heavenly Father.

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:21.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As that tender Shepherd,

00:01:21.731 --> 00:01:26.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah does more than just take
note of our problems.

00:01:26.402 --> 00:01:30.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He looks for ways to help us.

00:01:30.106 --> 00:01:32.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Psalm 37:5 says:

00:01:32.942 --> 00:01:36.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Commit your way to Jehovah;

00:01:36.146 --> 00:01:38.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“rely on him,

00:01:38.314 --> 00:01:42.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will act in your behalf.”

00:01:42.585 --> 00:01:46.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One way that Jehovah ‘acts in our behalf’

00:01:46.222 --> 00:01:51.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is by motivating his people
to help those in need.

00:01:51.161 --> 00:01:55.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this report,
we’d like to share some examples

00:01:55.265 --> 00:01:59.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how our brothers and sisters
are doing just that.

00:01:59.636 --> 00:02:01.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some parts of the world,

00:02:01.938 --> 00:02:05.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one of the foremost concerns
our brothers have

00:02:05.642 --> 00:02:09.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is simply getting enough to eat.

00:02:09.512 --> 00:02:12.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Extremely limited food supplies,

00:02:12.315 --> 00:02:17.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lockdowns, widespread unemployment,
and other problems

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have left families with little or no food.

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:24.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Coordinators’ Committee 
of the Governing Body

00:02:24.928 --> 00:02:27.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been doing all it can to help provide

00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:32.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
food and basic medicine to those brothers.

00:02:32.468 --> 00:02:36.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than 400 Disaster Relief Committees

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:39.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have already been appointed worldwide.

00:02:39.642 --> 00:02:42.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These committees are working tirelessly

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:45.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to ensure that our brothers and sisters

00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:48.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have what they need to survive.

00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:52.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the case in the country of Angola.

00:02:52.488 --> 00:02:57.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How are the brothers benefiting
from the food relief being provided?

00:02:57.427 --> 00:03:00.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Johannes De Jager
from the Angola branch

00:03:00.763 --> 00:03:02.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has an update for us.

00:03:04.734 --> 00:03:06.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Back in March,
a state of emergency

00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:09.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was declared here in Angola.

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.373 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
With the lockdown,

00:03:10.373 --> 00:03:12.942 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
many of our brothers and sisters
could no longer work,

00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:16.112 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
making it difficult to feed their families.

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:17.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a Branch Committee,

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were extremely concerned
about the situation.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We wondered,

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:27.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How are we going to look
after all our dear brothers and sisters?’

00:03:27.023 --> 00:03:29.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We immediately wrote
the Coordinators’ Committee

00:03:29.225 --> 00:03:31.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and informed them of the situation.

00:03:31.227 --> 00:03:35.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can imagine how we were overjoyed
when they replied,

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:39.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
providing us the aid so that we could feed
our dear brothers.

00:03:39.936 --> 00:03:44.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, suddenly we needed
to coordinate a huge relief effort.

00:03:44.908 --> 00:03:49.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To accomplish the work,
we appointed 37 Disaster Relief Committees.

00:03:49.913 --> 00:03:52.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Locally, we purchased
and distributed

00:03:52.715 --> 00:03:56.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
138 tons of rice,
138 tons of maize meal,

00:03:56.753 --> 00:03:59.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 104 tons of beans.

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:02.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally, through world headquarters,

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:06.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we purchased 313 tons of food from Brazil.

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first shipment arrived July 12th.

00:04:08.865 --> 00:04:12.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers have worked quickly
to distribute the food.

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:17.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thus far,
34,701 brothers and interested ones

00:04:17.607 --> 00:04:21.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have received basic food supplies.

00:04:22.245 --> 00:04:25.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The appreciation for these provisions
has been overwhelming.

00:04:25.581 --> 00:04:28.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
one widowed sister

00:04:28.584 --> 00:04:32.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
raising her five grandchildren received food.

00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:37.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said, “Jehovah sees me.”

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:40.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We realize that this is an ongoing situation,

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we are confident

00:04:42.832 --> 00:04:46.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will continue to lovingly care

00:04:46.269 --> 00:04:49.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all our brothers in Angola.

00:04:51.074 --> 00:04:55.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a clear expression
of Jehovah’s tender care

00:04:55.011 --> 00:04:57.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our brothers in Angola!

00:04:57.547 --> 00:05:02.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course,
the need for relief isn’t limited to Angola.

00:05:02.085 --> 00:05:05.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right now, with Jehovah’s help,

00:05:05.121 --> 00:05:08.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
relief efforts are ongoing throughout Africa,

00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:13.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
South America,
and many other parts of the world.

00:05:13.096 --> 00:05:17.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact,
the Governing Body has thus far approved

00:05:17.467 --> 00:05:22.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over 17 million dollars of relief aid

00:05:22.138 --> 00:05:25.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help our dear brothers
during this pandemic.

00:05:25.942 --> 00:05:28.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, on this topic of food supplies,

00:05:28.978 --> 00:05:31.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’d like to share a reminder:

00:05:31.814 --> 00:05:35.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks occurring

00:05:35.852 --> 00:05:40.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, in some cases,
<i>reoccurring</i>  around the world,

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:45.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we never know when supply lines
will falter in our area

00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:48.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or when we may need to shelter-in-place

00:05:48.664 --> 00:05:51.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for an extended period of time.

00:05:51.567 --> 00:05:56.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, if possible in your local situation,

00:05:56.572 --> 00:06:00.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it would be wise to have on hand a reserve

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:03.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of nonperishable food items

00:06:03.679 --> 00:06:06.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other basic necessities,

00:06:06.549 --> 00:06:11.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not hoarding food
or stockpiling it unnecessarily,

00:06:11.487 --> 00:06:16.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but maintaining a reasonable supply
as a precaution.

00:06:17.393 --> 00:06:21.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, what about our <i>spiritual </i> food?

00:06:21.397 --> 00:06:24.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How is Jehovah caring for that need?

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:28.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of us have been attending
our congregation meetings

00:06:28.738 --> 00:06:30.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by videoconference.

00:06:30.907 --> 00:06:34.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although we miss the personal contact,

00:06:34.243 --> 00:06:38.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
haven’t our online meetings been a blessing?

00:06:38.214 --> 00:06:43.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In many places,
meeting attendance has gone up significantly.

00:06:43.152 --> 00:06:47.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of our dear inactive
brothers and sisters

00:06:47.123 --> 00:06:49.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been attending with us.

00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:52.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been wonderful to have them.

00:06:52.428 --> 00:06:57.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how proud we are
of you elderly brothers and sisters!

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve quickly learned
how to use the videoconferencing tools.

00:07:02.605 --> 00:07:06.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love seeing you
participate at the meetings.

00:07:07.977 --> 00:07:09.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as we know,

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:12.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many of our brothers
and sisters live in areas

00:07:12.982 --> 00:07:16.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Internet access
is either not available

00:07:16.652 --> 00:07:19.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or it’s simply too expensive.

00:07:19.989 --> 00:07:24.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How are our brothers in these areas
getting <i>their</i>  spiritual food?

00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:28.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may recall
from the third Governing Body update

00:07:28.731 --> 00:07:31.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that some branches in Africa were approved

00:07:31.434 --> 00:07:35.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to broadcast the special talk
and the Memorial

00:07:35.605 --> 00:07:39.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over local TV and radio stations.

00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:42.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’m so happy to tell you

00:07:42.011 --> 00:07:45.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Governing Body has also approved

00:07:45.014 --> 00:07:47.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have regular congregation meetings

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:52.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
broadcast via TV and radio!

00:07:52.088 --> 00:07:55.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the branches 
benefiting from this arrangement

00:07:55.525 --> 00:07:57.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is Mozambique.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:01.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Amaro Teixeira will give us an update

00:08:01.464 --> 00:08:03.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the impact that this is having.

00:08:05.334 --> 00:08:07.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Mozambique,

00:08:07.336 --> 00:08:10.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many brothers live in areas where Internet

00:08:10.306 --> 00:08:13.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and electronic devices are not available.

00:08:13.109 --> 00:08:15.945 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So we were so happy when the Governing Body

00:08:15.945 --> 00:08:18.247 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
informed all branches in Africa

00:08:18.247 --> 00:08:19.916 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we could investigate

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:24.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
broadcasting congregation meetings
over TV and radio.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:29.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As of July 10,
arrangements have been made

00:08:29.025 --> 00:08:33.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with 87 radio stations
and one TV outlet in Mozambique.

00:08:33.629 --> 00:08:38.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This allows more than 51,000
of our brothers and sisters

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:43.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to listen to the meetings
each week in 24 different languages.

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:46.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is very good for our brothers.

00:08:46.642 --> 00:08:50.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These spiritual programs
are at the same time available

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to an audience of about 23 million people.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:58.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers are so grateful
for these arrangements.

00:08:58.387 --> 00:09:03.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it was announced,
some cried tears of joy.

00:09:03.226 --> 00:09:07.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many brothers shared the feelings
of one couple who wrote:

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:11.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Your hard work,
together with Jehovah’s holy spirit,

00:09:11.667 --> 00:09:15.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“has moved the ‘mountains’
to give our brothers in Mozambique

00:09:15.504 --> 00:09:18.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“their spiritual ‘food at the proper time.’

00:09:18.474 --> 00:09:22.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah’s active support
and love for all of us

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:26.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“overwhelmed us
with gratitude and love for him,

00:09:26.782 --> 00:09:29.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his Son, and our spiritual family.”

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:33.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How wonderful!

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:37.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This provision was recently extended
to other branches,

00:09:37.927 --> 00:09:40.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now we’re broadcasting
congregation meetings

00:09:40.796 --> 00:09:45.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
via TV and radio in 21 countries.

00:09:45.534 --> 00:09:50.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This allows
about 1.2 million brothers and sisters

00:09:50.039 --> 00:09:53.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to listen to recordings
of congregation meetings

00:09:53.542 --> 00:09:57.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and makes our spiritual programs available

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a potential audience

00:10:00.116 --> 00:10:05.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of almost 280 million people!

00:10:06.222 --> 00:10:09.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is certainly providing his people

00:10:09.425 --> 00:10:13.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with needed physical and spiritual food.

00:10:13.929 --> 00:10:18.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how is he caring
for our persecuted brothers?

00:10:18.934 --> 00:10:21.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During this pandemic,

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:25.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many of us may have felt like prisoners
in our own homes.

00:10:25.975 --> 00:10:28.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But just think for a moment

00:10:28.644 --> 00:10:31.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about those who are actually in prison

00:10:31.614 --> 00:10:35.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—right now—
during this pandemic.

00:10:35.151 --> 00:10:37.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As of July 19, 2020,

00:10:37.586 --> 00:10:42.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at least 116 brothers and sisters worldwide

00:10:42.591 --> 00:10:45.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are imprisoned for their faith.

00:10:45.361 --> 00:10:47.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Russia,

00:10:47.363 --> 00:10:51.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an additional 27 
are presently under house arrest,

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:56.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 372 are under criminal investigation.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Worldwide,
the youngest ones in prison

00:11:01.177 --> 00:11:03.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are just 19 years old,

00:11:03.546 --> 00:11:07.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the oldest is 81.

00:11:07.516 --> 00:11:10.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of our brothers have been imprisoned

00:11:10.186 --> 00:11:12.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or under house arrest for years.

00:11:12.888 --> 00:11:16.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take, for example,
our three brothers in Eritrea

00:11:16.058 --> 00:11:19.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Paulos, Isaac, and Negede—

00:11:19.462 --> 00:11:21.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who’ve been in prison the longest

00:11:21.731 --> 00:11:25.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—almost 26 years!

00:11:26.435 --> 00:11:31.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Russia, just last week,
on July 13, 2020,

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was a record number
of searches of our brothers’ homes

00:11:35.978 --> 00:11:39.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—at least 100 in one day.

00:11:39.648 --> 00:11:42.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In connection with this raid,

00:11:42.318 --> 00:11:46.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers Dmitrii Katyrov and Aleksandr Bokov

00:11:46.489 --> 00:11:49.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were beaten by the authorities.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:55.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Counting from the time
when the ban started in 2017,

00:11:55.131 --> 00:11:58.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this brings the total number of home raids

00:11:58.567 --> 00:12:01.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to over 1,000!

00:12:01.704 --> 00:12:04.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers in prison around the world

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:08.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
needed our prayers before COVID-19,

00:12:08.444 --> 00:12:12.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they need them even more now.

00:12:12.615 --> 00:12:16.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Hebrews 13:3, Paul wrote:

00:12:16.852 --> 00:12:19.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep in mind those in prison,

00:12:19.922 --> 00:12:24.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as though you were imprisoned with them.”

00:12:24.193 --> 00:12:27.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Certainly, we feel
for our brothers and sisters

00:12:27.863 --> 00:12:30.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are imprisoned for their faith.

00:12:30.599 --> 00:12:32.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How are they bearing up?

00:12:32.768 --> 00:12:36.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How is Jehovah sustaining them
through their trials?

00:12:36.939 --> 00:12:39.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s get an update from two sisters

00:12:39.742 --> 00:12:42.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were held in detention in Russia.

00:12:47.583 --> 00:12:50.786 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
On June 11, 2019,

00:12:50.786 --> 00:12:52.455 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
at around eight o’clock in the morning,

00:12:52.455 --> 00:12:55.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
officers from the investigative committee

00:12:55.658 --> 00:12:58.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the police burst into our home.

00:12:58.127 --> 00:13:00.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The search lasted almost all day.

00:13:00.129 --> 00:13:04.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then after the search,
they took us to the investigative committee,

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.868 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
where they detained us

00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:07.536 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and put us in a temporary holding facility.

00:13:09.472 --> 00:13:12.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The result was a court hearing in Novozybkov.

00:13:12.107 --> 00:13:15.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They imposed restrictive measures on me,
meaning they put me in detention.

00:13:15.544 --> 00:13:20.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, altogether,
I spent almost eight months behind bars.

00:13:21.083 --> 00:13:23.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I spent eight months
in a pretrial detention facility.

00:13:23.652 --> 00:13:26.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I spent 245 days behind bars.

00:13:30.926 --> 00:13:33.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For me, the time I spent
in pretrial detention

00:13:33.963 --> 00:13:36.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
went by very quickly.

00:13:36.098 --> 00:13:39.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even that number
—245 days—

00:13:39.335 --> 00:13:41.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it sounds like a lot

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, really,
it didn’t feel like that many

00:13:44.473 --> 00:13:48.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I was busy replying to letters

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:51.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also talking to my cellmates.

00:13:51.113 --> 00:13:54.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah a lot during that time.

00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:58.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read the Bible, and I did personal study.

00:13:59.688 --> 00:14:02.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eight months in pretrial detention—

00:14:02.291 --> 00:14:04.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could really describe it
as being in isolation,

00:14:04.994 --> 00:14:07.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I missed live association

00:14:07.897 --> 00:14:10.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—live association with brothers and sisters

00:14:10.633 --> 00:14:12.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you can talk to them in real life,

00:14:12.801 --> 00:14:15.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
face-to-face,
and even hug them.

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:17.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the beginning, it was hard.

00:14:17.673 --> 00:14:22.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then I saw that if you
accept the circumstances,

00:14:22.111 --> 00:14:25.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it becomes easier to get on with life.

00:14:25.414 --> 00:14:29.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah
not to feel sorry for myself

00:14:29.218 --> 00:14:32.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not to concentrate
on how bad things were

00:14:32.788 --> 00:14:35.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being in one room all the time.

00:14:36.392 --> 00:14:38.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to accept the conditions

00:14:38.694 --> 00:14:41.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found myself in on any given day.

00:14:41.864 --> 00:14:43.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also realized

00:14:43.999 --> 00:14:47.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it is important to always look
for reasons to be grateful,

00:14:47.903 --> 00:14:50.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and every evening, even if it didn’t seem

00:14:50.773 --> 00:14:53.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as though anything particularly special
had happened,

00:14:53.909 --> 00:14:57.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to thank Jehovah,
and that also gave me strength,

00:14:57.846 --> 00:15:01.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it turns out that in every day,
there is something good.

00:15:01.584 --> 00:15:04.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It got to the point where sometimes

00:15:04.186 --> 00:15:06.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t even notice the locked door!

00:15:06.855 --> 00:15:10.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through the bars,
I saw the sky and didn’t even see the bars.

00:15:10.926 --> 00:15:13.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or when we went out for exercise,

00:15:13.596 --> 00:15:17.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which was just a yard with walls all around

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just a bit of the sky was visible,

00:15:20.703 --> 00:15:24.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that Jehovah
gives the right attitude when,

00:15:24.239 --> 00:15:27.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for example,
I wondered, ‘What is behind those walls?’

00:15:28.377 --> 00:15:31.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I could even imagine
that the Alps were out there,

00:15:31.847 --> 00:15:36.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there were cornflowers
(my favorite flowers) out there and poppies.

00:15:36.585 --> 00:15:38.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thanked Jehovah that I had,

00:15:38.587 --> 00:15:41.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for example,
the Bible and that I could read it

00:15:41.657 --> 00:15:44.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for being able to pray to Jehovah,

00:15:44.026 --> 00:15:48.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the fact that I had been able to do
the right thing that day,

00:15:48.063 --> 00:15:50.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the bird that I had seen from the window.

00:15:50.799 --> 00:15:53.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And before the detention, I imagined

00:15:53.068 --> 00:15:55.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if it did happen,

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:57.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is an assignment from Jehovah
for the time being.

00:15:58.374 --> 00:16:03.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first day I received letters
was the anniversary of my baptism.

00:16:03.145 --> 00:16:06.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Twenty-four years had passed
since that occasion.

00:16:06.815 --> 00:16:09.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was feeling somewhat downcast,

00:16:09.351 --> 00:16:12.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I asked Jehovah for a special gift.

00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:15.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at the end of the day,
I received that special gift

00:16:16.792 --> 00:16:20.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it was 59 letters from brothers and sisters!

00:16:20.396 --> 00:16:23.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I realized
just what a unique God Jehovah is,

00:16:23.966 --> 00:16:26.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he tenderly cares for his servants.

00:16:26.902 --> 00:16:30.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It convinced me once again
that Jehovah is a caring Father.

00:16:30.806 --> 00:16:32.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first time I received

00:16:32.808 --> 00:16:35.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such a large number of letters
—54 of them—

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:38.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I sat on the bed, put them on my lap,

00:16:38.113 --> 00:16:40.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and didn’t know what to do with them.

00:16:40.549 --> 00:16:42.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I gathered my thoughts.

00:16:42.618 --> 00:16:45.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, there were tears in my eyes!

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:48.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I gathered my thoughts
and started going through them.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to the letters,

00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:53.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was also able to do personal study.

00:16:53.495 --> 00:16:58.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wrote down in two exercise books
the thoughts that really strengthened me.

00:16:58.934 --> 00:17:03.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In one letter, it talked
about the secret of David’s courage.

00:17:03.572 --> 00:17:06.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it said that he concentrated,

00:17:06.141 --> 00:17:10.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not on how big Goliath was
in comparison to him,

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:13.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but on how tiny that giant was
in comparison to Jehovah.

00:17:14.483 --> 00:17:17.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That thought really helped me

00:17:17.186 --> 00:17:20.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to switch to the right frame of mind
and see Jehovah.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when they escorted me
from the courtroom to the vehicle,

00:17:28.731 --> 00:17:30.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the transport vehicle,

00:17:30.733 --> 00:17:34.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers and sisters who were still there

00:17:34.002 --> 00:17:36.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shouted words of encouragement.

00:17:38.874 --> 00:17:41.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, I didn’t expect to see them there,

00:17:41.477 --> 00:17:45.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I didn’t know
how they would escort us from the courtroom.

00:17:45.247 --> 00:17:47.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although you could say I was rather sad

00:17:47.983 --> 00:17:50.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they left in place
the restrictive measures,

00:17:50.385 --> 00:17:52.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I got into the vehicle,

00:17:52.955 --> 00:17:55.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was overjoyed inside

00:17:55.023 --> 00:17:57.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because,
although I could hardly see the brothers,

00:17:57.226 --> 00:17:59.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could hear their voices.

00:18:04.933 --> 00:18:09.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It made me determined
to remain faithful to Jehovah,

00:18:09.037 --> 00:18:13.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it helped me to stand up for the truth
in the court hearings,

00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:17.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I felt that I was not alone

00:18:17.112 --> 00:18:22.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I knew that many
are concerned for me and praying for me.

00:18:22.084 --> 00:18:24.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was in hard circumstances,

00:18:24.853 --> 00:18:27.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I actually became convinced that no matter

00:18:27.923 --> 00:18:30.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how serious the difficulties are,

00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:33.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah always gives enough holy spirit

00:18:33.028 --> 00:18:35.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to overcome any trial.

00:18:35.898 --> 00:18:37.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that actually

00:18:37.966 --> 00:18:41.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is no need to be afraid
of trials that may befall us.

00:18:41.436 --> 00:18:44.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is always close to us,

00:18:44.606 --> 00:18:47.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he always supports, strengthens,

00:18:47.543 --> 00:18:49.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helps us.

00:18:49.578 --> 00:18:52.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is very sensitive to our needs

00:18:52.014 --> 00:18:54.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, at times like that,

00:18:54.016 --> 00:18:57.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he draws close to us in a unique way.

00:19:04.026 --> 00:19:06.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How encouraging!

00:19:06.028 --> 00:19:09.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prison walls cannot stop Jehovah

00:19:09.264 --> 00:19:12.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from tenderly caring for his servants.

00:19:12.201 --> 00:19:15.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think these upbuilding expressions
of our sisters

00:19:15.971 --> 00:19:19.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help many of us
who are feeling isolated

00:19:19.675 --> 00:19:21.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the pandemic.

00:19:22.611 --> 00:19:24.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters,

00:19:24.613 --> 00:19:28.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re all going through a difficult time.

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:31.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of you have lost your jobs,

00:19:31.119 --> 00:19:34.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some are concerned
about finding enough food for each day,

00:19:34.857 --> 00:19:39.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many of us have lost loved ones in death.

00:19:40.128 --> 00:19:43.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In spite of all these challenges,

00:19:43.165 --> 00:19:48.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
isn’t it clear that Jehovah
is helping us to cope

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:51.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—both physically and spiritually?

00:19:51.907 --> 00:19:54.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As our Shepherd,

00:19:54.109 --> 00:19:57.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he is carrying us along

00:19:57.112 --> 00:19:59.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his loving arms.

00:19:59.915 --> 00:20:02.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether we’re in lockdown,

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:06.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
facing food shortages, or even in prison,

00:20:06.121 --> 00:20:10.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his tender care will keep us going

00:20:10.158 --> 00:20:14.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it will get us through to the end.

00:20:14.563 --> 00:20:19.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can be confident
that with Jehovah’s help and guidance,

00:20:19.568 --> 00:20:23.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will continue to organize relief efforts

00:20:23.071 --> 00:20:25.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wherever they are needed.

00:20:25.941 --> 00:20:27.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But remember,

00:20:27.943 --> 00:20:30.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah may also use <i>you </i>

00:20:30.712 --> 00:20:33.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to come to the aid of others.

00:20:33.649 --> 00:20:37.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray for his spirit to guide you.

00:20:37.119 --> 00:20:40.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you see an opportunity to help,

00:20:40.422 --> 00:20:42.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take action!

00:20:42.624 --> 00:20:46.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 13:16 says:

00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:49.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not forget to do good

00:20:49.498 --> 00:20:53.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and to share what you have with others,

00:20:53.068 --> 00:20:58.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for God is well-pleased
with such sacrifices.”

00:20:58.607 --> 00:21:03.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a privilege we have
to be used by Jehovah

00:21:03.078 --> 00:21:06.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to provide tender care for one another!

00:21:06.782 --> 00:21:09.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On behalf of the Governing Body,
