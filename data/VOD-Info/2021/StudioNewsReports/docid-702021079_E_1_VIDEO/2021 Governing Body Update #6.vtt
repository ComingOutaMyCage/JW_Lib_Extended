Were you hoping this pandemic

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.522 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
would be over by now?

00:00:05.522 --> 00:00:07.524 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I think we all were!

00:00:07.524 --> 00:00:08.858 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In some places,

00:00:08.858 --> 00:00:11.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the number of new cases is low.

00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:15.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in other parts of the world,
highly contagious variants

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are spreading and the pandemic

00:00:18.234 --> 00:00:21.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is raging like never before.

00:00:21.237 --> 00:00:24.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a sobering reminder

00:00:24.174 --> 00:00:28.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this pandemic is <i>not</i>  over.

00:00:28.044 --> 00:00:30.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We “weep with those who weep,”

00:00:30.914 --> 00:00:35.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we pray especially
for our brothers and sisters

00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:37.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Latin America and Africa,

00:00:37.487 --> 00:00:40.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where there’s been quite an increase

00:00:40.423 --> 00:00:42.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of cases in recent weeks.

00:00:42.992 --> 00:00:45.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other parts of the world,

00:00:45.395 --> 00:00:49.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
vaccinations have slowed
the spread of the virus.

00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:52.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re doing what we can to help Bethelites

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:54.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other special full-time servants

00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:58.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
get vaccinated if they want to be.

00:00:58.608 --> 00:01:01.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re happy to report that about 50 percent

00:01:01.544 --> 00:01:04.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the worldwide Bethel family

00:01:04.447 --> 00:01:07.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been vaccinated so far.

00:01:07.083 --> 00:01:10.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here in the United States,
more than 98 percent

00:01:10.787 --> 00:01:14.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our Bethel family
have chosen to get vaccinated.

00:01:14.524 --> 00:01:17.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
New York State regulations

00:01:17.193 --> 00:01:20.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now allow vaccinated persons

00:01:20.196 --> 00:01:23.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to engage in a greater number of activities.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In harmony with those government regulations,

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve been able
to resume some of our activities

00:01:30.473 --> 00:01:32.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
within Bethel.

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The family was delighted

00:01:35.812 --> 00:01:39.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that government regulations
allowed those who are vaccinated

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:41.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to assemble.

00:01:41.785 --> 00:01:46.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means we could come together
for meals in our dining rooms

00:01:46.122 --> 00:01:49.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for our Bethel family <i>Watchtower</i>  Study. 

00:01:49.993 --> 00:01:52.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re all glad
to be back together here again.

00:01:52.662 --> 00:01:54.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a happy day that was

00:01:54.764 --> 00:01:57.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to assemble again for the <i>Watchtower</i>  Study!

00:01:57.834 --> 00:02:00.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, the decision

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:02.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be vaccinated is a personal one.

00:02:02.972 --> 00:02:05.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What factors might a Christian consider

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:08.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in making the decision?

00:02:08.111 --> 00:02:10.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number one:

00:02:10.346 --> 00:02:13.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Jehovah’s Witnesses, we do not have

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a religious objection to vaccination.

00:02:17.187 --> 00:02:19.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number two:

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are in the midst of a pandemic.

00:02:21.825 --> 00:02:25.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As of July 9, over 19,000

00:02:25.428 --> 00:02:29.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our dear brothers and sisters
have died from the virus.

00:02:29.933 --> 00:02:32.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number three:

00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:35.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some lands, “the superior authorities”

00:02:35.505 --> 00:02:38.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have made laws requiring
all of their citizens

00:02:38.808 --> 00:02:40.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be vaccinated.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other lands, the superior authorities
have not made laws,

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:47.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they are strongly encouraging

00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:51.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their citizens to be vaccinated.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We each must weigh such factors

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when making our own personal decision.

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:02.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Continue to take reasonable precautions

00:03:02.298 --> 00:03:04.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in accord with local conditions,

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially if you have health problems
or you’re up in years.

00:03:09.405 --> 00:03:14.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay in touch with direction
coming from the local health authorities,

00:03:14.077 --> 00:03:16.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be careful.

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:20.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this update, I’d like to talk
with all of you older ones.

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:22.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m an older person myself.

00:03:22.986 --> 00:03:26.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m going to turn 87 before too long.

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 20 or 30 years old,

00:03:29.425 --> 00:03:31.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had no idea

00:03:31.427 --> 00:03:34.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d still be around at 87.

00:03:34.998 --> 00:03:37.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of you probably feel the same way.

00:03:37.533 --> 00:03:39.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But here we are now,

00:03:39.602 --> 00:03:43.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just like Ecclesiastes chapter 12 says,

00:03:43.273 --> 00:03:46.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the days of distress” have come.

00:03:46.843 --> 00:03:49.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our bodies are slowing down.

00:03:49.412 --> 00:03:52.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve lost the youth we used to have.

00:03:52.548 --> 00:03:56.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can’t see or hear too well.

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve got all kinds of health problems.

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:03.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And during the pandemic,
we’ve had to stay shut up in our

00:04:03.927 --> 00:04:08.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
little old homes for a lot longer
than we thought we would.

00:04:08.898 --> 00:04:11.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it may be

00:04:11.034 --> 00:04:13.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that one or two of us have felt

00:04:13.736 --> 00:04:17.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God has just thrown us away,

00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:19.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he’s just not interested

00:04:19.475 --> 00:04:22.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in old people after our youth is gone.

00:04:24.447 --> 00:04:27.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know he’s going to take care of us

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we’re going to get everlasting life—

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:31.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but right now

00:04:31.654 --> 00:04:36.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we feel like we’re kind of on our own.

00:04:36.626 --> 00:04:40.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I’d like to remind you
of something found in the Bible.

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:44.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, at one time, most likely David

00:04:44.968 --> 00:04:47.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thought that Jehovah had left him.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the reason why he said

00:04:50.173 --> 00:04:54.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what is recorded at Psalm 71:9:

00:04:54.677 --> 00:04:58.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not cast me off in my old age;

00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:01.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not abandon me when my strength fails.”

00:05:01.918 --> 00:05:04.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we know that Jesus

00:05:04.487 --> 00:05:07.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mentioned David in His teaching,

00:05:07.156 --> 00:05:10.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because hundreds of years later,
after David’s death,

00:05:10.994 --> 00:05:13.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Christ talked about David.

00:05:13.496 --> 00:05:18.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah didn’t throw him away
—that’s for sure!

00:05:18.434 --> 00:05:20.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And He’s going to remember David

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:23.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even more in the resurrection.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And He hasn’t really
thrown any of us away either

00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:32.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even though we may feel
that he has at times.

00:05:32.382 --> 00:05:34.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you know that?

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:37.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you personally know

00:05:37.086 --> 00:05:40.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has not thrown you away?

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:43.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s think about it.

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How many of you

00:05:45.294 --> 00:05:48.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
know how old Methuselah was when he died?

00:05:48.965 --> 00:05:52.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You probably learned that a long time ago.

00:05:52.368 --> 00:05:54.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know the answer.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was really old

00:05:56.839 --> 00:06:00.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the oldest one mentioned
among imperfect humans in the Bible.

00:06:00.843 --> 00:06:05.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How many of you know how old Noah was

00:06:05.214 --> 00:06:07.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he started to build the ark?

00:06:07.683 --> 00:06:12.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was well over 500 years old!

00:06:12.388 --> 00:06:14.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That shows us

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God remembers us when we’re old.

00:06:18.895 --> 00:06:23.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Christian Greek Scriptures also tell us
about the prophetess Anna,

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:26.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was 84 years old.

00:06:26.736 --> 00:06:29.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we know she was 84 years old?

00:06:29.872 --> 00:06:32.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s in the inspired Scriptures.

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:36.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Jehovah didn’t want us to know her age,

00:06:36.145 --> 00:06:39.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he wouldn’t have put it in there, would he?

00:06:39.048 --> 00:06:42.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, doesn’t that tell us something?

00:06:42.452 --> 00:06:46.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah keeps track of age,

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:50.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s interested in us older ones.

00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:52.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 90 comes right out and says

00:06:52.995 --> 00:06:56.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that imperfect men live to be

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:59.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe 70 or 80 years old,

00:06:59.202 --> 00:07:03.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even then, those years
“are filled with trouble.”

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:08.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah put all that in there
for us to know

00:07:08.411 --> 00:07:12.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he has not thrown us away

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:15.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that he remembers us.

00:07:16.986 --> 00:07:19.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are so proud of you.

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:22.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of you have learned to use <i>Zoom</i>

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:25.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to mute and unmute yourself.

00:07:25.495 --> 00:07:28.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m still learning to use <i>Zoom.</i>

00:07:28.464 --> 00:07:31.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve tackled telephone witnessing
and letter writing.

00:07:31.767 --> 00:07:35.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s amazing to see how fast you did it!

00:07:35.271 --> 00:07:39.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, Jehovah has been with you
and has strengthened you.

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:41.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what he promises

00:07:41.978 --> 00:07:46.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Psalm 29:11:

00:07:46.182 --> 00:07:49.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah will give strength to his people.

00:07:49.485 --> 00:07:52.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will bless his people with peace.”

00:07:52.455 --> 00:07:55.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through this whole pandemic,

00:07:55.625 --> 00:07:58.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve seen evidence that Jehovah

00:07:58.127 --> 00:08:02.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has continued to give us strength
and to bless us with peace.

00:08:02.598 --> 00:08:07.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why nothing has stopped
the Kingdom work from moving forward.

00:08:07.537 --> 00:08:11.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A good example of that
is our theocratic construction.

00:08:12.708 --> 00:08:16.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may be wondering
how the pandemic has affected

00:08:16.812 --> 00:08:19.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the worldwide construction work,

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:22.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to mention all the work normally done

00:08:22.718 --> 00:08:25.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to maintain our Kingdom Halls.

00:08:25.087 --> 00:08:27.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did everything just stop?

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:32.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when the pandemic first hit,

00:08:32.161 --> 00:08:35.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we did suspend most 

00:08:35.331 --> 00:08:39.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
new construction and renovations
so that the construction servants

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:42.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and volunteers could shelter in place.

00:08:42.538 --> 00:08:46.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our first concern was the safety

00:08:46.108 --> 00:08:48.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the thousands
of volunteers working full-time

00:08:48.878 --> 00:08:51.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Local Design/Construction.

00:08:51.847 --> 00:08:55.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, many of those brothers and sisters

00:08:55.918 --> 00:08:59.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
serve far from their families and friends,

00:08:59.989 --> 00:09:03.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so sheltering in place hasn’t been easy.

00:09:03.659 --> 00:09:05.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What has helped them to cope

00:09:05.895 --> 00:09:09.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the loneliness and isolation?

00:09:10.566 --> 00:09:13.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen to their comments
in the following video.

00:09:15.137 --> 00:09:17.139 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The brothers organized

00:09:17.139 --> 00:09:18.674 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
frequent shepherding visits

00:09:18.674 --> 00:09:20.176 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by videoconference.

00:09:20.176 --> 00:09:21.611 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
During these visits,

00:09:21.611 --> 00:09:24.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they asked me how I was doing physically,

00:09:24.447 --> 00:09:27.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
emotionally, and spiritually.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:30.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I appreciate so very much

00:09:30.453 --> 00:09:32.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they were thinking about me,

00:09:32.688 --> 00:09:36.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they chose specific Bible texts
to share with me.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.528 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So during the pandemic,

00:09:39.528 --> 00:09:41.564 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was assigned a field service group

00:09:41.564 --> 00:09:42.898 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to oversee,

00:09:42.898 --> 00:09:45.301 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and this gave me more opportunities 

00:09:45.301 --> 00:09:47.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to assist new publishers

00:09:47.536 --> 00:09:51.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in maintaining
good personal Bible study habits

00:09:51.307 --> 00:09:55.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also train brothers to reach out
for more responsibilities.

00:09:55.077 --> 00:09:58.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I’m not able to visit my family in Europe,

00:09:58.447 --> 00:10:02.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I often call them, and I share
encouraging thoughts with them.

00:10:02.318 --> 00:10:05.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also like helping young ones
in the ministry.

00:10:05.655 --> 00:10:08.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is not easy for them to preach
during this pandemic,

00:10:08.924 --> 00:10:12.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but preaching together boosts all of us.

00:10:12.295 --> 00:10:15.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And by giving, I felt Jehovah’s blessings.

00:10:15.798 --> 00:10:18.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, brothers and sisters

00:10:18.134 --> 00:10:20.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been checking up on my husband and me

00:10:20.569 --> 00:10:23.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have been an emotional support
during this lockdown.

00:10:23.673 --> 00:10:26.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without them knowing, their texts, calls,

00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:29.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other caring deeds
have made things easier for us.

00:10:31.914 --> 00:10:36.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice what helped them
maintain a positive outlook?

00:10:36.452 --> 00:10:39.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Encouraging shepherding visits

00:10:39.188 --> 00:10:43.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and staying busy with spiritual activities.

00:10:43.192 --> 00:10:46.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So even though they couldn’t work as much

00:10:46.095 --> 00:10:49.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on branch projects or build Kingdom Halls,

00:10:49.598 --> 00:10:52.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they could build up their spirituality

00:10:52.935 --> 00:10:54.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and encourage others

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:58.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and that’s exactly what they did.

00:10:58.341 --> 00:11:01.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we said earlier

00:11:01.177 --> 00:11:04.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that most construction had to stop

00:11:04.613 --> 00:11:07.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a while because of the virus.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:11.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did that mean <i>everything</i>  stopped?

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not at all!

00:11:13.155 --> 00:11:15.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were able to keep making progress

00:11:15.891 --> 00:11:18.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a number of branch projects.

00:11:18.427 --> 00:11:22.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One example is
the new branch property in Argentina.

00:11:23.966 --> 00:11:27.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The project faced many delays
because of the pandemic,

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:32.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but with Jehovah’s help,
our brothers were able to work through them

00:11:32.575 --> 00:11:36.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the assistance of contractors.

00:11:36.412 --> 00:11:39.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now the Bethel family
has started to move in,

00:11:39.982 --> 00:11:44.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taking strict precautions against COVID-19.

00:11:44.487 --> 00:11:46.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ll finish moving

00:11:46.589 --> 00:11:49.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into the new facility in the weeks to come.

00:11:50.926 --> 00:11:53.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how have our other

00:11:53.662 --> 00:11:57.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
design and construction teams
kept the work moving?

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s hear from a few of them.

00:12:02.705 --> 00:12:04.907 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The Worldwide Design/Construction

00:12:04.907 --> 00:12:06.108 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Training Desk

00:12:06.108 --> 00:12:07.510 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
recognized the opportunity

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:08.878 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to sharpen the awareness

00:12:08.878 --> 00:12:11.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of safety among all who participate

00:12:11.514 --> 00:12:14.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in theocratic construction
and maintenance projects.

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:18.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So because of this,
a safety training course for overseers 

00:12:18.387 --> 00:12:19.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was rolled out globally.

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:22.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About 7,500

00:12:22.491 --> 00:12:25.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
responsible brothers benefited from this

00:12:25.261 --> 00:12:28.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
via videoconference.

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:30.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A brother from Belgium said,

00:12:30.266 --> 00:12:32.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I now recognize that safety

00:12:32.902 --> 00:12:35.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is an extension of my spirituality.”

00:12:35.004 --> 00:12:37.206 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Here in Africa,

00:12:37.206 --> 00:12:39.141 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the pandemic has emphasized

00:12:39.141 --> 00:12:41.877 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the need to better prepare our Kingdom Halls

00:12:41.877 --> 00:12:45.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for health and hygiene
for our brothers and sisters.

00:12:45.147 --> 00:12:48.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Solutions such as handwashing stations,

00:12:48.317 --> 00:12:50.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
limiting physical touch points,

00:12:50.786 --> 00:12:54.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other hygiene-related needs
are being addressed.

00:12:55.458 --> 00:12:58.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Local Design/Construction departments

00:12:58.294 --> 00:13:02.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are also busy planning for future projects

00:13:02.665 --> 00:13:05.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and doing essential Kingdom Hall maintenance

00:13:05.734 --> 00:13:07.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and repairs.

00:13:07.903 --> 00:13:11.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in areas where conditions
have allowed it,

00:13:11.474 --> 00:13:15.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some branches have even been able
to start new projects

00:13:15.644 --> 00:13:19.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a limited number
of construction servants.

00:13:19.281 --> 00:13:24.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our thanks go out to all
of you construction volunteers

00:13:24.286 --> 00:13:26.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who keep giving generously

00:13:26.856 --> 00:13:29.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of yourselves as you work hard

00:13:29.625 --> 00:13:33.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on projects and care
for your local Kingdom Halls.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:38.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what does all of this show us?

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:41.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s chariot has not stopped.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:45.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all of us
—old and young—

00:13:45.708 --> 00:13:48.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
want to keep pace with it.

00:13:48.277 --> 00:13:50.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we face the days ahead,

00:13:50.746 --> 00:13:54.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll continue to take a cautious approach

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:56.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that shows respect for life

00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:59.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and keeps the Kingdom work going.

00:14:01.257 --> 00:14:05.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t know exactly
when this pandemic will end,

00:14:05.294 --> 00:14:07.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we know this:

00:14:07.863 --> 00:14:11.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will continue

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:15.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to provide the guidance we need
to get through it.

00:14:17.306 --> 00:14:20.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want you to know that we love you

00:14:20.342 --> 00:14:22.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pray for Jehovah’s blessing

00:14:22.945 --> 00:14:27.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on all you do to serve him faithfully.
