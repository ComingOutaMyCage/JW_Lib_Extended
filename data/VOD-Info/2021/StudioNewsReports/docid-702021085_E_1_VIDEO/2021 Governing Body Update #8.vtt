Dear brothers, sisters,

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.391 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
faithful children, and interested ones,

00:00:08.391 --> 00:00:13.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is a great pleasure 
to be with you for this update.

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:15.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have many good things to share with you,

00:00:15.865 --> 00:00:18.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including an update

00:00:18.034 --> 00:00:22.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on our response 
to several major natural disasters.

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at the end of this update,

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:28.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will be a privilege to share with you

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:33.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our reassuring yeartext for 2022.

00:00:34.751 --> 00:00:36.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To begin, though,

00:00:36.753 --> 00:00:38.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have some important facts

00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:43.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about COVID-19 vaccines to share with you.

00:00:43.927 --> 00:00:47.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because we love you all very much

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and because this is a life-and-death matter,

00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:55.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have decided to share
what we know about this with you.

00:00:56.139 --> 00:01:00.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since June 1 in the United States,

00:01:00.076 --> 00:01:03.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
1,407 publishers

00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:06.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been hospitalized

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of COVID-19 or its symptoms.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of these, less than 1 percent
were fully vaccinated.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, in that same time period
in the United States,

00:01:21.698 --> 00:01:25.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
486 of our brothers

00:01:25.668 --> 00:01:29.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
died from COVID-19.

00:01:29.873 --> 00:01:33.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of these, less than 1 percent

00:01:33.843 --> 00:01:35.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were fully vaccinated.

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:37.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our understanding is

00:01:37.947 --> 00:01:41.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the vaccinated individuals who died

00:01:41.151 --> 00:01:44.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had serious underlying health problems.

00:01:45.722 --> 00:01:49.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These statistics are very sobering.

00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:53.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can also tell you

00:01:53.062 --> 00:01:56.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that of more than 22,000 Bethelites

00:01:56.933 --> 00:02:00.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 44,000 special full-time servants
in the field

00:02:00.804 --> 00:02:02.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have been vaccinated,

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have received only four reports

00:02:07.243 --> 00:02:10.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of severe adverse reactions

00:02:10.013 --> 00:02:13.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that may be linked to the vaccination.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But thankfully it’s been reported

00:02:16.853 --> 00:02:19.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that all of these are stable,

00:02:19.823 --> 00:02:22.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their condition is under control.

00:02:23.626 --> 00:02:26.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We share this information with you

00:02:26.462 --> 00:02:29.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so you can carefully consider it

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:33.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when making your personal decision
regarding vaccination.

00:02:34.637 --> 00:02:37.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We feel it would not be loving

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:42.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to withhold these facts from you.

00:02:42.545 --> 00:02:45.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Proverbs 3:27 says:

00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:48.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not withhold good

00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:53.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from those to whom you should give it.”

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:58.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know it can be difficult
to make a wise decision

00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:03.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when there are various opinions
and conflicting reports

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:05.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the world provides,

00:03:05.702 --> 00:03:10.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps making it hard
to know what to believe.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the aforementioned statistics

00:03:13.643 --> 00:03:17.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been collected by our brothers,

00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:21.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we can trust these figures.

00:03:21.184 --> 00:03:25.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hope they will be useful to you.

00:03:25.154 --> 00:03:29.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We appreciate that this
is not a scientific study,

00:03:29.325 --> 00:03:34.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we can tell you 
what our brothers have observed.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because we have this information,

00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:41.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want you to know what we know.

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:45.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we also need to consider

00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:49.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the direction provided 
by the superior authorities.

00:03:49.078 --> 00:03:51.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some lands,

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
governments are enacting laws 
that all of their citizens

00:03:55.718 --> 00:03:58.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must be vaccinated.

00:03:58.154 --> 00:04:02.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other lands, 
it is strongly encouraged.

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:05.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we react to such direction?

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:08.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The <i>Remain in God’s Love</i>  book

00:04:08.631 --> 00:04:12.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made a fine point when it said this:

00:04:12.936 --> 00:04:17.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Today, Jehovah allows governments

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to have some authority,

00:04:19.475 --> 00:04:21.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and we should respect them.

00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:24.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They organize countries and communities

00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:27.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that they function smoothly

00:04:27.116 --> 00:04:30.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and provide people with necessary services.

00:04:30.787 --> 00:04:33.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Christians obey the instruction found

00:04:33.957 --> 00:04:37.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“at Romans 13:1-7.

00:04:37.293 --> 00:04:40.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We respect ‘the superior authorities’

00:04:40.797 --> 00:04:43.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and obey the laws of the country

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:46.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or community where we live.

00:04:46.002 --> 00:04:48.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“These laws may affect our family,

00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:52.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
business, or possessions.”

00:04:52.008 --> 00:04:54.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, the study note

00:04:54.944 --> 00:04:58.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Romans 13:5 says this:

00:04:58.314 --> 00:05:01.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A Christian submits to human governments

00:05:01.985 --> 00:05:06.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when a command
does not contradict God’s laws.”

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is another serious factor

00:05:10.293 --> 00:05:13.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we each should carefully 
and prayerfully consider

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in making our decision.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result of having over 99 percent

00:05:20.436 --> 00:05:24.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the United States Bethel family 
fully vaccinated,

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have been able to open
up more activities within Bethel

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:32.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in accord with New York State regulations.

00:05:32.682 --> 00:05:35.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This allowed the Bethel family

00:05:35.118 --> 00:05:37.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have the Gilead meal together

00:05:37.887 --> 00:05:41.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then the Gilead graduation
on September 11.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No guests from outside Bethel
were present for either occasion.

00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:57.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, fully vaccinated Bethel family members
in the United States

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have received permission
to take personal time

00:06:01.411 --> 00:06:04.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to visit family and friends,

00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:09.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taking proper COVID-19 precautions
while away from Bethel.

00:06:10.486 --> 00:06:14.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, as of September 24,

00:06:14.157 --> 00:06:18.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over 3,975

00:06:18.027 --> 00:06:20.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fully vaccinated Bethel family members

00:06:20.596 --> 00:06:23.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the United States have traveled

00:06:23.733 --> 00:06:27.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during August and September.

00:06:27.003 --> 00:06:29.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Upon their return to Bethel,

00:06:29.605 --> 00:06:33.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they are put on a form of adjusted quarantine

00:06:33.276 --> 00:06:38.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a few days later are tested for COVID-19.

00:06:38.214 --> 00:06:41.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of these 3,975,

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:45.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have had just four COVID cases.

00:06:45.955 --> 00:06:50.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two got mild cases of COVID
at their destination,

00:06:50.693 --> 00:06:54.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it resolved
before they returned to Bethel.

00:06:54.931 --> 00:06:59.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The other two who tested positive on return

00:06:59.368 --> 00:07:04.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also had minor symptoms
that quickly resolved.

00:07:05.074 --> 00:07:08.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All four have fully recovered.

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:12.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re happy to report

00:07:12.281 --> 00:07:16.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this arrangement
will soon go into effect for our Bethelites

00:07:16.052 --> 00:07:19.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at most branches around the world.

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:23.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are able to do this
at branches where more than 90 percent

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:26.295 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the Bethel family are fully vaccinated.

00:07:28.598 --> 00:07:30.766 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Those branches are getting back into

00:07:30.766 --> 00:07:34.270 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a more normal routine.

00:07:41.844 --> 00:07:44.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we have a brief update

00:07:44.814 --> 00:07:46.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how our brothers are doing

00:07:46.816 --> 00:07:50.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after recent natural disasters in Haiti

00:07:50.753 --> 00:07:53.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in the United States.

00:07:53.289 --> 00:07:56.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As reported in JW News,

00:07:56.592 --> 00:07:59.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a magnitude 7.2 earthquake

00:07:59.829 --> 00:08:01.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
struck Haiti

00:08:01.831 --> 00:08:03.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Saturday, August 14.

00:08:05.234 --> 00:08:09.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, three Witnesses died

00:08:09.372 --> 00:08:11.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a result.

00:08:11.641 --> 00:08:15.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our hearts
go out to the families of these ones.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The branch office
 recently provided this report

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:22.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the relief efforts.

00:08:24.153 --> 00:08:27.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The earthquake destroyed
approximately 130 of the homes

00:08:27.957 --> 00:08:31.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where our brothers were living

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and damaged another 250.

00:08:35.264 --> 00:08:39.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On Monday, August 16
(two days after the earthquake),

00:08:39.735 --> 00:08:43.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tarps arrived for many of our brothers

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:47.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just ahead of the rains
of Tropical Storm Grace.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:49.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since then,

00:08:49.412 --> 00:08:53.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have distributed over 3 tons of supplies

00:08:53.683 --> 00:08:56.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 28 tons of food to our brothers.

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:59.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tents, tarps, blankets,

00:08:59.422 --> 00:09:02.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mattresses, water filtration kits,

00:09:02.925 --> 00:09:06.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
solar-powered flashlights, 
and solar chargers have been distributed.

00:09:06.929 --> 00:09:09.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally, volunteers are working hard

00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:14.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to evaluate and inspect
the homes of our brothers.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:18.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although in difficult

the local brothers
in the capital of Port-au-Prince

00:09:22.945 --> 00:09:25.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have generously donated

00:09:25.314 --> 00:09:27.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tons of food.

00:09:30.886 --> 00:09:33.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The United States experienced Hurricane Ida,

00:09:33.422 --> 00:09:34.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which made landfall

00:09:34.924 --> 00:09:38.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a Category 4 hurricane

00:09:38.294 --> 00:09:40.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on August 29.

00:09:40.129 --> 00:09:42.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The storm passed from the Gulf Coast

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:44.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the northeast.

00:09:44.867 --> 00:09:48.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The branch office 
reports that as of September 20,

00:09:48.771 --> 00:09:52.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
2,788 of our brothers

00:09:52.074 --> 00:09:56.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who evacuated
are not yet able to return

00:09:56.712 --> 00:09:58.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to their homes.

00:09:58.748 --> 00:10:01.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is estimated to be several weeks

00:10:01.384 --> 00:10:05.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the power is restored in some areas.

00:10:05.554 --> 00:10:10.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The storm damaged
over 1,800 homes of our brothers

00:10:10.192 --> 00:10:13.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and destroyed 28 more.

00:10:13.629 --> 00:10:17.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition, 58 Kingdom Halls

00:10:17.266 --> 00:10:21.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 4 Assembly Halls were damaged.

00:10:21.704 --> 00:10:24.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Under the direction of the circuit overseers,

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
local brothers and sisters
quickly began to stabilize

00:10:28.511 --> 00:10:33.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hundreds of homes
damaged by the storm.

00:10:33.082 --> 00:10:36.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two Disaster Relief Committees
are providing tarps,

00:10:36.285 --> 00:10:38.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
materials, food,

00:10:38.921 --> 00:10:41.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
water, and generators

00:10:41.557 --> 00:10:44.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when local supplies are exhausted.

00:10:44.193 --> 00:10:46.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of this activity is being carried out

00:10:46.629 --> 00:10:49.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with proper safety standards

00:10:49.298 --> 00:10:53.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and appropriate COVID-19 precautions.

00:10:54.003 --> 00:10:56.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are grateful

00:10:56.372 --> 00:11:01.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the hard work of all
who are helping with the relief efforts,

00:11:01.377 --> 00:11:06.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including all of you
who have contributed financially.

00:11:06.382 --> 00:11:08.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you

00:11:08.384 --> 00:11:12.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your generosity and kindness.

00:11:13.989 --> 00:11:18.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s discuss our 2022 yeartext.

00:11:19.862 --> 00:11:22.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the pandemic began,

00:11:22.832 --> 00:11:26.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had no idea it would still be of concern

00:11:26.836 --> 00:11:29.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one and a half years later.

00:11:30.473 --> 00:11:34.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has impacted the economy of many lands.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:39.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result, people,
including many of our brothers and sisters,

00:11:39.215 --> 00:11:42.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not have much materially.

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:45.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some only have meager provisions,

00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:48.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including a scarcity of food.

00:11:50.025 --> 00:11:54.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reminds us of faithful David of old.

00:11:54.497 --> 00:11:58.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was not being hounded by a deadly virus.

00:11:58.334 --> 00:12:03.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he was running
and trying to hide from jealous King Saul,

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:06.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was intent on killing David
and those with him.

00:12:07.943 --> 00:12:10.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Provisions were low,

00:12:10.079 --> 00:12:12.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was very little to eat,

00:12:12.214 --> 00:12:15.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and David lost his home for a time,

00:12:15.451 --> 00:12:19.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hiding out in caves in the wilderness.

00:12:19.688 --> 00:12:23.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While things were very bleak materially,

00:12:23.492 --> 00:12:25.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was at this time

00:12:25.494 --> 00:12:28.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that David composed the beautiful song

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:32.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recorded in Psalm 34.

00:12:32.067 --> 00:12:36.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was he distracted
from his worship of Jehovah?

00:12:36.205 --> 00:12:41.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was he gloomy and dejected
during that difficult time?

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:45.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s read a few verses from Psalm 34

00:12:45.381 --> 00:12:50.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see how David was
(regarding his attitude)

00:12:50.286 --> 00:12:54.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Psalm 34:1.

00:12:54.356 --> 00:12:59.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will praise Jehovah at all times;

00:12:59.328 --> 00:13:04.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his praise will be on my lips constantly.”

00:13:04.467 --> 00:13:07.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in verse 3,

00:13:07.002 --> 00:13:10.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he encouraged others to join him

00:13:10.272 --> 00:13:12.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in praising Jehovah.

00:13:12.274 --> 00:13:14.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 3, David said:

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:19.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Magnify Jehovah along with me;

00:13:19.148 --> 00:13:23.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let us exalt his name together.”

00:13:23.586 --> 00:13:26.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful attitude

00:13:26.589 --> 00:13:31.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite the hardships
he was facing at the time!

00:13:32.761 --> 00:13:37.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So many of you dear brothers and sisters
are struggling economically

00:13:37.766 --> 00:13:42.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during this time of pandemic and uncertainty.

00:13:42.304 --> 00:13:45.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the Governing Body 
wanted me to share with you

00:13:45.274 --> 00:13:49.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially verse 10 of Psalm 34

00:13:49.278 --> 00:13:51.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—verse 10<b>.</b>

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Even strong young lions

00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:57.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“have been reduced to hunger,

00:13:57.353 --> 00:14:00.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but those seeking Jehovah

00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:04.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will lack nothing good.”

00:14:04.927 --> 00:14:09.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The last part of that verse
is the yeartext for 2022.

00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:12.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Those seeking Jehovah

00:14:12.535 --> 00:14:17.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will lack nothing good”—Psalm 34:10.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, obviously, as we’ve been discussing,

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:23.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David was not referring

00:14:23.345 --> 00:14:27.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to an abundance of physical sustenance.

00:14:27.349 --> 00:14:29.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We remember the 23rd Psalm,

00:14:29.985 --> 00:14:32.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where David said something similar.

00:14:32.588 --> 00:14:37.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There he said: “Jehovah is my Shepherd.

00:14:37.126 --> 00:14:40.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will lack nothing.”

00:14:40.362 --> 00:14:44.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The rest of that Psalm
refers to spiritual blessings enjoyed,

00:14:44.833 --> 00:14:48.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though he admitted he walked

00:14:48.103 --> 00:14:51.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the valley of deep shadow.”

00:14:52.408 --> 00:14:54.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout that Psalm,

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:58.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he extols the spiritual blessings he enjoyed.

00:14:58.347 --> 00:15:01.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He concluded by saying at Psalm 23:6:

00:15:01.617 --> 00:15:05.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And I will dwell in the house of Jehovah

00:15:05.354 --> 00:15:08.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all my days.”

00:15:08.657 --> 00:15:10.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is the prayer

00:15:10.659 --> 00:15:13.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of all of Jehovah’s faithful servants

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:16.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in these critical times.

00:15:16.532 --> 00:15:18.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dear friends,

00:15:18.534 --> 00:15:23.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the coronavirus is not the worst trial
to strike out at all mankind,

00:15:23.505 --> 00:15:26.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it won’t be the last.

00:15:26.508 --> 00:15:30.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can expect things
to deteriorate even further

00:15:30.879 --> 00:15:33.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as these last days

00:15:33.349 --> 00:15:36.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
march on to their end.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Economic hardship and other trials

00:15:40.723 --> 00:15:43.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will come and go.

00:15:43.659 --> 00:15:45.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But like the psalmist,

00:15:45.928 --> 00:15:49.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can agree that the 2022 yeartext

00:15:49.999 --> 00:15:52.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will prove true!

00:15:52.835 --> 00:15:54.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Spiritually speaking,

00:15:54.937 --> 00:15:57.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Psalm 34:10 states:

00:15:57.806 --> 00:16:02.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Those seeking Jehovah
will lack nothing good.”

00:16:04.613 --> 00:16:07.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dear brothers and sisters,

00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:10.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we truly and deeply

00:16:10.719 --> 00:16:14.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
love you all very much!

00:16:15.591 --> 00:16:20.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:16:20.162 --> 00:16:24.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is JW Broadcasting®!
