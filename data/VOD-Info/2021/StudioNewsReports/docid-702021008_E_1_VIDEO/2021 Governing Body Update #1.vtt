00:00:01.885 --> 00:00:03.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello, everyone.

00:00:03.887 --> 00:00:06.122 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
For this update, I’d like to talk

00:00:06.122 --> 00:00:08.191 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about what you dear brothers and sisters

00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:11.361 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
have accomplished during the past few months.

00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:14.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah must be very proud of you

00:00:14.864 --> 00:00:17.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—your obedience, your zeal!

00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:22.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In spite of all the obstacles,
you haven’t let up in your service.

00:00:22.472 --> 00:00:27.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the contrary, we’re receiving reports
from one country after another

00:00:27.043 --> 00:00:29.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of peaks in the number of publishers,

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:32.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
placements, regular pioneers,

00:00:32.382 --> 00:00:35.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bible studies, and meeting attendance.

00:00:35.652 --> 00:00:38.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well done, faithful servants of Jehovah!

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, all of us are anxious
to get back in the door-to-door work

00:00:43.993 --> 00:00:46.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and doing public witnessing.

00:00:46.362 --> 00:00:50.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we’re limited to doing
letter writing and telephone witnessing,

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we might feel
that we aren’t accomplishing much.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If that’s the way you feel,
remember what we’re told

00:00:56.639 --> 00:01:00.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Revelation 14:6.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like you to follow along as I read this.

00:01:04.948 --> 00:01:08.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “And I saw another angel

00:01:08.051 --> 00:01:10.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“flying in midheaven,

00:01:10.553 --> 00:01:13.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he had everlasting good news to declare

00:01:13.757 --> 00:01:15.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to those who dwell on the earth,

00:01:15.792 --> 00:01:18.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to every nation and tribe

00:01:18.528 --> 00:01:22.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tongue and people.”

00:01:22.098 --> 00:01:24.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So an angel or a group of angels

00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:27.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are supervising the preaching work.

00:01:27.737 --> 00:01:31.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, just think: Because of our limitations,

00:01:31.374 --> 00:01:34.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the angels may be busier than ever,

00:01:34.144 --> 00:01:38.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making sure that the Kingdom message
reaches the right people.

00:01:38.248 --> 00:01:42.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Otherwise, how would you explain
the increases we are seeing?

00:01:42.886 --> 00:01:45.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You write a letter, and send it out.

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:49.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The recipient reads it, but isn’t interested.

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:51.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What have you accomplished?

00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:53.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve given a witness,

00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:58.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe the most thorough witness
that person has ever received.

00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:01.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some people are never home when we call,

00:02:01.571 --> 00:02:03.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or they never answer the door,

00:02:03.573 --> 00:02:06.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they have no idea what we believe

00:02:06.075 --> 00:02:08.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—until—

00:02:08.111 --> 00:02:12.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until they receive that letter.

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:16.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But suppose someone else in the household
would be interested.

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:20.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The angels might see to it
that that person reads the letter.

00:02:20.323 --> 00:02:24.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve given the angels
something to work with!

00:02:24.828 --> 00:02:29.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or you dial the wrong number

00:02:29.098 --> 00:02:32.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that turns out to be the right number.

00:02:34.003 --> 00:02:38.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were the angels involved
in any of the following experiences?

00:02:38.608 --> 00:02:41.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You be the judge.

00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:44.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A sister in South America
was doing telephone witnessing,

00:02:44.113 --> 00:02:46.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she wasn’t having much success,

00:02:46.883 --> 00:02:48.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she didn’t give up.

00:02:48.885 --> 00:02:53.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She called another number,
and a man answered the phone.

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:56.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sister explained that she was calling
to encourage her neighbors

00:02:56.793 --> 00:02:59.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were suffering because of the pandemic.

00:02:59.028 --> 00:03:01.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she read Jeremiah 29:11,

00:03:01.898 --> 00:03:04.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which says that Jehovah is offering us

00:03:04.334 --> 00:03:07.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a future and a hope.”

00:03:07.637 --> 00:03:09.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then the man said:

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:13.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This phone call was no coincidence

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it was from God.”

00:03:16.145 --> 00:03:19.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He explained that the sister
had called a radio station

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:21.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that she was on the air.

00:03:21.184 --> 00:03:24.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A lot of people were listening to her
at that very moment.

00:03:24.687 --> 00:03:28.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had just been talking
about the pandemic.

00:03:28.491 --> 00:03:31.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sister quickly prayed for strength

00:03:31.327 --> 00:03:34.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then shared
a number of encouraging scriptures

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the radio audience.

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:39.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She also told them about our website.

00:03:39.068 --> 00:03:41.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The host took note of the scriptures

00:03:41.671 --> 00:03:44.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enthusiastically encouraged his listeners

00:03:44.607 --> 00:03:46.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to visit the website.

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:48.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a witness!

00:03:48.511 --> 00:03:52.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, ask yourself, ‘Would the sister
have dialed that number

00:03:52.448 --> 00:03:56.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if she had known she’d be talking
to a radio audience?’

00:03:57.553 --> 00:04:02.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another sister in the United States
was ordering a dress over the phone.

00:04:02.091 --> 00:04:04.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she had prayed to Jehovah for the courage

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give a witness
when the transaction was completed.

00:04:08.131 --> 00:04:10.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She followed through on her prayer.

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:14.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, she commended
the customer service agent for her kindness

00:04:14.804 --> 00:04:18.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then asked if she could read
a scripture from the Bible.

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:20.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The young lady agreed.

00:04:20.977 --> 00:04:24.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It turns out that she had studied
the Bible years earlier,

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she had stopped
because she had a lot going on in her life.

00:04:28.584 --> 00:04:31.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A study was started in the <i>Teach Us </i> book,

00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:36.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the young lady attended
the <i>Zoom</i>  meeting the very next Sunday.

00:04:37.794 --> 00:04:41.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about this one: A brother in Japan

00:04:41.397 --> 00:04:45.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wrote to 100 of his former schoolmates.

00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:48.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now in their 30’s, many of them
were facing problems in the workplace

00:04:48.771 --> 00:04:53.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and had concerns about how to raise
their children properly.

00:04:53.242 --> 00:04:56.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a talk on family life was given
in the congregation,

00:04:56.779 --> 00:05:00.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
29 of his former classmates attended.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now he’s studying with 18 of them.

00:05:06.622 --> 00:05:10.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A sister in Brazil
called a woman on the phone.

00:05:10.326 --> 00:05:14.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It turns out that the phone rang
just as the woman was about to take her life.

00:05:14.464 --> 00:05:18.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She had a lot of problems,
but that call convinced her

00:05:18.501 --> 00:05:20.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God is interested in her.

00:05:20.937 --> 00:05:25.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She accepted a study
and is making great progress.

00:05:26.342 --> 00:05:29.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another sister living on an island
under the France branch

00:05:29.445 --> 00:05:32.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had an appointment with a doctor.

00:05:32.048 --> 00:05:35.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After talking about her own health problems
for a while,

00:05:35.284 --> 00:05:37.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she asked the doctor how he was doing.

00:05:37.653 --> 00:05:39.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was surprised.

00:05:39.288 --> 00:05:44.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said his patients rarely showed
personal interest in him.

00:05:44.093 --> 00:05:48.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This opened the way for the sister
to give a witness.

00:05:48.097 --> 00:05:53.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It turns out that the doctor never answered
the door when the Witnesses called.

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:55.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the end of the conversation,

00:05:55.071 --> 00:05:57.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the doctor said
that for the next appointment,

00:05:57.407 --> 00:05:59.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’d schedule the sister
at the end of the day

00:05:59.942 --> 00:06:02.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they could continue their discussion.

00:06:02.845 --> 00:06:07.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An 80-year-old sister
lives in a rural area in France.

00:06:07.417 --> 00:06:10.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She called a woman
living in an isolated village

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:12.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and talked about the model prayer.

00:06:12.655 --> 00:06:16.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That turned out to be just the right subject.

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:19.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The woman said
that she had been raised by nuns

00:06:19.095 --> 00:06:22.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but had never understood the model prayer.

00:06:22.231 --> 00:06:24.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A Bible study is being conducted each week,

00:06:24.901 --> 00:06:29.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the woman is attending
our <i>Zoom</i>  meetings.

00:06:29.405 --> 00:06:33.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what does each of these experiences
have in common?

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:38.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Someone wrote a letter,
dialed the phone, or spoke up.

00:06:38.347 --> 00:06:41.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers and sisters did what they could

00:06:41.084 --> 00:06:44.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gave the angels something to work with.

00:06:44.454 --> 00:06:47.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So put the angels to work.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take advantage of opportunities
to witness to schoolmates,

00:06:50.426 --> 00:06:54.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
medical personnel, deliverymen, shopkeepers.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A simple way to start any conversation
is to say,

00:06:57.333 --> 00:06:59.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’d like to tell you about a website

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:03.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where millions have found
encouraging information.”

00:07:03.773 --> 00:07:06.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Speaking of our website,
a real effort is being made

00:07:06.943 --> 00:07:11.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to provide up-to-date information on jw.org.

00:07:11.314 --> 00:07:14.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s listen as Brother Herman van Selm,

00:07:14.484 --> 00:07:18.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a helper to the Writing Committee,
tells us about it.

00:07:19.455 --> 00:07:21.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Something remarkable happened

00:07:21.824 --> 00:07:24.060 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in January of last year.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.761 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What was it?

00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:27.296 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The Writing Committee

00:07:27.296 --> 00:07:29.532 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
together with the Coordinators’ Committee

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:32.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
decided that the home page of our website

00:07:32.902 --> 00:07:37.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should feature articles
that are relevant to current events,

00:07:37.673 --> 00:07:39.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
grab the viewers’ attention,

00:07:39.842 --> 00:07:43.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and provide the Bible’s explanation
and advice.

00:07:43.946 --> 00:07:48.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how did that decision made in January

00:07:48.084 --> 00:07:50.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prove to be timely?

00:07:50.086 --> 00:07:54.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, just a few months later,
the pandemic began.

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:59.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the Writing Department
immediately began to develop articles

00:07:59.428 --> 00:08:04.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would address key questions or issues
on the minds of people.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the challenge was

00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:10.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that normally preparing one issue
of <i>Awake!</i>  or <i>Watchtower</i>

00:08:10.273 --> 00:08:13.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can take more than 18 months.

00:08:13.342 --> 00:08:17.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we had to find a way
to prepare articles for the home page

00:08:17.713 --> 00:08:20.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a much shorter time.

00:08:20.716 --> 00:08:23.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gladly, with Jehovah’s help

00:08:23.219 --> 00:08:27.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with the help of the brothers and sisters
in various departments,

00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:30.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the total time for preparing and publishing

00:08:30.059 --> 00:08:32.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one new article for the home page

00:08:32.562 --> 00:08:36.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been reduced to five weeks.

00:08:36.699 --> 00:08:40.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are grateful that a good number
of home page articles

00:08:40.236 --> 00:08:44.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
already have been published
on topics related to the pandemic.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which of these six articles do you think

00:08:47.677 --> 00:08:51.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
received the most visitors on our home page?

00:08:51.847 --> 00:08:54.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The number one article was

00:08:54.917 --> 00:08:59.922 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“What Does the Bible Say
About Pandemics?”

00:08:59.922 --> 00:09:02.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what does that show?

00:09:02.525 --> 00:09:06.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People want to know
how current events are related to the Bible.

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:10.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our website explains in clear language

00:09:10.666 --> 00:09:14.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how world conditions
are fulfilling Bible prophecy.

00:09:14.704 --> 00:09:17.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That makes the information on our website

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
different from what people
may find elsewhere.

00:09:22.445 --> 00:09:24.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters around the world

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:28.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also find the articles helpful.

00:09:28.217 --> 00:09:30.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To give one example,

00:09:30.219 --> 00:09:33.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a couple with teenage children wrote:

00:09:33.889 --> 00:09:37.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

with exactly what we need.”

00:10:01.617 --> 00:10:04.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, many have expressed
how the home page articles

00:10:04.587 --> 00:10:07.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help them in their ministry.

00:10:07.556 --> 00:10:10.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are some of their comments:

From Spain: “They are eye-catching.

00:10:14.597 --> 00:10:19.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

for our current form of ministry.”

00:10:52.301 --> 00:10:56.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These recent developments
with the home page

00:10:56.038 --> 00:10:58.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are a faith-strengthening example

of how the faithful and discreet slave

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
