Welcome, dear brothers and sisters!

00:00:04.454 --> 00:00:07.957 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’m so happy to share with you this update.

00:00:08.692 --> 00:00:12.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has been amazing
to see the Kingdom work move ahead,

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:15.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even during this pandemic.

00:00:15.398 --> 00:00:19.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Various branches are reporting all-time peaks

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the number of publishers, pioneers,

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meeting attendance, and Bible studies.

00:00:26.843 --> 00:00:31.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many have reported peaks
in the Memorial attendance.

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:35.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
the Philippines branch reported

00:00:35.585 --> 00:00:39.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that over 739,000

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
attended the Memorial this year!

00:00:42.092 --> 00:00:46.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is more than three times
the number of publishers.

00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:51.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One hundred congregations,
mostly in urban areas,

00:00:51.768 --> 00:00:56.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reported a Memorial attendance
of at least 500.

00:00:56.306 --> 00:01:00.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means that 50,000 attended the Memorial

00:01:00.543 --> 00:01:04.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in just those 100 congregations!

00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:07.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In various parts of the earth,

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many struggle to obtain food.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the assistance of hundreds
of Disaster Relief Committees,

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:19.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we continue to help our brothers.

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:23.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
in Venezuela, each month,

00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:28.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are providing
an average of 130 tons of food

00:01:28.371 --> 00:01:32.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to 25,000 brothers in need.

00:01:33.777 --> 00:01:37.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One 90-year-old pioneer sister said:

00:01:37.413 --> 00:01:40.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I know that the aid comes from Jehovah,

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but he uses brothers
that I do not even know,

00:01:44.821 --> 00:01:48.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and yet they love me and help me.

00:01:48.725 --> 00:01:51.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, dear family.”

00:01:53.963 --> 00:01:57.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is heartwarming
to see how Jehovah is helping

00:01:57.901 --> 00:02:02.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers and sisters in Venezuela
and around the globe.

00:02:02.839 --> 00:02:06.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thank all of you for making that possible

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of your donations.

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our last <i>Governing Body Update,</i>
Brother Herd mentioned

00:02:13.983 --> 00:02:17.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “about 50 percent
of the worldwide Bethel family

00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:21.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been vaccinated so far.”

00:02:21.257 --> 00:02:25.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Initially, it seemed impossible
to obtain vaccines

00:02:25.495 --> 00:02:28.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in some countries of the world.

00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:30.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it has been amazing to see

00:02:30.867 --> 00:02:33.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that now more than 80 percent

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our worldwide Bethel family

00:02:36.506 --> 00:02:40.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is, more than 19,000 Bethelites—

00:02:40.677 --> 00:02:42.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are vaccinated,

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:46.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we are doing what we can
to assist the branch offices

00:02:46.883 --> 00:02:50.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have not been able to obtain vaccines.

00:02:51.621 --> 00:02:55.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you know,
by keeping the Bethel family safe,

00:02:55.124 --> 00:02:58.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we protect the flow of spiritual food

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:02.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and support spiritual activities worldwide.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On behalf of the Governing Body,

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:08.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thank you, dear brothers and sisters,

00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:11.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your tremendous cooperation

00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:15.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all the arrangements
during the pandemic.

00:03:15.778 --> 00:03:19.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There have been many adjustments
in a short time,

00:03:19.515 --> 00:03:22.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you have done so well.

00:03:22.752 --> 00:03:27.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We truly love you for your fine spirit

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in working “shoulder to shoulder” with us.

00:03:32.228 --> 00:03:35.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While we all have had changes in our routine,

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:40.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of our circuit overseers
who serve in foreign lands

00:03:40.203 --> 00:03:42.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have had major changes.

00:03:42.672 --> 00:03:47.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had to return to their home countries
during the pandemic.

00:03:47.443 --> 00:03:50.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even so, some continue to serve

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the congregations in their circuits via Zoom,

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite being in a different country

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:59.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in a different time zone.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s hear from one.

00:04:04.761 --> 00:04:06.763 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
A few months into the pandemic,

00:04:06.763 --> 00:04:09.499 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
my father’s health was failing.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.067 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So we made the decision

00:04:11.067 --> 00:04:12.502 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to return to the States

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:14.437 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and assist my mother.

00:04:14.437 --> 00:04:17.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although in the beginning
we didn’t think we’d be here so long,

00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:21.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it turned out that the surge in the pandemic

00:04:21.577 --> 00:04:25.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prevented us from going back
to our assignment in the circuit in Bolivia.

00:04:25.548 --> 00:04:28.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, being displaced,
we just weren’t sure

00:04:28.318 --> 00:04:32.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we were going to be able to serve
and complete our assignment effectively.

00:04:32.322 --> 00:04:34.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We felt that we needed to make

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the necessary adjustments
to have the right attitude.

00:04:37.627 --> 00:04:42.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So fervent prayer really helped us
to get the right mindset.

00:04:42.332 --> 00:04:46.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And being able to see
how Jehovah answered those prayers

00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:48.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is very faith-strengthening.

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:50.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is blessing this arrangement.

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:52.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the arrangement
that has been put in place,

00:04:52.408 --> 00:04:53.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s what we’re using.

00:04:53.776 --> 00:04:55.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re making the best of it.

00:04:55.278 --> 00:04:58.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we’re having success
because Jehovah is behind it.

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:01.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve had brothers who are now qualified

00:05:01.851 --> 00:05:03.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be publishers
—unbaptized publishers.

00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:06.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are brothers
who’ve dedicated their lives

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gotten baptized during this pandemic.

00:05:09.058 --> 00:05:13.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One brother in particular
has so much enthusiasm for phone witnessing

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that last month he was able
to report over 100 return visits,

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:22.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was able to show
over 200 videos to different ones.

00:05:22.705 --> 00:05:27.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One Bible student loves her study so much,
and also attending meetings,

00:05:27.643 --> 00:05:30.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she’s willing to walk one hour each way

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to have a good signal on her phone

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:37.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that she can tie in to her study
and also to the meetings.

00:05:37.086 --> 00:05:38.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout this past year,

00:05:38.855 --> 00:05:42.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve learned that Jehovah has never left us.

00:05:42.325 --> 00:05:45.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s been in total control
of every situation.

00:05:45.895 --> 00:05:50.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s been able to direct
his organization, his people,

00:05:50.466 --> 00:05:52.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
exactly to the place that we need to be.

00:05:52.935 --> 00:05:57.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This has all been proof
that Jehovah will never abandon us.

00:06:00.376 --> 00:06:04.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How encouraging to hear how our brothers

00:06:04.213 --> 00:06:08.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are remaining united and spiritually active!

00:06:08.684 --> 00:06:13.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we do have to continue
to guard our unity.

00:06:13.256 --> 00:06:15.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is unity?

00:06:15.258 --> 00:06:18.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has been defined as “oneness,”

00:06:18.394 --> 00:06:20.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a condition of harmony.”

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Note how the apostle Paul describes our role

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in maintaining unity at Ephesians 4:3.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There we read:

00:06:32.775 --> 00:06:36.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“earnestly endeavoring to maintain

00:06:36.045 --> 00:06:38.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the oneness of the spirit

00:06:38.147 --> 00:06:41.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the uniting bond of peace.”

00:06:41.918 --> 00:06:45.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Note that it takes effort
to maintain our unity.

00:06:45.955 --> 00:06:49.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul said that we must “earnestly endeavor,”

00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:51.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or work hard, at it.

00:06:52.562 --> 00:06:56.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What could pose a danger to our unity?

00:06:56.332 --> 00:07:00.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if we
became too emotionally involved

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:03.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in issues that are divisive?

00:07:03.239 --> 00:07:07.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible foretold at 2 Timothy chapter 3

00:07:07.076 --> 00:07:10.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that men would be “lovers of themselves,

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:12.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . not open to any agreement,

00:07:12.882 --> 00:07:15.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . [and] fierce.”

00:07:15.084 --> 00:07:17.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see this in the world today.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People are “not open to any agreement.”

00:07:21.357 --> 00:07:24.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They quickly become “fierce,”

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taking strong positions
on all types of issues.

00:07:28.431 --> 00:07:32.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Christians,
we are “no part of [the] world.”

00:07:32.401 --> 00:07:35.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We stay out of those debates.

00:07:36.072 --> 00:07:38.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
who would have thought

00:07:38.341 --> 00:07:42.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that wearing a mask
to prevent the spread of disease

00:07:42.245 --> 00:07:44.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could become an issue?

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the time when we were little children,

00:07:47.383 --> 00:07:50.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our parents taught us to cover our mouth

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:53.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we coughed or sneezed.

00:07:53.222 --> 00:07:55.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In his precious Word,

00:07:55.291 --> 00:07:58.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah outlined many practical measures

00:07:58.127 --> 00:08:01.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would prevent the spread of disease.

00:08:01.063 --> 00:08:05.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how could wearing a mask
become controversial for some?

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:08.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where is that thinking coming from?

00:08:10.039 --> 00:08:12.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to be careful.

00:08:12.542 --> 00:08:15.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of us are exposed to worldly thinking

00:08:15.478 --> 00:08:18.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on television, on the Internet,

00:08:18.614 --> 00:08:20.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at work, or at school.

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:25.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many websites
that promote conspiracy theories.

00:08:25.688 --> 00:08:27.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re not careful,

00:08:27.723 --> 00:08:32.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could become emotionally involved
in these debates.

00:08:32.495 --> 00:08:36.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could allow ourselves to be guided
by “the voice of strangers”

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:40.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
instead of listening to Jehovah’s channel,

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:42.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the faithful and discreet slave.”

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:46.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we face the end of this system of things,

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:49.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this will become more and more essential

00:08:49.845 --> 00:08:53.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our safety and spirituality.

00:08:53.516 --> 00:08:58.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why we appreciate
you dear brothers and sisters so much.

00:08:59.522 --> 00:09:02.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As soon as you discern that Jehovah’s spirit

00:09:02.525 --> 00:09:06.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is directing the Governing Body
to go in a certain way,

00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:08.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are quick to follow.

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:13.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as a result, we enjoy precious unity.

00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:19.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This reminds me
of the Bible example of Naaman.

00:09:19.442 --> 00:09:23.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through a messenger,
the prophet Elisha told Naaman

00:09:23.746 --> 00:09:25.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would be healed from his leprosy

00:09:25.848 --> 00:09:29.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if he bathed seven times in the Jordan River.

00:09:29.785 --> 00:09:33.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did Naaman react?

00:09:33.155 --> 00:09:35.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read together

00:09:35.458 --> 00:09:39.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
2 Kings 5:11, 12:

00:09:40.029 --> 00:09:43.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At this Naaman became indignant

00:09:43.733 --> 00:09:46.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and started to leave, saying:

00:09:46.335 --> 00:09:48.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Here I said to myself,

00:09:48.337 --> 00:09:50.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“He will come out to me and stand here

00:09:50.973 --> 00:09:53.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“and call on the name of Jehovah his God,

00:09:53.276 --> 00:09:55.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“moving his hand back and forth

00:09:55.344 --> 00:09:57.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘over the leprosy to cure it.”

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Are not the Abanah and the Pharpar,

00:10:00.483 --> 00:10:02.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘the rivers of Damascus,

00:10:02.485 --> 00:10:05.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘better than all the waters of Israel?

00:10:05.221 --> 00:10:08.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Can I not wash in them and become clean?’

00:10:08.324 --> 00:10:12.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With that he turned and went away in a rage.”

00:10:12.595 --> 00:10:15.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Naaman had his own idea

00:10:15.564 --> 00:10:18.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how he was going to be cured.

00:10:18.434 --> 00:10:21.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He felt strongly about it.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:23.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah had a different idea.

00:10:23.939 --> 00:10:25.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To be cured,

00:10:25.274 --> 00:10:28.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Naaman would have to humble himself

00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:32.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and follow direction from Jehovah’s channel.

00:10:32.014 --> 00:10:34.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Naaman was struggling,

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but his servants got the point.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did they tell him to do?

00:10:39.789 --> 00:10:41.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what was the result?

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:45.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read verses 13 and 14:

00:10:47.096 --> 00:10:50.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“His servants now approached him and said:

00:10:50.433 --> 00:10:53.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘My father, if the prophet had told you

00:10:53.602 --> 00:10:55.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘to do something extraordinary,

00:10:55.871 --> 00:10:58.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘would you not do it?

00:10:58.074 --> 00:11:00.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘How much more, then, since he

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:03.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“only said to you, “Wash and be clean”?’

00:11:03.145 --> 00:11:05.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At that he went down

00:11:05.147 --> 00:11:08.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and plunged into the Jordan seven times,

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:09.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“according to the word

00:11:09.885 --> 00:11:12.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of the man of the true God.

00:11:13.356 --> 00:11:15.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then his flesh was restored

00:11:15.624 --> 00:11:17.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“like the flesh of a little boy,

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he became clean.”

00:11:21.263 --> 00:11:23.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we get the point?

00:11:23.733 --> 00:11:27.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Naaman,
we might struggle a bit at times,

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially if we have
our own strong viewpoint.

00:11:31.774 --> 00:11:33.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But one thing is certain:

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:37.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we follow direction
coming from Jehovah’s channel,

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will be blessed

00:11:39.382 --> 00:11:43.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, more important,
we will remain united.

00:11:44.787 --> 00:11:48.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, the Devil is not happy
to see this cooperation

00:11:48.758 --> 00:11:52.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this beautiful unity that we enjoy—

00:11:52.361 --> 00:11:56.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we have to be on guard
so as to maintain it.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This reminds me of an event in my life,
many years ago,

00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:05.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when this lesson was impressed on my mind.

00:12:05.241 --> 00:12:09.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time,
some of the brothers did become divided

00:12:09.645 --> 00:12:12.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it led to so many problems.

00:12:12.748 --> 00:12:14.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may remember

00:12:14.183 --> 00:12:17.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we had a video about those events.

00:12:17.553 --> 00:12:20.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch a clip from that video.

00:12:23.092 --> 00:12:26.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A lot of pressure was
on the brothers in Romania.

00:12:26.595 --> 00:12:29.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Communist Party tried

00:12:29.899 --> 00:12:32.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to sow distrust among the brothers,

00:12:32.868 --> 00:12:35.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meeting with them separately

00:12:35.037 --> 00:12:37.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and telling some brothers one thing

00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:39.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and telling other brothers something else.

00:12:40.376 --> 00:12:42.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes it happened

00:12:42.511 --> 00:12:44.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that an official posed
as an interested person

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was clever enough to disguise that

00:12:48.951 --> 00:12:52.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pretend to make progress in the truth

00:12:52.688 --> 00:12:55.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not only to the point of getting baptized

00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:59.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but even to the point of becoming an elder.

00:12:59.495 --> 00:13:04.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he was in reality
an agent of the secret police

00:13:04.633 --> 00:13:07.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with an aim to find out everything
about the organization.

00:13:08.404 --> 00:13:11.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it did lead to, in one case,

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:16.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers starting to distrust someone

00:13:16.078 --> 00:13:18.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was actually appointed by headquarters.

00:13:18.914 --> 00:13:21.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And these brothers then separated

00:13:21.684 --> 00:13:25.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the organization that Jehovah used,

00:13:25.855 --> 00:13:28.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some of them were separated

00:13:28.123 --> 00:13:31.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for not just a few years but for decades.

00:13:31.994 --> 00:13:34.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they were a large number,

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
up to 5,000 publishers.

00:13:37.299 --> 00:13:39.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They continued to meet together.

00:13:40.002 --> 00:13:45.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were preaching and using material
that they had left over from earlier years,

00:13:45.007 --> 00:13:48.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they hardly got any new material to study

00:13:48.377 --> 00:13:51.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they were not in touch
with the organization

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was used by headquarters.

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:58.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Attempts to bring the brothers back
into the organization

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were made from time to time,

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:06.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it seemed that the brothers
from the separated organization

00:14:06.195 --> 00:14:08.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did not have sufficient trust.

00:14:08.464 --> 00:14:12.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when we presented

00:14:12.334 --> 00:14:15.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the leader of the separated group

00:14:15.638 --> 00:14:19.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that one from the Governing Body would come,

00:14:19.808 --> 00:14:21.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was happy about that

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he had enough trust in that case

00:14:24.947 --> 00:14:27.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to agree that we should have a meeting

00:14:27.816 --> 00:14:31.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seriously talk about reunification.

00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:35.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so from the separated group,

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:38.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were Brother Albu, who was the leader,

00:14:38.093 --> 00:14:40.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and four of his main elders.

00:14:40.563 --> 00:14:42.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And from our side,

00:14:42.565 --> 00:14:46.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was Brother Jaracz, our translator,

00:14:46.001 --> 00:14:48.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I was part of that group.

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:50.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, there were

00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:54.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
several from the Country Committee of Romania.

00:14:56.312 --> 00:14:58.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember that the first night

00:14:58.514 --> 00:15:01.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were a lot of accusations

00:15:01.016 --> 00:15:04.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what the others had done or not done,

00:15:04.253 --> 00:15:06.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which did not create the best spirit,

00:15:06.755 --> 00:15:08.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we mainly listened.

00:15:10.125 --> 00:15:14.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But everybody agreed to meet another night.

00:15:14.363 --> 00:15:17.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the second night,
Jehovah obviously wanted

00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:19.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers to unite again

00:15:19.535 --> 00:15:22.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the whole spirit was different,

00:15:22.137 --> 00:15:25.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the brothers talked the matters over

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:27.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and clarified some misunderstandings.

00:15:27.676 --> 00:15:31.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at the end of the second evening,
I remember

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the leader of the separated group,
Brother Albu, said,

00:15:34.516 --> 00:15:37.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Let’s do it because if we don’t do it now,

00:15:37.386 --> 00:15:40.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may never have another opportunity again.’

00:15:43.325 --> 00:15:46.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so the decision was made.

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:52.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That doesn’t happen every day
that 5,000 brothers

00:15:52.034 --> 00:15:55.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
come back to the organization.

00:15:57.473 --> 00:16:01.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From then on,
all the practical things

00:16:01.076 --> 00:16:04.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were put in place
to accomplish this reunification.

00:16:04.913 --> 00:16:09.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were asked to merge
with our congregations.

00:16:09.351 --> 00:16:13.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that also took
a lot of humility on their part,

00:16:14.523 --> 00:16:16.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they were willing to do it.

00:16:16.625 --> 00:16:20.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they were really brothers

00:16:20.863 --> 00:16:22.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their heart

00:16:22.898 --> 00:16:24.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and loved the truth.

00:16:24.967 --> 00:16:28.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so the reunification was accomplished,

00:16:28.404 --> 00:16:33.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that was a wonderful victory for Jehovah
and against Satan.

00:16:35.077 --> 00:16:37.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reflecting on the experience

00:16:37.179 --> 00:16:39.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the brothers in Romania,
we can see

00:16:39.715 --> 00:16:44.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there could always be
misunderstandings among humans

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there could always be
even legitimate complaints

00:16:49.458 --> 00:16:54.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the misconduct
of some responsible brothers.

00:16:54.196 --> 00:16:56.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the important thing is

00:16:56.398 --> 00:17:00.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
never to lose trust
that this is Jehovah’s organization.

00:17:00.969 --> 00:17:03.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s where Jehovah’s blessing is.

00:17:03.706 --> 00:17:06.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sees it all.

00:17:06.041 --> 00:17:08.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah uses his holy spirit

00:17:08.677 --> 00:17:10.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep the organization together,

00:17:10.979 --> 00:17:15.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what he wants to have accomplished
will happen.

00:17:15.017 --> 00:17:17.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we work with the holy spirit,

00:17:17.419 --> 00:17:20.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then Jehovah will bless our efforts

00:17:20.055 --> 00:17:23.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it will be successful to his praise.

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:31.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course,
these challenges were not unique

00:17:31.366 --> 00:17:33.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the brothers in Romania.

00:17:33.368 --> 00:17:37.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Similar challenges
occurred in other countries

00:17:37.206 --> 00:17:39.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were behind the Iron Curtain,

00:17:39.241 --> 00:17:43.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including Czechoslovakia,
Russia, and Ukraine.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:49.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what have we learned in this update?

00:17:49.685 --> 00:17:53.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s organization is on the move.

00:17:53.822 --> 00:17:55.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even during this pandemic,

00:17:55.891 --> 00:18:00.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see strong evidence
that Jehovah’s spirit is blessing

00:18:00.162 --> 00:18:04.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and moving ahead
the preaching and disciple-making work.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:08.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite many challenges,
you dear brothers and sisters

00:18:08.904 --> 00:18:13.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are working hard
to maintain our precious unity.

00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:18.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result,
we are enjoying a spiritual paradise

00:18:18.347 --> 00:18:21.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we work unitedly together.

00:18:22.451 --> 00:18:26.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan will continue to try
to stir up division,

00:18:26.288 --> 00:18:28.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even among Jehovah’s people.

00:18:28.824 --> 00:18:33.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we do
to successfully resist his efforts?

00:18:33.829 --> 00:18:37.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen to the channel that Jehovah is using,

00:18:37.666 --> 00:18:40.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the faithful and discreet slave.”

00:18:40.803 --> 00:18:44.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t allow yourself
to become emotionally involved

00:18:44.873 --> 00:18:48.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the causes of this world,
whatever they may be.

00:18:48.777 --> 00:18:52.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no doubt
that Jehovah will richly bless

00:18:52.314 --> 00:18:56.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all those who support our King, Jesus Christ,

00:18:56.151 --> 00:18:58.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the channel that he is using today,

00:18:58.954 --> 00:19:01.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the faithful and discreet slave.”

00:19:03.225 --> 00:19:06.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
