00:00:01.084 --> 00:00:02.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome, everyone!

00:00:03.486 --> 00:00:04.888 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In this update,

00:00:04.888 --> 00:00:06.156 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I thought we might reflect

00:00:06.156 --> 00:00:08.291 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on Jehovah’s goodness

00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:12.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the way he’s been guiding
his people during the pandemic.

00:00:12.362 --> 00:00:15.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure we all agree
with the words of the psalmist

00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:18.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found at Psalm 27:13:

00:00:18.735 --> 00:00:21.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Where would I be

00:00:21.171 --> 00:00:23.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“if I did not have faith

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:26.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that I would see Jehovah’s goodness

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the land of the living?”

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Where would I be?”

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:33.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s something to think about, isn’t it?

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How grateful we are to be
associated with Jehovah’s organization

00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:42.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to benefit
from its direction and guidance,

00:00:42.058 --> 00:00:45.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially when we see where we could be

00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:48.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in the confused and divided world around us.

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:52.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With your eyes of faith,

00:00:52.068 --> 00:00:55.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you see Jehovah
as directing his people today?

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we know he is interested
in our spiritual well-being.

00:01:01.211 --> 00:01:05.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about our physical well-being
—our health?

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:07.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does he care about that?

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:12.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If he does, will he make sure
that we get good advice

00:01:12.589 --> 00:01:15.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even on health matters?

00:01:15.558 --> 00:01:19.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To answer that, let’s consider
the promise Jehovah made

00:01:19.395 --> 00:01:23.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as found at Psalm 32:8.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is one we know well, but let’s
look at this from another perspective.

00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:30.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Psalm 32:8.

00:01:30.406 --> 00:01:31.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says:

00:01:31.908 --> 00:01:36.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will give you insight

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and instruct you in the way you should go.

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will give you advice

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:46.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with my eye upon you.”

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:51.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here’s a promise that Jehovah
will give us the advice we need.

00:01:51.294 --> 00:01:54.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But advice on what subject?

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:57.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think back to the days of Israel.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was Jehovah interested in the health
and safety of his people back then?

00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:04.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He certainly was.

00:02:04.107 --> 00:02:07.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He instructed the Israelites
to quarantine the sick.

00:02:07.811 --> 00:02:11.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He told them not to eat
unclean birds and animals

00:02:11.114 --> 00:02:14.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because doing so could have been
harmful for their health.

00:02:14.517 --> 00:02:19.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he insisted that they build
a parapet around the flat roof of their homes

00:02:19.155 --> 00:02:21.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so no one would fall off.

00:02:21.324 --> 00:02:23.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He loved his people.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wanted them to be safe.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah hasn’t changed.

00:02:29.132 --> 00:02:33.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He still cares about the health 
and safety of his people.

00:02:33.303 --> 00:02:35.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in the psalm we just read,

00:02:35.338 --> 00:02:37.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he promised to give us insight,

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
instruction, and advice.

00:02:41.845 --> 00:02:44.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does he do that today?

00:02:44.714 --> 00:02:48.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He does it by means of his organization.

00:02:49.986 --> 00:02:54.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some countries, there’s been
considerable confusion and disagreement

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over how to deal with the pandemic.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some chafe at the idea of wearing masks,

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:03.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they refuse
to practice physical distancing,

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:06.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when these precautions are required.

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:11.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re reminded of Paul’s words
at 1 Corinthians 14:33.

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:13.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember that one?

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:18.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God is a God not of disorder
but of peace,” the Bible says.

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:21.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The disorder we see in the world

00:03:21.184 --> 00:03:25.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is proof positive
that Jehovah is not with them.

00:03:25.321 --> 00:03:27.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But from Jehovah’s organization,

00:03:27.657 --> 00:03:30.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve had clear direction
from the very beginning.

00:03:30.994 --> 00:03:33.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we thank Jehovah for it.

00:03:34.564 --> 00:03:37.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
think of the information we’ve received

00:03:37.934 --> 00:03:40.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through recent Governing Body updates.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is evidence of Jehovah’s
loving direction—his goodness.

00:03:45.775 --> 00:03:50.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In last month’s update,
Brother Lett made a very important point.

00:03:50.446 --> 00:03:54.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He reminded us that the information
we’re receiving regarding the pandemic

00:03:54.517 --> 00:03:57.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is prepared by faithful brothers.

00:03:57.987 --> 00:03:59.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can trust them.

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They aren’t motivated by some
personal view or political agenda.

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:06.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They love us.

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They want the best for us.

00:04:09.866 --> 00:04:13.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hear someone ask, ‘What do they know?’

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:15.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wrong question.

00:04:15.538 --> 00:04:19.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think the right question is,
What does Jehovah know?

00:04:20.576 --> 00:04:22.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It comes down to this, friends:

00:04:22.912 --> 00:04:24.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do I really believe

00:04:24.948 --> 00:04:28.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is directing
this organization today?

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:33.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do I believe that Jehovah
will give insight to his faithful people

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they can remain “in the land
of the living,” as the psalmist said?

00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:41.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To repeat the question
we often raise in field service, 

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:44.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does God really care?

00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:50.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would Jehovah allow the Governing Body,
the helpers, missionaries,

00:04:50.873 --> 00:04:53.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a huge percentage
of the worldwide Bethel family,

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other full-time servants
to engage in practices

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or receive a COVID-19 vaccine
that would be harmful?

00:05:01.484 --> 00:05:05.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Surely Jehovah wants
the brothers at world headquarters 

00:05:05.254 --> 00:05:08.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to continue providing spiritual food.

00:05:08.191 --> 00:05:10.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants to make sure
that the work continues

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:13.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at our branch offices and in the field.

00:05:13.196 --> 00:05:17.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To do that, we have to be
“in the land of the living.”

00:05:19.035 --> 00:05:22.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what about the prophecy
that ‘a great crowd

00:05:22.038 --> 00:05:26.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which no man can number’
will come out of the great tribulation?

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:30.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our God is definitely not like Pharaoh,
who wanted to kill off

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:33.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an entire generation
of Jehovah’s worshippers.

00:05:33.883 --> 00:05:35.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are convinced

00:05:35.952 --> 00:05:40.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah cares about the health
and safety of his people

00:05:40.957 --> 00:05:44.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he will guide us, saying, in effect:

00:05:44.127 --> 00:05:46.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is the way.

00:05:46.162 --> 00:05:48.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Walk in it,” you people.

00:05:49.832 --> 00:05:52.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we embark on a certain course,

00:05:52.535 --> 00:05:55.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we always look for evidence
of Jehovah’s blessing

00:05:55.371 --> 00:05:58.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see whether
we’re on the right track or not.

00:05:58.508 --> 00:06:03.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So has Jehovah blessed
our efforts during this pandemic?

00:06:04.747 --> 00:06:07.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, indeed.

00:06:07.116 --> 00:06:11.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, of course, the pandemic has
slowed activities for many of our brothers,

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially in areas
without good Internet connections.

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:18.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of everything you’ve
accomplished in recent months.

00:06:18.161 --> 00:06:21.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many congregations
are reporting record attendances

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at our virtual congregation meetings.

00:06:23.966 --> 00:06:28.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Inactive ones are returning to Jehovah,
and how we thank God for that!

00:06:28.871 --> 00:06:31.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our Memorial attendance for 2021

00:06:31.741 --> 00:06:34.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reached an all-time peak

00:06:34.277 --> 00:06:40.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 21,367,603.

00:06:41.751 --> 00:06:44.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And many branches
have reported new all-time peaks

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:46.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the number of publishers.

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:48.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s not all.

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:53.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve shown exemplary concern
and brotherly affection for one another,

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:58.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
proving that you
truly are Christ’s disciples.

00:06:58.334 --> 00:07:02.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We commend you most warmly.

00:07:02.004 --> 00:07:06.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who can deny that Jehovah
is blessing your work?

00:07:07.577 --> 00:07:11.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And consider what the Bethel family
has been able to accomplish

00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:15.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the pandemic,
only with Jehovah’s blessing.

00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:20.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all appreciate our beautiful
new publication, <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>

00:07:20.056 --> 00:07:22.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a tremendous amount of work

00:07:22.458 --> 00:07:26.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
involving hundreds of hours of overtime.

00:07:26.162 --> 00:07:29.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s not all that was accomplished
during the pandemic.

00:07:29.432 --> 00:07:31.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about the monthly broadcasts?

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:34.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We never missed one.

00:07:34.737 --> 00:07:39.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then there are the beautiful videos,
our regional conventions,

00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:42.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Gilead graduations,
and the annual meetings.

00:07:42.778 --> 00:07:44.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of this was possible

00:07:44.847 --> 00:07:49.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the Bethel family stayed healthy.

00:07:50.686 --> 00:07:54.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many brothers and sisters
have written to express appreciation

00:07:54.157 --> 00:07:57.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for knowing what precautions
we’re taking at world headquarters.

00:07:57.393 --> 00:07:59.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:07:59.061 --> 00:08:01.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Simple.

00:08:01.063 --> 00:08:04.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you think of another group
in Jehovah’s organization

00:08:04.467 --> 00:08:08.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would be more at risk of infection
than the Bethel family?

00:08:08.771 --> 00:08:12.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hundreds of us live together,
work together, eat together,

00:08:12.675 --> 00:08:16.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
share the same surfaces day in and day out.

00:08:16.112 --> 00:08:18.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, many brothers and sisters have concluded

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:23.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that what works for the Bethel family
is likely to work for them.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:29.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now we’re moving
into another phase of the pandemic.

00:08:29.292 --> 00:08:31.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wasn’t it exciting to see

00:08:31.327 --> 00:08:32.995 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the recent JW News article

00:08:32.995 --> 00:08:34.463 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about the pilot program

00:08:34.463 --> 00:08:36.832 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to resume in-person congregation meetings

00:08:36.832 --> 00:08:38.334 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in selected lands?

00:08:38.334 --> 00:08:42.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been a long time since we’ve been
able to be together in person.

00:08:44.073 --> 00:08:48.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might be wondering
what led up to the pilot program.

00:08:48.578 --> 00:08:52.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Governing Body committees
have been prayerfully evaluating when

00:08:52.648 --> 00:08:56.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how to resume in-person meetings safely.

00:08:56.652 --> 00:09:01.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Earlier this year, it didn’t seem
to be the right time to start.

00:09:01.424 --> 00:09:06.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Vaccines weren’t available
in many lands, infection rates were high,

00:09:06.295 --> 00:09:10.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Delta variant was rapidly spreading.

00:09:10.733 --> 00:09:13.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in September,

00:09:13.069 --> 00:09:15.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the situation started to appear more hopeful,

00:09:15.838 --> 00:09:19.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at least in some areas of the world.

00:09:19.075 --> 00:09:21.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In October,

00:09:21.077 --> 00:09:25.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
17 branches were approved
to participate in a pilot program

00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:28.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to resume in-person congregation meetings.

00:09:29.218 --> 00:09:34.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These branches represent
a variety of circumstances and continents:

00:09:34.123 --> 00:09:37.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Africa, Asia, Australia,

00:09:37.627 --> 00:09:40.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Europe, North and South America.

00:09:40.396 --> 00:09:42.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the Branch Committees
in all these countries

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:46.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
need to consider carefully
what the local government regulations are

00:09:46.936 --> 00:09:51.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for such indoor gatherings
as our congregation meetings.

00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:54.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The regulations vary from country to country.

00:09:56.245 --> 00:10:01.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might be wondering,
does this mean that Zoom is going away?

00:10:02.585 --> 00:10:06.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re pleased to inform you
that approval has been given 

00:10:06.656 --> 00:10:08.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for congregations in the pilot program

00:10:08.724 --> 00:10:12.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have the option
of holding hybrid meetings,

00:10:12.094 --> 00:10:14.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where some attend
in person at the Kingdom Hall

00:10:14.897 --> 00:10:18.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while others are tied in via Zoom.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As of November 8,

00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:23.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
14 branches have already
held their first meetings.

00:10:23.539 --> 00:10:25.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you can imagine,

00:10:25.541 --> 00:10:29.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers and sisters
were overjoyed to meet together again.

00:10:29.779 --> 00:10:31.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s hear from a few of them.

00:10:33.649 --> 00:10:34.717 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When it was announced

00:10:34.717 --> 00:10:35.751 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
at the midweek meeting

00:10:35.751 --> 00:10:38.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our congregation
had been invited to hold

00:10:38.487 --> 00:10:40.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in-person meetings as part of a project,

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:42.191 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was so happy that I

00:10:42.191 --> 00:10:43.726 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
jumped out of my chair for joy.

00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:45.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a tremendous emotion!

00:10:47.863 --> 00:10:49.265 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t believe it,

00:10:49.265 --> 00:10:50.866 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that it was actually happening.

00:10:50.866 --> 00:10:52.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of a sudden out of nowhere
—we’re coming back!

00:10:52.702 --> 00:10:54.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we walk in the hall and you’re like,

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:56.205 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“These are all my brothers and sisters,

00:10:56.205 --> 00:10:57.473 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and we’re all together.”

00:10:57.473 --> 00:10:59.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You just felt like you were at home.

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:06.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being back at the meetings,

00:11:06.882 --> 00:11:08.751 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I feel like the fire is burning

00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:11.020 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in my heart because of happiness.

00:11:15.591 --> 00:11:17.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really felt good.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.095 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It was lovely to see

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:20.429 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the brothers and sisters coming into

00:11:20.429 --> 00:11:22.732 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the entranceway, and to greet them

00:11:22.732 --> 00:11:24.734 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was so great.

00:11:24.734 --> 00:11:26.168 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to go

00:11:26.168 --> 00:11:28.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and give somebody a very big hug.

00:11:28.504 --> 00:11:30.339 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But since I couldn’t,

00:11:30.339 --> 00:11:32.375 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I would go to Mom and Dad

00:11:32.375 --> 00:11:36.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hug them and say,
“This is for this person.”

00:11:43.652 --> 00:11:47.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being able to be at the Kingdom Hall,
I had to pinch myself

00:11:47.189 --> 00:11:49.058 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to make sure I was not dreaming.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.395 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
On the way there,

00:11:52.395 --> 00:11:53.963 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we were really excited.

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:55.231 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And when we finally went inside,

00:11:55.231 --> 00:11:58.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seeing the friends, hugging them

00:11:58.334 --> 00:12:00.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it was really an indescribable feeling.

00:12:05.007 --> 00:12:07.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’d like to take your seats,
we will get our meeting underway.

00:12:08.911 --> 00:12:10.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To hear the singing, even with the masks on, 

00:12:10.946 --> 00:12:13.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was really encouraging.

00:12:18.287 --> 00:12:20.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love the singing.

00:12:20.322 --> 00:12:22.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think everyone got better 
over the 18 months.

00:12:22.324 --> 00:12:23.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all got to practice.

00:12:23.659 --> 00:12:25.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was beautiful!

00:12:50.986 --> 00:12:53.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It felt like going home to my family.

00:12:55.591 --> 00:12:57.893 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Being able to sing together

00:12:57.893 --> 00:13:00.696 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with brothers and sisters in person,

00:13:00.696 --> 00:13:04.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being able to stretch my hand again

00:13:04.467 --> 00:13:08.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all in our congregation
were delighted to be part of it.

00:13:11.574 --> 00:13:13.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being at home is more comfortable.

00:13:13.776 --> 00:13:14.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you can be

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:17.213 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
distracted by any little thing.

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:19.548 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But being here is much better

00:13:19.548 --> 00:13:21.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we pay
more attention to the meetings.

00:13:35.865 --> 00:13:39.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was baptized in 2020
during the regional convention.

00:13:39.502 --> 00:13:43.239 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s now over a year since I got baptized,

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:47.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but this is my first time at the Kingdom Hall
as a baptized brother.

00:13:48.611 --> 00:13:50.613 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Since it is my first time at the hall

00:13:50.613 --> 00:13:51.947 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
at a meeting in person,

00:13:51.947 --> 00:13:55.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt so happy and also nervous

00:13:55.217 --> 00:13:57.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I had to meet
the brothers and sisters in person.

00:13:59.188 --> 00:14:02.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew some of the older ones
were a little bit apprehensive

00:14:02.224 --> 00:14:04.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about coming to the meetings,

00:14:04.226 --> 00:14:08.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there they were at the meeting,
loyally attending.

00:14:08.364 --> 00:14:11.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that actually
was a very encouraging experience.

00:14:18.841 --> 00:14:20.843 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Going back to the Kingdom Hall

00:14:20.843 --> 00:14:22.545 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and seeing my brothers and sisters

00:14:22.545 --> 00:14:25.714 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was something so beautiful.

00:14:25.714 --> 00:14:30.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hearing their voices live
and no longer from a computer

00:14:30.352 --> 00:14:34.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seeing their eyes sparkling with joy,
shiny with emotion,

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:38.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made me feel an extraordinary emotion
inside the heart.

00:14:40.696 --> 00:14:44.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has been taking good care
of us through the Governing Body,

00:14:44.199 --> 00:14:46.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now that we got the chance
to experience this,

00:14:46.802 --> 00:14:49.305 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we’re very thankful for the opportunity

00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:51.307 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to serve Jehovah, to meet together.

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:52.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been very, very nice.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:59.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meeting together with brothers and sisters
is what Jehovah God wants.

00:15:01.784 --> 00:15:04.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah created us for that—to be together,

00:15:04.553 --> 00:15:06.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to live in unity.

00:15:08.691 --> 00:15:10.960 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It was an upbuilding experience.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.628 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It was beautiful

00:15:12.628 --> 00:15:14.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it strengthened
the spirit of belonging

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we find only in Jehovah’s people.

00:15:20.703 --> 00:15:25.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s why I can only say,
“Thank you, thank you, thank you, Jehovah!”

00:15:31.814 --> 00:15:34.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that was exciting, wasn’t it?

00:15:34.717 --> 00:15:38.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re like me, I’m sure we’re all anxious

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get back to these in-person meetings.

00:15:41.423 --> 00:15:44.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And based on the results
of this pilot program,

00:15:44.226 --> 00:15:46.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we hope that additional congregations
can be approved

00:15:46.962 --> 00:15:49.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to resume in-person meetings
in the months ahead.

00:15:49.898 --> 00:15:51.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the meantime,

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:55.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can continue to pray
for Jehovah’s guidance

00:15:55.404 --> 00:15:58.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and blessing on these arrangements.

00:15:58.907 --> 00:16:01.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, dear friends,

00:16:01.043 --> 00:16:05.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s keep focusing our eyes
on “the One who is invisible,”

00:16:05.648 --> 00:16:08.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trusting that our God loves us 

00:16:08.517 --> 00:16:12.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he will never allow
his people to come to harm.

00:16:12.254 --> 00:16:16.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May Jehovah continue to bless you all richly!

00:16:16.291 --> 00:16:18.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:16:18.694 --> 00:16:22.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
