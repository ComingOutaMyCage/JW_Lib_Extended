In this update, I’d like to talk with you

00:00:04.154 --> 00:00:06.956 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about something very close to my heart

00:00:06.956 --> 00:00:08.291 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—Bethel.

00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:10.660 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When I learned the truth as a teenager,

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I made Bethel service a goal.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After I was baptized,
I pioneered for two years

00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:19.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then I came to Bethel.

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:22.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’ve been here for 36 years now.

00:00:22.172 --> 00:00:26.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I’m happy to talk to you
about how things are going at Bethel

00:00:26.543 --> 00:00:30.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how the worldwide Bethel family
is coping with the pandemic.

00:00:31.915 --> 00:00:33.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt you’ll be encouraged to hear

00:00:33.983 --> 00:00:37.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what helps them to remain joyful
in their service.

00:00:37.487 --> 00:00:40.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of you have expressed appreciation,

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
saying that during this pandemic,

00:00:42.692 --> 00:00:46.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have continued to receive spiritual food.

00:00:46.196 --> 00:00:48.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This includes our weekly meetings,

00:00:48.498 --> 00:00:51.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
news articles on jw.org,

00:00:51.701 --> 00:00:55.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
new publications, monthly broadcasts,

00:00:55.238 --> 00:00:58.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
convention programs, and more.

00:00:58.541 --> 00:01:02.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of this is possible
because of the willing spirit

00:01:02.178 --> 00:01:04.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hard work of our Bethel family

00:01:04.781 --> 00:01:08.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under challenging circumstances.

00:01:08.118 --> 00:01:12.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Around the world, the Bethel family
has been sheltering in place,

00:01:12.756 --> 00:01:15.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in most cases, for about one year.

00:01:15.925 --> 00:01:18.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our Bethelites have sacrificed opportunities

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:22.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to spend time in person
with family and dear friends,

00:01:22.732 --> 00:01:26.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’ve done this
with a cooperative and willing spirit.

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:28.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:31.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because they love Jehovah and Jesus,

00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:33.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and because they love you.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They want to serve the needs
of our worldwide brotherhood.

00:01:38.548 --> 00:01:40.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s been a sacrifice for them,

00:01:40.884 --> 00:01:44.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we know that’s also been
a sacrifice for all of you

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have family and friends at Bethel

00:01:47.223 --> 00:01:49.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you haven’t been able
to see them in person

00:01:49.926 --> 00:01:52.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during these difficult times.

00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:56.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a sense, you’ve made
a contribution to the work

00:01:56.432 --> 00:01:59.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by helping members of your family
who are at Bethel

00:01:59.636 --> 00:02:03.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to stay and concentrate
on their work.

00:02:03.406 --> 00:02:07.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful gift your support has been!

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, when this all began,

00:02:10.113 --> 00:02:14.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
few imagined it would stretch on for so long.

00:02:14.083 --> 00:02:16.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video,

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:20.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll see what some
of our hardworking Bethelites have been doing

00:02:20.156 --> 00:02:22.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to maintain their joy

00:02:22.158 --> 00:02:26.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and keep the Kingdom work going
without interruption.

00:02:27.597 --> 00:02:29.566 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Three things that I miss are traveling,

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:31.267 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
playing sports,

00:02:31.267 --> 00:02:32.869 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and taco stands.

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:35.605 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I really miss my family.

00:02:35.605 --> 00:02:38.341 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, as I’m living on my own,

00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:40.176 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the most difficult thing for me

00:02:40.176 --> 00:02:42.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that I miss the brothers.

00:02:42.011 --> 00:02:45.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t have as much contact with them
as I did before.

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:49.786 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Most of all, I miss my two young nieces.

00:02:49.786 --> 00:02:52.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am very close to them.

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:54.624 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I really miss hugging the sisters

00:02:54.624 --> 00:02:56.993 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the kids in the congregation.

00:02:56.993 --> 00:02:59.762 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Everything changed overnight

00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:01.464 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and very suddenly.

00:03:01.464 --> 00:03:04.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers from outside Bethel
who came to help us with the recordings

00:03:04.801 --> 00:03:08.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could not do this anymore,
so the work increased considerably,

00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:11.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially for the regional convention.

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:14.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had more work than ever.

00:03:14.077 --> 00:03:17.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right before the pandemic,
I was assigned to a new branch.

00:03:17.714 --> 00:03:20.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means learning a brand-new culture

00:03:20.483 --> 00:03:23.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and starting again, developing friendships.

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:26.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t feel as busy as before

00:03:26.723 --> 00:03:29.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or as busy as I would have liked
to have been.

00:03:29.158 --> 00:03:33.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I have to admit,
I sometimes have the feeling

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:37.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I’m just not as useful as I was before.

00:03:39.903 --> 00:03:44.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My dad had to be admitted to a hospital
because he became very ill,

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I felt helpless and guilty

00:03:46.676 --> 00:03:49.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I couldn’t do
what I really wanted to do

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to be with my family.

00:03:52.615 --> 00:03:56.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because we live in an apartment
right in the city center,

00:03:56.185 --> 00:03:58.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can’t go out.

00:03:58.221 --> 00:04:02.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you’re lonely
and trapped inside four walls,

00:04:02.091 --> 00:04:05.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s very easy to get lost
in negative thoughts.

00:04:06.362 --> 00:04:07.530 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I like to think

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.066 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about the Biblical example of Joseph.

00:04:10.066 --> 00:04:12.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did not concentrate

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the negative aspects of his situation,

00:04:15.605 --> 00:04:18.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, rather, he always thought
of doing his best

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:20.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all the assignments he was given.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, the Bible has helped me a lot.

00:04:23.446 --> 00:04:27.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think about Bible texts
such as Psalm 94:18, 19,

00:04:27.617 --> 00:04:29.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it says:

00:04:29.118 --> 00:04:32.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Your loyal love, O Jehovah,
kept supporting me.

00:04:32.455 --> 00:04:36.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When anxieties overwhelmed me,
you comforted and soothed me.”

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:38.361 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Thinking about the Paradise,

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:40.263 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I picture myself with my Mom

00:04:40.263 --> 00:04:42.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my sister Carol,
walking along the beach

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:45.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and watching a beautiful sunset.

00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:48.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll have all eternity to be together.

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:50.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do exercise every day,

00:04:50.907 --> 00:04:54.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I also connect with the congregation
for the preaching work.

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:58.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Increasing the time I spend
in the preaching work

00:04:58.147 --> 00:05:01.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has allowed me to focus
on helping other people.

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:05.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Auxiliary pioneering has been
my window into the world outside.

00:05:05.488 --> 00:05:09.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When my friends and family ask me
how I’m doing, I tell them that I’m OK.

00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:12.562 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We don’t try to paint an unrealistic picture

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:13.863 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that all is fine

00:05:13.863 --> 00:05:15.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that there are no challenges,

00:05:15.698 --> 00:05:17.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we try always to be positive.

00:05:17.934 --> 00:05:20.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife and I tell them to remain calm

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because at Bethel, they take good care of us.

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they still know that it’s not easy.

00:05:25.508 --> 00:05:28.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And every time
I see them smile in a video call,

00:05:28.478 --> 00:05:32.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s as if they were giving my heart
a big hug.

00:05:32.281 --> 00:05:36.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, by doing practical things
for our parents,

00:05:36.352 --> 00:05:39.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for example, we would connect with them

00:05:39.355 --> 00:05:41.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and read the daily text together.

00:05:41.524 --> 00:05:44.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being at Bethel during the pandemic
is a great privilege

00:05:44.794 --> 00:05:48.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it gives me the circumstances
to be a source of encouragement

00:05:48.464 --> 00:05:51.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those at Bethel
who are going through a rough time

00:05:51.334 --> 00:05:55.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but especially for the friends who are out
in the front lines of this battle.

00:05:55.104 --> 00:05:58.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being at Bethel makes me feel
deeply indebted to Jehovah.

00:05:58.841 --> 00:06:03.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s been taking care of us
spiritually, emotionally, and physically.

00:06:03.646 --> 00:06:07.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we are here serving at Bethel

00:06:07.283 --> 00:06:12.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(as it has been said) as the “supply line”
to support the brothers.

00:06:14.957 --> 00:06:18.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m doing this
at the most crucial moment of history.

00:06:18.361 --> 00:06:21.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m seeing all of this up close.

00:06:21.697 --> 00:06:26.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why every sacrifice I make
for this privilege is worth it.

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We deeply appreciate our Bethelites

00:06:32.341 --> 00:06:35.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with their families
and their congregations

00:06:35.278 --> 00:06:40.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all the sacrifices they’re making
in support of the Kingdom work.

00:06:40.183 --> 00:06:45.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We keep all of you dear brothers and sisters
in our prayers.

00:06:45.054 --> 00:06:47.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you saw from the video,

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like you, our Bethelites
deal with anxieties during the pandemic.

00:06:52.228 --> 00:06:54.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s normal to have these feelings.

00:06:54.964 --> 00:06:59.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that the trials
that we’re experiencing are going to end.

00:06:59.135 --> 00:07:04.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in the meantime, we’re dealing
with very real human emotions.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what can we do to cope?

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:10.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, be honest about it with Jehovah

00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:13.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and express to him what you’re dealing with.

00:07:13.583 --> 00:07:17.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When David prayed to Jehovah
in a time of crisis,

00:07:17.053 --> 00:07:21.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said at Psalm 142:2:

00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:25.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Before him I pour out my concern;

00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:29.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before him I tell about my distress.”

00:07:30.833 --> 00:07:33.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can do the same.

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:37.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pour out your concerns and anxieties
to Jehovah.

00:07:37.006 --> 00:07:41.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He promises to help us cope if we have faith.

00:07:41.177 --> 00:07:43.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray for faith each day.

00:07:43.813 --> 00:07:46.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Along with this, keep in mind

00:07:46.182 --> 00:07:49.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that today’s problems are only temporary.

00:07:49.485 --> 00:07:51.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The last days had a beginning,

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:54.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the last days will have an end.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This pandemic had a beginning,

00:07:56.459 --> 00:08:00.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this pandemic will have an end.

00:08:00.163 --> 00:08:04.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul called such trials
“momentary.”

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is the case even more so

00:08:06.602 --> 00:08:10.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we move toward the end
of this system of things.

00:08:10.806 --> 00:08:15.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 2 Corinthians 4:17, 18, he said:

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:19.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For though the tribulation
is momentary and light,

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:21.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it works out for us a glory

00:08:21.984 --> 00:08:25.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that is of more and more
surpassing greatness

00:08:25.188 --> 00:08:27.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and is everlasting;

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“while we keep our eyes,

00:08:29.292 --> 00:08:30.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not on the things seen,

00:08:30.993 --> 00:08:33.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but on the things unseen.

00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:35.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the things seen are temporary,

00:08:35.698 --> 00:08:39.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the things unseen are everlasting.”

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:44.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That inspired advice
benefited the early Christians,

00:08:44.207 --> 00:08:48.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it can benefit all of God’s people today.

00:08:48.544 --> 00:08:52.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We commend all of you
for your faithful endurance

00:08:52.081 --> 00:08:55.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for remaining busy
in your service to Jehovah.

00:08:55.851 --> 00:09:00.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through your efforts
along with the power of Jehovah’s spirit

00:09:00.723 --> 00:09:03.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only has the Kingdom work continued

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:08.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s also moving forward
and expanding in exciting ways.

00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:10.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One example of that

00:09:10.433 --> 00:09:14.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the world headquarters project
at Ramapo, New York,

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:18.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
announced at the 2019 annual meeting.

00:09:18.207 --> 00:09:21.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you been wondering
how the Ramapo project

00:09:21.143 --> 00:09:24.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been affected by the pandemic?

00:09:24.046 --> 00:09:28.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re happy to share
this behind-the-scenes report

00:09:28.451 --> 00:09:31.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on how things have been progressing.

00:09:38.894 --> 00:09:42.265 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
On the January 2020 monthly broadcast,

00:09:42.265 --> 00:09:44.767 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
our brothers around the world learned

00:09:44.767 --> 00:09:47.737 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that the Governing Body had determined

00:09:47.737 --> 00:09:50.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was Jehovah’s direction

00:09:50.273 --> 00:09:53.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and approval had been given
for a site dedicated primarily

00:09:53.876 --> 00:09:57.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to media production in Ramapo.

00:09:57.847 --> 00:10:00.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, just three months later,

00:10:00.816 --> 00:10:04.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a once-in-a-generation event, COVID-19,

00:10:04.587 --> 00:10:06.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brought grinding to a halt

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:10.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the plans that large institutions,
even nations,

00:10:10.626 --> 00:10:12.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had in mind.

00:10:12.628 --> 00:10:15.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How were the plans for Ramapo affected?

00:10:15.298 --> 00:10:18.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was it really the right time
for Jehovah’s organization

00:10:18.534 --> 00:10:22.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to start a major construction project?

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:25.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we review the events of 2020, look out

00:10:25.975 --> 00:10:30.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only for clear evidence
of Jehovah’s direction and blessing

00:10:30.346 --> 00:10:34.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also the conclusion that Job once came to

00:10:34.583 --> 00:10:36.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he said to Jehovah,

00:10:36.752 --> 00:10:40.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Nothing you have in mind
is impossible for you to do.’

00:10:41.691 --> 00:10:43.326 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
For a period here in New York,

00:10:43.326 --> 00:10:45.328 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
nonessential construction activities

00:10:45.328 --> 00:10:46.796 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were restricted.

00:10:46.796 --> 00:10:49.098 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
However, at the exact time

00:10:49.098 --> 00:10:51.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our project schedule required it,

00:10:51.334 --> 00:10:54.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the town of Ramapo started holding
town board meetings

00:10:54.303 --> 00:10:57.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over (you guessed it) Zoom.

00:10:57.573 --> 00:11:02.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That meant that even though we were
in the midst of the unfolding global chaos,

00:11:02.345 --> 00:11:06.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were still able to meet a milestone
on July 8, 2020,

00:11:06.849 --> 00:11:09.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we had our first project meeting
with the town board.

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:13.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we have clearly seen Jehovah’s blessing

00:11:13.956 --> 00:11:16.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the meetings we have had with them
since then.

00:11:17.693 --> 00:11:19.195 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We hit a second

00:11:19.195 --> 00:11:21.630 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and much more significant milestone

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:24.266 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on December 9, 2020,

00:11:24.266 --> 00:11:26.335 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when the town approved

00:11:26.335 --> 00:11:28.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our scoping document.

00:11:28.371 --> 00:11:31.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like the homework a teacher assigns a student

00:11:31.707 --> 00:11:33.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to pass an important grade,

00:11:33.976 --> 00:11:37.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we now know the information
we should provide the town

00:11:37.546 --> 00:11:41.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to obtain permission
to start construction.

00:11:41.283 --> 00:11:42.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When will that be?

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:47.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Currently, we are on course
for the end of 2021.

00:11:47.623 --> 00:11:52.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is a number of months earlier
than had originally been planned for,

00:11:52.461 --> 00:11:55.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even before the pandemic.

00:11:55.097 --> 00:11:57.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So just as Job said,

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:01.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Nothing Jehovah has in mind is impossible.’

00:12:03.839 --> 00:12:06.375 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Since April 2019,

00:12:06.375 --> 00:12:08.177 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when the Construction Project Committee

00:12:08.177 --> 00:12:09.712 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was appointed,

00:12:09.712 --> 00:12:13.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the design of the site
and the first buildings to be constructed

00:12:13.416 --> 00:12:16.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has advanced tremendously.

00:12:16.218 --> 00:12:20.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many key lessons taken
from recent large projects

00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:22.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have influenced the direction

00:12:22.191 --> 00:12:25.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Worldwide
Design/Construction Department,

00:12:25.094 --> 00:12:27.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under the direction
of the Publishing Committee,

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have given.

00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:33.836 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The Ramapo site is 249 acres.

00:12:33.836 --> 00:12:36.572 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The buildings are about 160 feet

00:12:36.572 --> 00:12:38.641 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
above Sterling Mine Road.

00:12:38.641 --> 00:12:41.510 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The primary interests off Sterling Mine Road

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:43.913 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
bring you first to the visitors’ center,

00:12:43.913 --> 00:12:45.247 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
which will accommodate

00:12:45.247 --> 00:12:49.185 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
1,200 visitors per day.

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:52.354 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The studio building with its soundstages

00:12:52.354 --> 00:12:54.924 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is in the center of the site

00:12:54.924 --> 00:12:59.628 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and adjacent to the studios are workshops.

00:12:59.628 --> 00:13:02.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over the ridgeline is the back lot

00:13:02.898 --> 00:13:07.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for outdoor sets and filming.

00:13:07.002 --> 00:13:11.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next to the studios are the offices,

00:13:11.607 --> 00:13:13.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reception,

00:13:13.342 --> 00:13:15.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the events building.

00:13:15.511 --> 00:13:17.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This building can be configured

00:13:17.246 --> 00:13:19.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as either a large assembly space

00:13:19.782 --> 00:13:22.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for 1,300 attendees,

00:13:22.718 --> 00:13:25.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a large dining room for 1,200 people,

00:13:25.821 --> 00:13:29.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or some yet-to-be-defined function.

00:13:29.458 --> 00:13:32.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the west of the site are residences

00:13:32.595 --> 00:13:36.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for 1,290 volunteers.

00:13:37.666 --> 00:13:40.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Much time and energy have been invested

00:13:40.369 --> 00:13:44.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the research
of the best energy options for the site.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:47.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This led to the decision to use electricity

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:50.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the primary energy source.

00:13:50.179 --> 00:13:54.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A vast geothermal well field
located beneath the studios

00:13:54.617 --> 00:13:58.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will heat and cool the entire complex,

00:13:58.087 --> 00:14:00.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 120,000 square feet

00:14:00.689 --> 00:14:02.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of photovoltaic panels

00:14:02.424 --> 00:14:04.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will create electricity,

00:14:04.426 --> 00:14:06.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is then stored

00:14:06.228 --> 00:14:09.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in an industrial-grade battery bank

00:14:09.131 --> 00:14:11.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and can thus be used at any time.

00:14:11.934 --> 00:14:16.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The result is that the site
has its own microgrid

00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:20.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the ability to make, to store,

00:14:20.142 --> 00:14:22.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then to redirect energy

00:14:22.311 --> 00:14:24.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
around the site where it is needed.

00:14:25.514 --> 00:14:27.283 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Many of us who generally work

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:28.884 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in an office environment

00:14:28.884 --> 00:14:30.653 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
have gotten used to working from home

00:14:30.653 --> 00:14:32.321 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
during the pandemic.

00:14:32.321 --> 00:14:36.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will that affect the need for office space
on the Ramapo project?

00:14:36.258 --> 00:14:38.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Frankly, it’s impossible to predict

00:14:38.727 --> 00:14:42.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what the configuration of office space
will be in the future.

00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:46.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, flexibility in the layout
of future office space

00:14:46.068 --> 00:14:48.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the most important design criteria.

00:14:48.904 --> 00:14:50.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The building is divided

00:14:50.439 --> 00:14:53.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into 10-foot by 15-foot modules.

00:14:53.142 --> 00:14:55.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each module has a ceiling cloud above it

00:14:55.844 --> 00:14:59.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
containing a heating and cooling unit
and lighting.

00:14:59.448 --> 00:15:01.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Power and data wiring are in a raised floor

00:15:01.917 --> 00:15:04.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to allow for a variety of configurations

00:15:04.253 --> 00:15:06.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reconfigurations.

00:15:06.255 --> 00:15:09.124 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Demountable partitions extend from the floor

00:15:09.124 --> 00:15:10.726 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to the deck above.

00:15:10.726 --> 00:15:12.828 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They can transform one module

00:15:12.828 --> 00:15:14.463 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
into a single office

00:15:14.463 --> 00:15:16.765 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or small conference room.

00:15:16.765 --> 00:15:19.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Partitions can group several modules together

00:15:19.468 --> 00:15:21.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to form a larger conference room,

00:15:21.236 --> 00:15:23.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the floor can be free of partitions

00:15:23.872 --> 00:15:26.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to work as an open-plan work area.

00:15:26.976 --> 00:15:28.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More important,

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as these demountable partitions
have no services in them,

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these changes can be made at any time before

00:15:34.717 --> 00:15:37.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or after moving into the facility,

00:15:37.219 --> 00:15:40.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as office needs are better understood.

00:15:40.356 --> 00:15:42.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maximizing the glass on the facades

00:15:42.825 --> 00:15:45.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then the use of glass partitions
inside the offices

00:15:45.995 --> 00:15:49.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ensures that all offices
have plenty of natural light.

00:15:52.601 --> 00:15:55.337 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The ten residence buildings are oriented

00:15:55.337 --> 00:15:57.973 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in a north-south direction

00:15:57.973 --> 00:15:59.975 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so that all rooms will have

00:15:59.975 --> 00:16:03.879 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
either morning or afternoon sun.

00:16:03.879 --> 00:16:07.249 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They are clustered around existing wetlands.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:10.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Careful research led to the decision

00:16:10.285 --> 00:16:13.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pursue a different structural system

00:16:13.522 --> 00:16:16.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
known as mass timber

00:16:16.525 --> 00:16:20.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—something we’ve not done
on previous projects of this scale.

00:16:20.929 --> 00:16:25.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Timber is bonded
in crossed directional layers

00:16:25.534 --> 00:16:29.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to form the structural elements
of the building.

00:16:29.171 --> 00:16:32.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is an increasingly familiar system.

00:16:32.041 --> 00:16:34.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Robust and safe

00:16:34.043 --> 00:16:37.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that means that the beams,
the columns, and the floors

00:16:37.346 --> 00:16:41.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be prefabricated off-site,

00:16:41.216 --> 00:16:43.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making the structure of the building

00:16:43.218 --> 00:16:45.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faster to put up.

00:16:45.254 --> 00:16:50.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And apart from being economical, time-saving,

00:16:50.025 --> 00:16:53.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reducing the carbon footprint
of the project,

00:16:53.429 --> 00:16:56.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it should also make
for some very attractive buildings.

00:17:01.503 --> 00:17:03.238 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
As many filming

00:17:03.238 --> 00:17:04.907 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and recording projects

00:17:04.907 --> 00:17:08.377 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
will be produced at the new Ramapo facility,

00:17:08.377 --> 00:17:12.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
50 rooms in the residence building
closest to the center of the site

00:17:12.648 --> 00:17:16.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been designed
to be smaller hotellike rooms

00:17:16.919 --> 00:17:19.021 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that will allow for comfortable

00:17:19.021 --> 00:17:20.255 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
short-term stays

00:17:20.255 --> 00:17:22.391 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for those here to assist

00:17:22.391 --> 00:17:23.792 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
as cast members

00:17:23.792 --> 00:17:25.828 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or other visitors.

00:17:26.929 --> 00:17:30.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As mentioned, many have worked
from home during the pandemic,

00:17:30.165 --> 00:17:32.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some prefer it.

00:17:32.768 --> 00:17:35.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will it be the wave of the future?

00:17:35.671 --> 00:17:37.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We cannot say.

00:17:37.339 --> 00:17:40.442 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
However, the majority of the residence rooms

00:17:40.442 --> 00:17:42.311 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
will have a separate room

00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:43.879 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—many with a window—

00:17:43.879 --> 00:17:45.247 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that can be used

00:17:45.247 --> 00:17:47.149 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
either as an additional storage room

00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:49.218 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or home office.

00:17:50.152 --> 00:17:54.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Future updates will feature
the central focus of this new facility

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:58.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the new AVS studios building.

00:17:58.393 --> 00:18:01.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although it will be the biggest
we have ever constructed,

00:18:01.363 --> 00:18:03.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more important,

00:18:03.365 --> 00:18:07.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will bring what is presently done
in many different areas

00:18:07.202 --> 00:18:10.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and, of course,
our hardworking brothers and sisters—

00:18:10.806 --> 00:18:12.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all under one roof.

00:18:13.809 --> 00:18:17.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite a number of challenges in 2020,

00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:21.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Ramapo project kept moving forward.

00:18:21.216 --> 00:18:24.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we look ahead, we eagerly await

00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:26.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even further evidence

00:18:26.421 --> 00:18:29.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that nothing Jehovah has in mind

00:18:29.124 --> 00:18:31.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is impossible for him to do.

00:18:44.706 --> 00:18:48.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The amazing progress we’re making
with Ramapo

00:18:48.076 --> 00:18:51.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even in the middle
of such challenging circumstances—

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reminds us of Psalm chapter 127

00:18:54.883 --> 00:18:57.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 1:

00:18:57.085 --> 00:19:00.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Unless Jehovah builds the house,

00:19:00.088 --> 00:19:03.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is in vain that its builders
work hard on it.”

00:19:04.827 --> 00:19:07.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no doubt that Jehovah is helping us

00:19:07.729 --> 00:19:10.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[build] the house” at Ramapo!

00:19:10.732 --> 00:19:14.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may have noted
that the video mentioned future updates.

00:19:14.603 --> 00:19:17.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, in time, you can look forward

00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:20.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to more reports about the Ramapo project.

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:25.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we reflect on all
that’s been accomplished this past year,

00:19:25.547 --> 00:19:27.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s clear that Jehovah is blessing

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:32.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the self-sacrifice
of our worldwide Bethel family.

00:19:32.321 --> 00:19:37.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re like the ones described
at Psalm 110:3,

00:19:37.259 --> 00:19:39.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it says:

00:19:39.361 --> 00:19:44.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Your people
will offer themselves willingly.”

00:19:44.099 --> 00:19:46.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These brothers and sisters

00:19:46.335 --> 00:19:50.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are truly “[offering] themselves willingly”
to Jehovah

00:19:50.038 --> 00:19:52.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
day after day.

00:19:52.074 --> 00:19:55.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So please keep the Bethel family

00:19:55.177 --> 00:19:58.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Ramapo project in your prayers.

00:19:58.881 --> 00:20:02.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re confident that Jehovah
will bless your hard work

00:20:02.818 --> 00:20:05.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your endurance during this pandemic,

00:20:05.554 --> 00:20:09.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether you’re serving
in Bethel or in the field.

00:20:09.324 --> 00:20:12.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that you’ll show the same zeal

00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:16.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the campaign
to invite as many as possible

00:20:16.031 --> 00:20:20.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the special talk
and Memorial of Christ’s death.

00:20:20.702 --> 00:20:22.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s our earnest prayer

00:20:22.871 --> 00:20:26.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah continue to guide
and strengthen you

00:20:26.174 --> 00:20:28.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the days ahead.

00:20:28.343 --> 00:20:32.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
