At Romans 8:35, the apostle Paul asked:

00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:08.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who will separate us

00:00:08.825 --> 00:00:10.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from the love of the Christ?

00:00:10.827 --> 00:00:15.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Will tribulation or distress or persecution

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:20.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or hunger or nakedness or danger or sword?”

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how Paul answered
that question in verse 37:

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:29.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On the contrary, in all these things

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we are coming off completely victorious

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:34.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the one who loved us.”

00:00:35.585 --> 00:00:37.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a very fitting scripture

00:00:37.854 --> 00:00:39.556 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for this update.

00:00:39.556 --> 00:00:42.058 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Many of the things Paul mentioned

00:00:42.058 --> 00:00:45.729 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we’ve experienced in the past year.

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:48.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There have been many challenges.

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:51.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, through the help
we receive from Jehovah,

00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:55.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we are coming off . . . victorious.”

00:00:55.638 --> 00:00:59.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we’re all contending
with the pandemic.

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:02.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s organization has been complying

00:01:02.178 --> 00:01:06.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with guidance
from public health officials worldwide.

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:09.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve worked hard as an organization

00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:13.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show deep respect
for the sanctity of life.

00:01:13.356 --> 00:01:16.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ve watched Jehovah
bless these efforts

00:01:16.392 --> 00:01:21.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as our meetings and ministry have thrived.

00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:24.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, we are not immune

00:01:24.768 --> 00:01:26.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the effects of the virus.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As of May 15, we have now lost

00:01:31.074 --> 00:01:34.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over 17,000

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our dear brothers and sisters

00:01:36.446 --> 00:01:39.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to COVID-19.

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:43.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt most of us
have lost someone we love.

00:01:43.653 --> 00:01:47.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How comforting to know that our loved ones

00:01:47.123 --> 00:01:50.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are safe in Jehovah’s memory!

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even death has not separated them
from Jehovah.

00:01:56.666 --> 00:01:59.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There have been many recent news reports

00:01:59.702 --> 00:02:03.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the pandemic in India and Brazil.

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:07.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of you have been asking
how our brothers there are doing.

00:02:07.343 --> 00:02:09.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the past month in India,

00:02:09.946 --> 00:02:12.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there have been ten times

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:17.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as many new cases and deaths
among the brothers

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than there were in the previous month.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The disaster relief committees

00:02:22.358 --> 00:02:25.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are actively monitoring
the needs of our brothers

00:02:25.695 --> 00:02:29.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, as needed, helping them locate hospitals

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:32.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have available beds.

00:02:32.168 --> 00:02:35.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Brazil, the number of cases

00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:38.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the number of deaths continue to be high.

00:02:38.441 --> 00:02:43.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, over 400 of our brothers in Brazil

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:47.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have died from the virus
in just the past month.

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:50.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The responsible brothers are working hard

00:02:50.787 --> 00:02:53.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help our brothers in these lands.

00:02:53.756 --> 00:02:56.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please keep all of our brothers

00:02:56.993 --> 00:03:00.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in India and Brazil in your prayers.

00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:05.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In various parts of the world,
the virus is resurging

00:03:05.802 --> 00:03:08.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in some cases because of new variants.

00:03:08.538 --> 00:03:13.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, this pandemic is not over.

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please continue to be careful.

00:03:16.713 --> 00:03:18.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may find it helpful to review

00:03:18.982 --> 00:03:23.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the <i>2020 Governing Body Update #9</i>,

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which explains how COVID-19 spreads

00:03:26.522 --> 00:03:30.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what we can do to protect ourselves.

00:03:30.827 --> 00:03:34.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is our view on vaccination?

00:03:34.731 --> 00:03:39.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses
are not against vaccination.

00:03:39.435 --> 00:03:42.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We view it as a personal decision

00:03:42.171 --> 00:03:44.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for each Christian to make.

00:03:44.774 --> 00:03:49.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Already, in cooperation
with public health officials,

00:03:49.012 --> 00:03:54.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many in our Bethel families
have chosen to be vaccinated.

00:03:55.418 --> 00:03:58.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2020, we also faced

00:03:58.087 --> 00:04:02.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an unprecedented number of natural disasters.

00:04:02.258 --> 00:04:06.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine that in the 2020 service year

00:04:06.195 --> 00:04:10.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have had 204 disasters?

00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:13.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s more than double the number
of disasters

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we had in 2018!

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we’ve had to cope
with many disasters during the pandemic.

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:24.580 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Let me remind you of some of them.

00:04:25.281 --> 00:04:28.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Central America was struck by Hurricane Eta.

00:04:29.619 --> 00:04:32.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
St. Vincent has had volcanic eruptions.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Croatia was shaken by earthquakes.

00:04:37.727 --> 00:04:41.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lebanon was devastated by an explosion.

00:04:42.165 --> 00:04:45.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nigeria suffered widespread flooding.

00:04:45.802 --> 00:04:49.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mozambique was hit by Cyclone Eloise.

00:04:49.806 --> 00:04:51.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Philippines was pummeled

00:04:51.808 --> 00:04:53.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Super Typhoon Goni.

00:04:54.477 --> 00:04:57.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Australia had destructive bush fires.

00:04:58.348 --> 00:04:59.916 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
These are just a few

00:04:59.916 --> 00:05:01.517 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the disasters we have faced

00:05:01.517 --> 00:05:03.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the pandemic.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is exactly what Paul was talking about

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he mentioned tribulation, distress,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hunger, nakedness, danger, or sword.

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:18.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would any of these things

00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:22.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“be able to separate us from God’s love”?

00:05:22.372 --> 00:05:24.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What have we seen?

00:05:24.674 --> 00:05:29.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s hear some expressions
from our brothers in the United States.

00:05:35.051 --> 00:05:36.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you have a disaster

00:05:36.652 --> 00:05:38.554 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on top of a disaster,

00:05:38.554 --> 00:05:41.391 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
COVID-19 on top of Hurricane Sally,

00:05:41.391 --> 00:05:44.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s a challenge to get through
and navigate both.

00:05:45.928 --> 00:05:48.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being homebound for so many months,

00:05:48.064 --> 00:05:49.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everybody was already feeling

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:52.101 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a little bit on edge.

00:05:52.101 --> 00:05:55.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then you add the stress
of the flood on top of it.

00:05:56.305 --> 00:05:58.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The speed of the brothers

00:05:58.074 --> 00:05:59.375 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and sisters responding

00:05:59.375 --> 00:06:02.979 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was probably the most heartwarming.

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:07.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We called them on a Wednesday
to start some of their work on Friday,

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and by Friday, they were organized
and ready to go.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think it’s one of the most heartwarming

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:15.525 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
privileges I’ve ever seen

00:06:15.525 --> 00:06:17.894 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—how Jehovah’s organization

00:06:17.894 --> 00:06:20.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can take care of needs,

00:06:20.363 --> 00:06:22.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whereas the world around us is falling apart.

00:06:25.601 --> 00:06:26.636 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
There are people who think:

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:28.704 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‘I can handle this. I can handle this,’

00:06:28.704 --> 00:06:30.139 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
you know, ‘I can do this.’

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:31.808 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And you can’t do it on your own.

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:33.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You need the friends. You need them.

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:37.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the call goes out,
Jehovah’s people come running.

00:06:37.947 --> 00:06:39.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s an amazing thing to see.

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:43.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no way that Jehovah’s love
can be blocked.

00:06:43.853 --> 00:06:46.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re sheltered in place,
wherever you are,

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:48.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s love gets through.

00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve been through a difficult situation,

00:06:51.727 --> 00:06:53.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but our confidence is solid

00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:55.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he’ll continue to help us.

00:06:55.731 --> 00:06:57.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He got us through this problem;

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:58.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’ll get us through the next.

00:06:59.702 --> 00:07:03.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the reasons why our brothers
are coming off victorious

00:07:03.573 --> 00:07:06.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is because of all of you.

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:09.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have been there to help.

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:13.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of you have risked
your own safety to provide relief.

00:07:13.716 --> 00:07:17.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although most of us
don’t have the circumstances to do that,

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve made donations.

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:23.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result, we’ve been able
to provide our brothers

00:07:23.593 --> 00:07:28.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with food, water,
building materials, and medicine

00:07:28.498 --> 00:07:33.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all because of your generosity and goodness.

00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:36.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for what you’ve done

00:07:36.205 --> 00:07:40.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help our brothers
who face these disasters.

00:07:41.477 --> 00:07:44.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not the only thing
that Paul talked about

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Romans 8:35.

00:07:47.917 --> 00:07:51.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also mentioned persecution.

00:07:51.053 --> 00:07:53.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We certainly have had to face that.

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:56.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It hasn’t gone away during the pandemic.

00:07:56.859 --> 00:07:59.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As of May 2021,

00:07:59.128 --> 00:08:02.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than 155 brothers and sisters

00:08:02.832 --> 00:08:06.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are in prison for their faith.

00:08:06.035 --> 00:08:10.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even so, there have been
positive developments.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In recent months,
we were so encouraged to learn

00:08:15.144 --> 00:08:18.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that 32 of our brothers in Eritrea

00:08:18.814 --> 00:08:20.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been set free,

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:24.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including Paulos, Isaac, and Negede,

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:28.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were imprisoned for 26 years.

00:08:28.391 --> 00:08:30.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We continue to pray

00:08:30.393 --> 00:08:34.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the 20 brothers and sisters
who are still in prison.

00:08:36.332 --> 00:08:39.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On May 8, we were delighted to learn

00:08:39.068 --> 00:08:42.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Turkmenistan government
released from prison

00:08:42.538 --> 00:08:44.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all 16 of our brothers

00:08:44.974 --> 00:08:46.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were imprisoned

00:08:46.209 --> 00:08:48.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for conscientious objection

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to military service.

00:08:50.213 --> 00:08:52.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thank Jehovah

00:08:52.348 --> 00:08:54.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for these positive developments.

00:08:56.085 --> 00:09:01.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I went to Russia
for the Supreme Court hearings in 2017,

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was a very sobering moment

00:09:04.727 --> 00:09:07.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we heard the judge announce

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:11.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our legal entities were banned.

00:09:11.334 --> 00:09:14.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We knew Jehovah would look
after our brothers,

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:17.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there were so many unknowns.

00:09:17.306 --> 00:09:20.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would our brothers be affected?

00:09:20.676 --> 00:09:25.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some, of course, have been arrested,
like Brother Dennis Christensen.

00:09:25.248 --> 00:09:28.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s been in prison for four years

00:09:28.284 --> 00:09:31.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as of May 25, 2021.

00:09:31.887 --> 00:09:36.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although Dennis has qualified for parole
for over a year,

00:09:36.192 --> 00:09:39.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the authorities have “hardened their hearts.”

00:09:39.128 --> 00:09:42.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have not let him go.

00:09:42.098 --> 00:09:44.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In spite of that,

00:09:44.433 --> 00:09:47.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dennis and his wife, Irina,
are in good spirits.

00:09:49.105 --> 00:09:51.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we continue to remember our 10 brothers

00:09:51.941 --> 00:09:54.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are in penal colonies in Russia

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:58.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the 48 who are in pretrial detention

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as of May 14, 2021.

00:10:02.451 --> 00:10:06.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now that four years
have passed since the ban,

00:10:06.188 --> 00:10:08.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what do we see?

00:10:08.424 --> 00:10:11.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers have not cowered.

00:10:11.394 --> 00:10:13.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have not backed down.

00:10:13.796 --> 00:10:17.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They continue to serve Jehovah faithfully.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch this next video,

00:10:20.136 --> 00:10:24.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see who the authorities are attacking now.

00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:30.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2013,

00:10:30.746 --> 00:10:32.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our son, Igor, became ill,

00:10:32.715 --> 00:10:36.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he got worse and worse.

00:10:36.185 --> 00:10:39.021 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Then, in 2014, our son died.

00:10:39.021 --> 00:10:41.057 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It was such a tragedy for us,

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:43.526 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and words cannot describe it.

00:10:43.526 --> 00:10:46.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was our only son and was deeply loved.

00:10:46.495 --> 00:10:50.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, two years later, my mother died.

00:10:50.099 --> 00:10:53.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And two years after that, my sister died.

00:10:53.969 --> 00:10:57.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Getting through all of that
was beyond human strength.

00:10:59.241 --> 00:11:03.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had just started to feel a little better

00:11:03.112 --> 00:11:05.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when on March 26,

00:11:05.114 --> 00:11:06.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
2019, . . .

00:11:06.382 --> 00:11:08.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . 2019 . . .

00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:12.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . armed men in masks burst into our home.

00:11:14.657 --> 00:11:17.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was such a shock! We went numb.

00:11:17.493 --> 00:11:19.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We couldn’t say anything.

00:11:19.295 --> 00:11:21.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were paralyzed.

00:11:21.163 --> 00:11:25.568 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
On May 22, 2019,

00:11:25.568 --> 00:11:28.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
early in the morning at 5:45,

00:11:28.637 --> 00:11:31.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the doorbell rang.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I looked through the peephole and saw people

00:11:34.176 --> 00:11:37.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who showed me their identification.

00:11:37.179 --> 00:11:39.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then those people came into my apartment,

00:11:39.849 --> 00:11:42.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made a search, and took me to the center

00:11:42.351 --> 00:11:43.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for fighting extremism.

00:11:45.154 --> 00:11:47.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It ended up with my being accused

00:11:47.857 --> 00:11:51.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of participating in extremist activity.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, in 2020,

00:11:53.529 --> 00:11:57.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the court hearings began for my case.

00:11:58.367 --> 00:12:01.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, for my criminal case,

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:04.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they collected 17 volumes
of evidence against me,

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they questioned over 200 witnesses.

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then the court hearings started.

00:12:09.712 --> 00:12:14.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First of all, there were
Valentina’s hearings, then mine.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, none of that is exactly pleasant,

00:12:16.685 --> 00:12:19.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it somehow made us stronger,

00:12:19.355 --> 00:12:21.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah supported us.

00:12:21.357 --> 00:12:24.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We even went to the court feeling joyful.

00:12:24.059 --> 00:12:27.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We felt that Jehovah
was helping us, supporting us,

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
strengthening us, and encouraging us.

00:12:29.932 --> 00:12:31.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are so grateful to him!

00:12:31.801 --> 00:12:35.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our fellow worshippers
constantly called on us

00:12:35.371 --> 00:12:37.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from all parts of the town.

00:12:37.373 --> 00:12:39.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They always supported us,

00:12:39.375 --> 00:12:42.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
always called us
and said strengthening things

00:12:42.978 --> 00:12:45.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and quotes from the Bible.

00:12:46.882 --> 00:12:50.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I understood that it would end up
with my being a defendant.

00:12:50.619 --> 00:12:54.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was as though inside
I was already prepared for that

00:12:54.557 --> 00:12:57.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, you know,
I didn’t feel any kind of panic.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just wanted to get through it
in a dignified manner

00:13:00.996 --> 00:13:03.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and didn’t want to let anyone down

00:13:03.566 --> 00:13:06.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and under no circumstances

00:13:06.001 --> 00:13:08.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
betray our God, Jehovah.

00:13:08.404 --> 00:13:11.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to say that each day for me

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a blessing from Jehovah.

00:13:14.276 --> 00:13:18.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I pray and ask for peace and calmness

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in both my heart and my home.

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:25.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And right now, the blessings far outweigh

00:13:25.287 --> 00:13:27.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all negative experiences.

00:13:27.456 --> 00:13:29.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This I value very highly.

00:13:29.625 --> 00:13:33.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sentence might even involve
time in prison

00:13:33.429 --> 00:13:36.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or it might be a suspended sentence.

00:13:36.365 --> 00:13:38.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But regardless of the outcome,

00:13:38.534 --> 00:13:40.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to remain faithful to God

00:13:40.903 --> 00:13:42.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to stay on the way of truth

00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:44.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the end.

00:13:45.107 --> 00:13:46.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what happens,

00:13:46.942 --> 00:13:49.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether I remain free

00:13:49.645 --> 00:13:52.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or they put me somewhere behind prison walls,

00:13:52.882 --> 00:13:54.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is absolutely nothing

00:13:54.884 --> 00:13:58.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can “separate us from God’s love.”

00:13:58.087 --> 00:14:01.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No prison walls can shut out God’s love.

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:03.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can penetrate everywhere

00:14:03.893 --> 00:14:05.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to all depths.

00:14:07.396 --> 00:14:10.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the strength that we received from God

00:14:10.499 --> 00:14:13.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that helped us to survive
the death of our son

00:14:13.235 --> 00:14:15.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many other misfortunes,

00:14:15.371 --> 00:14:17.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we will get through this too.

00:14:17.373 --> 00:14:19.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We definitely will!

00:14:19.074 --> 00:14:21.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have no doubt about it.

00:14:26.415 --> 00:14:30.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How shameful
that the authorities are attacking

00:14:30.052 --> 00:14:32.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our elderly brothers and sisters!

00:14:32.888 --> 00:14:36.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, isn’t it amazing

00:14:36.091 --> 00:14:38.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that, despite their own trials,

00:14:38.627 --> 00:14:43.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these dear older ones
are not yielding to fear?

00:14:43.265 --> 00:14:46.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They say that the persecution

00:14:46.068 --> 00:14:49.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has only made them stronger in the faith.

00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:53.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You dear brothers and sisters in Russia

00:14:53.609 --> 00:14:56.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have done so well.

00:14:56.078 --> 00:15:00.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are an inspiration to all of us.

00:15:00.349 --> 00:15:02.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We truly love you.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doesn’t all of this convince us

00:15:07.489 --> 00:15:12.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what Paul said in Romans 8:37?

00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:14.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In all these things

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:18.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we are coming off completely victorious

00:15:18.334 --> 00:15:20.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the one who loved us.”

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:23.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what we’ve seen
with our brothers and sisters

00:15:23.539 --> 00:15:27.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
facing the pandemic, natural disasters,

00:15:27.076 --> 00:15:29.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and persecution.

00:15:29.278 --> 00:15:33.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What conviction does this lead us to?

00:15:33.048 --> 00:15:37.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul continues in verses 38 and 39:

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For I am convinced

00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:43.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that neither death nor life

00:15:43.125 --> 00:15:46.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor angels nor governments

00:15:46.061 --> 00:15:49.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor things now here nor things to come

00:15:49.331 --> 00:15:52.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor powers nor height nor depth

00:15:52.501 --> 00:15:54.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor any other creation

00:15:54.737 --> 00:15:58.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will be able to separate us from God’s love

00:15:58.841 --> 00:16:01.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”

00:16:02.645 --> 00:16:04.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters,
