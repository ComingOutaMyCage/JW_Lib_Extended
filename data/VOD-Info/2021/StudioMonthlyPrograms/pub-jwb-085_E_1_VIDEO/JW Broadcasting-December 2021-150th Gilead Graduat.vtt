We’re delighted you could join us.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome to JW Broadcasting®

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for December 2021!

00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:30.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Watchtower Bible School of Gilead

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.818 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
has now completed 150 classes!

00:00:34.818 --> 00:00:37.554 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This certainly is a theocratic milestone

00:00:37.554 --> 00:00:40.223 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
made possible with Jehovah’s help.

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:45.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This 150th class was a little different.

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:50.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were only 24 students,
which is much less than usual.

00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:55.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because of travel restrictions
based on the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:00:55.505 --> 00:00:58.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all are citizens of the United States.

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:03.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though this group
was different than in years past,

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:05.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the goal remained the same:

00:01:05.715 --> 00:01:09.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to strengthen their faith
so that they can strengthen others

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:12.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wherever they are assigned.

00:01:12.388 --> 00:01:15.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The graduation program helped the students

00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:19.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to focus on key points
they will benefit from on into the future.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please enjoy Part 1 of the graduation

00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:28.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was held
on Saturday, September 11, 2021,

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:30.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the Watchtower Educational Center

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:32.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Patterson, New York!

00:01:33.743 --> 00:01:38.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m going to go back many decades ago

00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:43.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Monday, March 6, 1972.

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:47.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, some of you in the class weren’t alive.

00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:51.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think I know of one for sure who was alive.

00:01:52.495 --> 00:01:56.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s an inside joke, not <i>Inside Story</i>

00:01:57.867 --> 00:01:59.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—but anyway<i>.</i>

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And along with my wife,
we had the privilege

00:02:04.107 --> 00:02:06.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and that was rare
unless you were a Bethelite)

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to attend the graduation

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:11.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.

00:02:11.648 --> 00:02:14.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the 52nd class.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re in the Assembly Hall

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(jam packed there in New York City)

00:02:20.423 --> 00:02:23.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just enjoying it.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a privilege for us to sit there

00:02:26.796 --> 00:02:30.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enjoy that program of the 52nd class!

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now here we are almost 100
(just two shy) classes later

00:02:35.205 --> 00:02:38.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the 150th class.

00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:40.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now we’re grateful

00:02:40.343 --> 00:02:45.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because many are tied in live as we speak.

00:02:45.348 --> 00:02:47.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then the rest of the brotherhood

00:02:47.383 --> 00:02:50.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is going to have it available
in a few months.

00:02:50.887 --> 00:02:54.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So boy, things have changed,
and they enjoy that privilege.

00:02:54.557 --> 00:02:56.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that was a rare privilege.

00:02:56.559 --> 00:03:00.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I remember
Brother Knorr was the chairman

00:03:00.163 --> 00:03:02.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the program.

00:03:02.198 --> 00:03:06.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And certainly, he just loved Gilead.

00:03:06.236 --> 00:03:09.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, that you’ve got to give him.

00:03:09.038 --> 00:03:13.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, Jehovah used him mightily
to get it all started there

00:03:13.376 --> 00:03:15.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1943 was the first one.

00:03:15.378 --> 00:03:20.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But knowing that the beast was coming out,

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah blessed them and said,
‘Yeah, we need a missionary school.’

00:03:24.687 --> 00:03:26.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a missionary school for years.

00:03:26.923 --> 00:03:31.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But anyway, the thing I wanted to mention
is that I remember an outstanding talk.

00:03:31.261 --> 00:03:35.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had heard Brother Fred Franz
the summer before

00:03:35.098 --> 00:03:38.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the Yankee Stadium convention,

00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:41.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we were a little closer there
in the Assembly Hall.

00:03:41.437 --> 00:03:44.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’ll tell you what;
I was just glued to him.

00:03:44.674 --> 00:03:47.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you had the privilege to hear him,
Jehovah blessed—

00:03:47.243 --> 00:03:50.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had a blessed, beautiful mind.

00:03:50.713 --> 00:03:52.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could just quote these scriptures.

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:54.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’ve told folks:

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now, if you don’t pay attention
and stay with him,

00:03:58.087 --> 00:04:00.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you’re going to get lost.

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:01.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s going to lose you.”

00:04:01.257 --> 00:04:04.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you paid attention,
it was thrilling

00:04:04.027 --> 00:04:06.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just to hear him pour out his heart

00:04:06.696 --> 00:04:09.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it was all written
on his figurative heart.

00:04:09.732 --> 00:04:11.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he discussed Ecclesiastes 5.

00:04:11.868 --> 00:04:15.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why I was thinking
of bringing it up for your class here.

00:04:15.905 --> 00:04:18.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because this is really directed to you.

00:04:18.007 --> 00:04:21.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he spoke there about vows.

00:04:21.377 --> 00:04:25.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In those first seven verses,
dreams are mentioned.

00:04:25.615 --> 00:04:30.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I appreciate it because it just struck me
when he mentioned it.

00:04:30.553 --> 00:04:35.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The dreams don’t refer to dreams
one has while they’re sleeping

00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:37.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the busy day.

00:04:37.293 --> 00:04:40.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you can’t get that on your own

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by just reading Ecclesiastes
with whatever version you have.

00:04:44.567 --> 00:04:48.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It had to do with getting sidetracked

00:04:48.171 --> 00:04:50.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with personal pursuits.

00:04:50.606 --> 00:04:53.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These dreams
—these are the things they’re doing.

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:58.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that would be “vanity”
(as we’d said then).

00:04:58.247 --> 00:05:00.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s just take a moment

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:04.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(you here in the class and others
who want to follow along in Ecclesiastes 5)

00:05:04.787 --> 00:05:06.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just touch on some of the nice things.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, you could—

00:05:09.092 --> 00:05:12.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, don’t do it right now,
but you can do it later.

00:05:12.161 --> 00:05:15.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have access to the <i>Research Guide</i>

00:05:15.164 --> 00:05:18.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>—</i>an in-depth understanding

00:05:18.434 --> 00:05:21.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of this wisdom in Ecclesiastes.

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:24.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Brother Franz addressed it.

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:28.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, verse 1 says: “Watch your step.”

00:05:28.077 --> 00:05:32.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is for you soon-to-be graduates.

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:34.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is saying: “Watch your step.”

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t stop doing that.

00:05:36.352 --> 00:05:41.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have thus far,
so continue to “watch your step.”

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he mentions those morally “stupid ones.”

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not you.

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:49.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can avoid that.

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:52.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then I love this in verse 2:

00:05:52.702 --> 00:05:55.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be quick with your mouth.”

00:05:56.606 --> 00:06:00.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Boy, there are a lot of people in the world
who could benefit from that counsel.

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:02.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that true?

00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:06.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like:
‘Does he or she ever shut up?

00:06:06.215 --> 00:06:09.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I mean, they must—
I bet you they talk in their sleep.

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:12.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They just won’t shut up.’

00:06:12.055 --> 00:06:14.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, anyway,
‘don’t be quick with your mouth,’

00:06:14.057 --> 00:06:17.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
particularly in context here

00:06:17.593 --> 00:06:19.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you’re speaking to Jehovah.

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:21.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Boy, those are some good things
to keep in mind,

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:24.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially for you brothers
who will speak in public.

00:06:24.133 --> 00:06:28.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you sisters too, when it’s personal
with your prayers to Jehovah,

00:06:28.771 --> 00:06:30.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t be quick with your mouth

00:06:30.773 --> 00:06:34.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you approach
the Sovereign of the universe.

00:06:34.177 --> 00:06:36.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your words should be few.

00:06:36.212 --> 00:06:40.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You do not impress God with vocabulary.

00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:44.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s impressed with sincerity of heart.

00:06:45.188 --> 00:06:49.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He loves those who love him.

00:06:49.792 --> 00:06:53.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in all different languages,
he treasures those prayers.

00:06:53.996 --> 00:06:55.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then he mentions this:

00:06:55.698 --> 00:06:59.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A dream comes
from too many preoccupations.”

00:06:59.135 --> 00:07:02.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the revised Bible here,
it says “too many cares.”

00:07:02.972 --> 00:07:07.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this idea isn’t just dreams
from a busy, busy day.

00:07:07.944 --> 00:07:10.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This preoccupation with self

00:07:10.947 --> 00:07:14.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is being warned against here.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t do it.
See, do not do it.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t be preoccupied with yourself.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:25.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for those who are,
there are many words from them.

00:07:25.394 --> 00:07:28.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But be careful, you know.

00:07:28.197 --> 00:07:32.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have the privilege now;
you’ll be praying more in public

00:07:32.668 --> 00:07:35.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—probably more than you ever have before.

00:07:35.438 --> 00:07:37.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You get privileges, you know.

00:07:37.507 --> 00:07:42.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you’re praying to Jehovah,
sometimes—

00:07:42.078 --> 00:07:44.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t want to be counseling
or criticizing prayers.

00:07:44.981 --> 00:07:46.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We try to be careful of that.

00:07:46.249 --> 00:07:50.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sometimes you even hear
a prayer at Bethel, and it’s like:

00:07:50.119 --> 00:07:54.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘OK. We’re trying to eat breakfast here.’

00:07:57.326 --> 00:08:01.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’ve told folks that it’s like,
you know, I just can’t help but—

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:06.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus is there, the most eloquent person
to walk the planet,

00:08:06.602 --> 00:08:08.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the meal comes.

00:08:08.971 --> 00:08:12.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He ‘raised his eyes to heaven’
and “gave thanks.”

00:08:13.543 --> 00:08:14.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Amen.

00:08:17.313 --> 00:08:19.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s eat.”

00:08:19.315 --> 00:08:22.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, there are other times
you want to pour out your heart and all that,

00:08:22.485 --> 00:08:26.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you’re not praying to the audience.

00:08:26.255 --> 00:08:28.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re talking
to the Sovereign of the universe.

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:31.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The counsel is, you know—

00:08:31.127 --> 00:08:33.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now I’m a Gilead graduate

00:08:33.362 --> 00:08:36.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(you brothers particularly),
so I’m going to have longer prayers.”

00:08:36.532 --> 00:08:38.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hope not.

00:08:38.801 --> 00:08:42.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I sure hope not unless they’re private.

00:08:42.271 --> 00:08:46.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then he gets into something crucial,

00:08:46.442 --> 00:08:51.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s just so important
to keep in mind verse 4.

00:08:51.447 --> 00:08:54.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read verses 4 and 5:

00:08:54.483 --> 00:08:56.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whenever you make a vow to God,

00:08:56.953 --> 00:09:00.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“do not delay to pay it,

00:09:00.122 --> 00:09:04.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for he finds no pleasure
in the stupid ones [morally stupid].”

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then it’s very clear:

00:09:06.262 --> 00:09:08.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What you vow, pay.”

00:09:09.599 --> 00:09:11.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What you vow, pay.”

00:09:11.601 --> 00:09:15.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then:
“[It’s] better for you not to vow

00:09:15.304 --> 00:09:17.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than to vow and not pay.”

00:09:17.907 --> 00:09:20.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is serious counsel,

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:24.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the warning is,
Don’t allow your mouth to cause you to sin.

00:09:25.748 --> 00:09:30.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when it comes to vows
(and some of you are married),

00:09:30.753 --> 00:09:32.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, you have the vow.

00:09:32.755 --> 00:09:35.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You always have to hold on to that.

00:09:35.258 --> 00:09:38.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not a light matter with Jehovah God.

00:09:38.194 --> 00:09:41.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And any other vows—be careful.

00:09:41.163 --> 00:09:43.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re going to make a vow,
it’s between you and him.

00:09:43.966 --> 00:09:47.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But see, notice here:

00:09:47.103 --> 00:09:51.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not allow [in verse 6]
your mouth to cause you to sin,

00:09:51.307 --> 00:09:53.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and do not say before the angel

00:09:53.876 --> 00:09:56.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[see, think about this]

00:09:56.979 --> 00:09:59.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it was a mistake.”

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:03.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah has the angels
doing all sorts of things.

00:10:03.119 --> 00:10:05.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t even begin to know the things

00:10:05.421 --> 00:10:07.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are always going on all the time

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:11.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah’s servants and his holy angels.

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:12.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s priceless.

00:10:12.461 --> 00:10:16.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But see, angels are, according to this,

00:10:16.432 --> 00:10:18.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
assigned to check on these things.

00:10:18.734 --> 00:10:21.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you don’t say to the angel:

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:24.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why, look, I made a mistake.
Forgive me.”

00:10:25.441 --> 00:10:27.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh-uh.

00:10:27.543 --> 00:10:29.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You made a vow.

00:10:29.578 --> 00:10:32.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But see, it shouldn’t be
because an angel is going to check

00:10:32.848 --> 00:10:35.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that that’s Jehovah’s direction.

00:10:35.184 --> 00:10:39.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It should be
because of our love for Jehovah.

00:10:41.257 --> 00:10:45.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you make a vow (you know,
whether it was marriage or whatever),

00:10:45.194 --> 00:10:50.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s your love for Jehovah
—that’s what cements the vow.

00:10:50.032 --> 00:10:52.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It matters.

00:10:52.034 --> 00:10:55.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, it matters to him.

00:10:56.405 --> 00:11:00.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So then finally, in verse 7:

00:11:00.609 --> 00:11:04.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For just as many preoccupations
lead to dreams,

00:11:04.246 --> 00:11:08.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so, too, many words lead to futility.”

00:11:08.351 --> 00:11:10.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s good counsel.

00:11:10.686 --> 00:11:14.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are so filled

00:11:14.557 --> 00:11:16.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Word of God.

00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:18.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a special class,

00:11:18.561 --> 00:11:22.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Gilead is a special school.

00:11:22.598 --> 00:11:26.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have other schools, SKE;
I’ll mention something later about that.

00:11:26.802 --> 00:11:29.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this is unique

00:11:29.372 --> 00:11:33.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to have men whom
Jehovah has appointed to instruct.

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:36.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Teaching Committee selects them

00:11:36.746 --> 00:11:41.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—totally whole-souled
and devoted to Jehovah God—

00:11:41.016 --> 00:11:43.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach you during the class.

00:11:43.686 --> 00:11:46.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’re going over all these things
in the Word of God.

00:11:46.522 --> 00:11:49.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so it’s all in there,

00:11:49.592 --> 00:11:52.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s just special.

00:11:52.628 --> 00:11:56.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you thank Jehovah
that you have this education,

00:11:56.499 --> 00:12:01.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’re going
to move forward to glorify him.

00:12:02.705 --> 00:12:06.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s pretty similar
to what is mentioned here

00:12:06.776 --> 00:12:10.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the last sentence in verse 7:

00:12:10.446 --> 00:12:14.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But fear the true God.”

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you soon-to-be graduates,

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:19.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keep those words in your heart.

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:23.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just “fear the true God” in the days ahead,

00:12:23.359 --> 00:12:28.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and stay away from these kind of dreams

00:12:28.197 --> 00:12:32.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about self-preoccupation, you know?

00:12:33.636 --> 00:12:36.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mm-mm.
No, not for you.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:42.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Otherwise, your education was futile,

00:12:42.144 --> 00:12:43.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not good.

00:12:43.813 --> 00:12:47.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I don’t see that in any of you
(and I’m not implying).

00:12:47.416 --> 00:12:50.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s such wise counsel

00:12:50.419 --> 00:12:52.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Jehovah God in his Word.

00:12:52.822 --> 00:12:55.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there’s much, much more there.

00:12:55.057 --> 00:12:57.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enjoy thinking about it

00:12:57.827 --> 00:13:01.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a little tool we have there,
the <i>Research Guide.</i>

00:13:02.965 --> 00:13:07.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we appreciate the next speaker very much

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:10.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and he put his heart into his talk),

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:12.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Mark Sanderson.

00:13:12.775 --> 00:13:15.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we have a nice lineup

00:13:15.144 --> 00:13:17.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the brothers who’ve prepared their talks

00:13:17.713 --> 00:13:20.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all their heart.

00:13:20.182 --> 00:13:22.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mark is a member of the Governing Body,

00:13:22.184 --> 00:13:26.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his talk is a question as a theme,

00:13:26.522 --> 00:13:30.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What Will They Be Like?”

00:13:30.125 --> 00:13:31.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Sanderson, please.

00:13:39.568 --> 00:13:44.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Luke 6:40, Jesus said:

00:13:44.573 --> 00:13:48.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A student is not above his teacher,

00:13:48.511 --> 00:13:52.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but everyone who is perfectly instructed

00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:55.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be like his teacher.”

00:13:55.718 --> 00:13:59.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, what comes to your mind
when you think about this verse?

00:13:59.455 --> 00:14:01.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you tend to think of it in terms

00:14:01.891 --> 00:14:04.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of when you conduct
a Bible study with someone.

00:14:04.527 --> 00:14:06.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or you might think about it

00:14:06.529 --> 00:14:09.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you go to a program like Gilead

00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:12.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’re instructed there.

00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:14.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in reality,

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:18.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are all teachers every day

00:14:18.807 --> 00:14:23.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the classroom of Christian living.

00:14:23.112 --> 00:14:25.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we have responsibilities,

00:14:25.814 --> 00:14:28.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we enjoy certain privileges,

00:14:28.584 --> 00:14:33.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers and sisters will watch us.

00:14:33.222 --> 00:14:36.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And those who work closely with us

00:14:36.559 --> 00:14:38.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will learn from us.

00:14:38.594 --> 00:14:43.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they will become like us.

00:14:43.566 --> 00:14:47.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take the example of the apostle Paul.

00:14:47.036 --> 00:14:50.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we know Paul
was an outstanding teacher.

00:14:50.673 --> 00:14:51.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine?

00:14:51.874 --> 00:14:56.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Under inspiration,
he had the privilege to write 14 books

00:14:56.579 --> 00:14:59.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:14:59.048 --> 00:15:02.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, that was not the only way

00:15:02.685 --> 00:15:05.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the apostle Paul taught others.

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:08.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His example in Christian living

00:15:08.791 --> 00:15:10.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was very powerful.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what could people learn
from the example of Paul?

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:16.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider some examples.

00:15:16.832 --> 00:15:21.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go first to 1 Thessalonians chapter 2,

00:15:21.837 --> 00:15:25.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
1 Thessalonians chapter 2,

00:15:25.207 --> 00:15:27.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s look at verse 7:

00:15:27.943 --> 00:15:32.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On the contrary,
we became gentle in your midst,

00:15:32.881 --> 00:15:36.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as when a nursing mother
tenderly cares for her own children.

00:15:36.919 --> 00:15:40.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So having tender affection for you,

00:15:40.322 --> 00:15:42.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we were determined to impart to you,

00:15:42.524 --> 00:15:45.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not only the good news of God

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but also our very selves,

00:15:48.764 --> 00:15:53.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you became so beloved to us.”

00:15:53.769 --> 00:15:57.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul worked hard for the brothers.

00:15:57.339 --> 00:15:58.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was kind.

00:15:58.774 --> 00:16:00.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was gentle with them.

00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:04.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was willing to give
not just the message of the truth but,

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:09.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he says in verse 8, “our very selves.”

00:16:09.718 --> 00:16:14.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And brothers, that was the truth.

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:18.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul said he was willing to do “all things

00:16:18.527 --> 00:16:20.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the sake of the good news.”

00:16:20.663 --> 00:16:23.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just consider
some of the things that he did.

00:16:23.298 --> 00:16:26.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go to 2 Corinthians chapter 11

00:16:26.468 --> 00:16:30.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just remind ourselves of some
of the things Paul went through.

00:16:30.939 --> 00:16:35.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Corinthians 11:23

00:16:35.944 --> 00:16:38.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Paul says:
“Are they ministers of Christ?

00:16:38.747 --> 00:16:42.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I reply like a madman,
I am more outstandingly one:

00:16:42.785 --> 00:16:46.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have done more work,
been imprisoned more often,

00:16:46.388 --> 00:16:50.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“suffered countless beatings,
and experienced many near-deaths.

00:16:50.659 --> 00:16:55.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Five times I received
40 strokes less one from the Jews,

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“three times I was beaten with rods,

00:16:57.766 --> 00:17:02.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“once I was stoned,
three times I experienced shipwreck,

00:17:02.304 --> 00:17:05.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a night and a day
I have spent in the open sea.”

00:17:05.841 --> 00:17:09.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the list just goes on.

00:17:09.878 --> 00:17:14.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What could these ones

00:17:14.416 --> 00:17:17.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who worked with Paul learn from him?

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:20.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, how did
Paul’s powerful example

00:17:20.756 --> 00:17:22.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of love for God,

00:17:22.758 --> 00:17:25.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of endurance, of hard work,

00:17:25.561 --> 00:17:27.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and of true unselfishness

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:31.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
affect those around him?

00:17:31.366 --> 00:17:35.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, consider Timothy,
who worked so closely with Paul.

00:17:35.337 --> 00:17:37.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did Paul say about him?

00:17:37.206 --> 00:17:41.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go to Philippians chapter 2

00:17:41.944 --> 00:17:46.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Philippians 2:20.

00:17:46.882 --> 00:17:50.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul said: “For I have no one else

00:17:50.385 --> 00:17:52.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of a disposition like his

00:17:52.554 --> 00:17:55.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who will genuinely care for your concerns.

00:17:55.991 --> 00:17:58.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For all the others
are seeking their own interests,

00:17:58.727 --> 00:18:01.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not those of Jesus Christ.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But you know the proof he gave of himself,

00:18:04.566 --> 00:18:06.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that like a child with a father

00:18:06.869 --> 00:18:11.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he slaved with me
to advance the good news.”

00:18:11.306 --> 00:18:13.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, here’s a question:

00:18:13.675 --> 00:18:16.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why was Timothy that way?

00:18:16.578 --> 00:18:19.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why was Timothy so unselfish?

00:18:19.515 --> 00:18:23.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did he work so hard for other people?

00:18:23.619 --> 00:18:27.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, no doubt, he was “perfectly instructed”

00:18:27.856 --> 00:18:30.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just by the words

00:18:30.259 --> 00:18:33.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but by the example of Paul.

00:18:33.896 --> 00:18:37.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the same thing
could be true of Priscilla and Aquila.

00:18:37.132 --> 00:18:41.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul said about them
that they had risked their necks for him.

00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:45.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, where did they learn that from?

00:18:45.908 --> 00:18:48.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, we could go on
with other examples

00:18:48.343 --> 00:18:52.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of other close associates of Paul,
but what is the point?

00:18:52.648 --> 00:18:55.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul’s example in Christian living

00:18:55.851 --> 00:18:58.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
instructed those around him.

00:18:58.453 --> 00:19:01.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They became like Paul.

00:19:01.456 --> 00:19:06.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why is that important to you
who are graduating today

00:19:06.428 --> 00:19:09.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead?

00:19:09.798 --> 00:19:13.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, very soon you’re going to be graduates,

00:19:13.635 --> 00:19:16.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your mandate is to go forth

00:19:16.638 --> 00:19:19.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and strengthen and stabilize

00:19:19.408 --> 00:19:22.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the field and branch territory.

00:19:22.277 --> 00:19:24.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, that’s a big long term, isn’t it?

00:19:24.913 --> 00:19:28.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the field and branch territory?

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:30.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s people.

00:19:30.752 --> 00:19:34.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s people
—spiritual men and women

00:19:34.523 --> 00:19:37.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who want to learn,

00:19:37.459 --> 00:19:39.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who want to be trained,

00:19:39.761 --> 00:19:44.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who want to reach the spiritual goals
that they’ve set for themselves,

00:19:44.399 --> 00:19:48.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who want to grow to Christian maturity.

00:19:48.437 --> 00:19:52.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because you are a Gilead graduate,

00:19:52.374 --> 00:19:56.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will watch you, they will listen to you,

00:19:56.945 --> 00:20:01.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will be instructed by your example.

00:20:01.917 --> 00:20:04.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I went to serve many years ago

00:20:04.519 --> 00:20:07.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the need was great
on the island of Newfoundland,

00:20:07.956 --> 00:20:11.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were so blessed
to have in our congregation

00:20:11.426 --> 00:20:16.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a graduate of the 7th class of Gilead,
Brother Fred Wiens.

00:20:16.398 --> 00:20:20.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Wiens was an anointed brother
who was baptized

00:20:20.202 --> 00:20:22.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 1928.

00:20:22.571 --> 00:20:25.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I’ll be honest with you;

00:20:25.007 --> 00:20:29.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t remember even one talk
that Fred Wiens gave.

00:20:29.811 --> 00:20:33.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But his warmth, his sense of humor,

00:20:33.982 --> 00:20:37.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his zeal for the ministry,
and his love for people

00:20:37.819 --> 00:20:40.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the example that he set—

00:20:40.489 --> 00:20:43.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is truly unforgettable.

00:20:43.325 --> 00:20:45.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fred talked to everyone

00:20:45.294 --> 00:20:48.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and I mean everyone—
in the ministry.

00:20:48.397 --> 00:20:52.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One time we were out in service;
we pulled into the gas station.

00:20:52.901 --> 00:20:55.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As soon as we stopped the car,
Fred jumped out.

00:20:55.737 --> 00:20:57.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we were ready to leave,

00:20:57.873 --> 00:21:00.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we looked around to try to find Fred.

00:21:00.475 --> 00:21:03.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wasn’t in the store;
he wasn’t in the bathroom.

00:21:03.478 --> 00:21:05.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was nowhere to be seen.

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, we thought
we’d check the other cars.

00:21:08.417 --> 00:21:11.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s exactly where Fred was.

00:21:11.153 --> 00:21:14.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fred had knocked on the window
and gotten in a car

00:21:14.389 --> 00:21:19.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and started to preach
to all the people in that car.

00:21:19.027 --> 00:21:22.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fred has now gone on to his reward.

00:21:22.731 --> 00:21:26.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But his example of warmth, kindness,

00:21:26.501 --> 00:21:31.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
zeal, and love for people
continue to teach me

00:21:31.106 --> 00:21:35.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and many others who knew him well—
right down to this day.

00:21:35.677 --> 00:21:40.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here is the question
that rests before you:

00:21:40.349 --> 00:21:45.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will you teach others by your example?

00:21:45.187 --> 00:21:47.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be like Paul.

00:21:47.222 --> 00:21:51.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Love your brothers and sisters
right from your heart.

00:21:51.126 --> 00:21:53.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through your example,

00:21:53.228 --> 00:21:57.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
create an atmosphere of warmth and love

00:21:57.265 --> 00:22:00.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like a greenhouse
where young plants

00:22:00.702 --> 00:22:03.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can blossom and grow.

00:22:03.405 --> 00:22:07.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your fine example
can warm up a congregation,

00:22:07.743 --> 00:22:12.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a circuit, a Bethel department,
perhaps even a branch office.

00:22:12.748 --> 00:22:15.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never allow yourself

00:22:15.784 --> 00:22:19.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be a cold executive

00:22:19.287 --> 00:22:24.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who creates an atmosphere like a freezer,

00:22:24.192 --> 00:22:27.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because those little plants

00:22:27.229 --> 00:22:29.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will shrivel up

00:22:29.264 --> 00:22:33.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will stop growing
in that environment.

00:22:33.135 --> 00:22:37.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, be willing to impart
not just the many wonderful truths

00:22:37.305 --> 00:22:39.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of God’s Word that you learned at Gilead

00:22:39.941 --> 00:22:43.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also your own heart and your own soul.

00:22:43.879 --> 00:22:48.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then because those beautiful,
spiritual people you work with

00:22:48.483 --> 00:22:51.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be properly instructed,

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what will they be like?

00:22:54.523 --> 00:22:58.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will be just like you.

00:22:58.493 --> 00:23:01.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And may the blessing
of our marvelous God, Jehovah,

00:23:01.563 --> 00:23:03.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
go with you wherever you go.

00:23:11.006 --> 00:23:13.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much, Brother Sanderson,

00:23:13.241 --> 00:23:16.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for that interesting Scriptural discussion

00:23:16.445 --> 00:23:19.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some of those past experiences.

00:23:19.848 --> 00:23:21.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, the brother might be saying,

00:23:21.983 --> 00:23:24.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You should have paid
closer attention to my talks.’

00:23:25.053 --> 00:23:27.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, no.

00:23:27.055 --> 00:23:29.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was obvious how much you loved him.

00:23:30.392 --> 00:23:34.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, OK.

00:23:34.729 --> 00:23:37.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clive Martin,
a helper to the Writing Committee,

00:23:37.332 --> 00:23:41.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is going to address us now
with this interesting theme,

00:23:41.169 --> 00:23:44.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Remember the Terms of Peace?”

00:23:46.475 --> 00:23:49.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever had to sue for peace?

00:23:50.312 --> 00:23:52.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While you’re thinking of that question,

00:23:52.314 --> 00:23:55.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would you please turn with me
to Luke chapter 14?

00:23:56.618 --> 00:23:58.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to put you and me

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the middle of one of Jesus’ illustrations.

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:05.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus has been talking about what it costs

00:24:05.227 --> 00:24:07.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to become one of his disciples.

00:24:07.729 --> 00:24:11.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in verse 31, he says:

00:24:11.566 --> 00:24:13.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Or what king

00:24:13.735 --> 00:24:16.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[this is where we come in, what king]

00:24:16.905 --> 00:24:19.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“marching out against another king in war

00:24:19.207 --> 00:24:23.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“does not first sit down and take counsel
whether he is able with 10,000 troops

00:24:23.945 --> 00:24:28.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to stand up to the one who comes
against him with 20,000?

00:24:28.717 --> 00:24:30.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If, in fact, he cannot do so,

00:24:30.819 --> 00:24:34.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“then while that one is yet far away,

00:24:34.623 --> 00:24:39.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he sends out a body of ambassadors
and sues for peace.”

00:24:41.062 --> 00:24:45.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you think that conversation goes?

00:24:45.367 --> 00:24:48.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I want peace, and these are my terms.”

00:24:49.538 --> 00:24:50.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hardly!

00:24:51.439 --> 00:24:55.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s more like:
“I don’t want to be your enemy.

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:59.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please tell me what to do
so that I can have peace with you.”

00:25:01.082 --> 00:25:05.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, with that in mind,
Jesus gives the application, verse 33:

00:25:05.987 --> 00:25:10.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the same way, you may be sure
that not one of you

00:25:10.425 --> 00:25:14.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who does not say good-bye
to all his belongings

00:25:14.029 --> 00:25:16.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be my disciple.”

00:25:17.432 --> 00:25:19.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is you and me.

00:25:19.834 --> 00:25:21.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We got to the point where we realized

00:25:21.836 --> 00:25:24.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we did not want to be an enemy of Jehovah.

00:25:24.606 --> 00:25:28.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we were willing
to sacrifice everything

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:32.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—belongings, career, status, everything—

00:25:32.147 --> 00:25:35.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the privilege of being
at peace with Jehovah

00:25:35.483 --> 00:25:37.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and being a disciple of his Son.

00:25:38.286 --> 00:25:41.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now for you students of class 150,

00:25:41.189 --> 00:25:43.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your pursuit of peace with Jehovah

00:25:43.792 --> 00:25:46.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has led you
into the special full-time service.

00:25:46.761 --> 00:25:50.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a beautiful record
every one of you has set!

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You remind me in many ways

00:25:55.003 --> 00:25:57.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a group in the Bible

00:25:57.339 --> 00:26:00.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that literally sued for peace.

00:26:00.742 --> 00:26:04.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their story is told
in the book of Joshua chapter 9.

00:26:04.512 --> 00:26:08.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right;
we’re talking about the Gibeonites.

00:26:08.717 --> 00:26:11.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have Joshua chapter 9?

00:26:11.186 --> 00:26:14.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, they had heard of all the things
that Jehovah had done

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:19.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for his people, Israel, and to his enemies.

00:26:19.094 --> 00:26:21.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They did not want to be Jehovah’s enemy.

00:26:21.563 --> 00:26:26.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so they did exactly
what the king in Jesus’ illustration did.

00:26:26.167 --> 00:26:29.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They sent a body of ambassadors.

00:26:29.037 --> 00:26:31.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Joshua chapter 9

00:26:31.973 --> 00:26:35.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and this is the opening overture

00:26:35.944 --> 00:26:39.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in verse 6:

00:26:39.314 --> 00:26:41.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We have come from a distant land.

00:26:41.816 --> 00:26:44.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now make a covenant with us.”

00:26:45.787 --> 00:26:50.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they didn’t get a very warm
initial reception, they persisted.

00:26:50.759 --> 00:26:54.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 8: “We are your servants.”

00:26:54.663 --> 00:26:59.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words,
“Set the terms; we want peace.”

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were willing to sacrifice everything

00:27:03.104 --> 00:27:07.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to enjoy peace
with Israel and with Israel’s God.

00:27:08.109 --> 00:27:11.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Joshua and the chieftains
didn’t see it exactly the same way,

00:27:11.646 --> 00:27:14.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
particularly when they found out

00:27:14.449 --> 00:27:17.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they were not from a distant land
as they had claimed.

00:27:17.352 --> 00:27:19.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nobody likes to be fooled.

00:27:19.354 --> 00:27:22.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the tone got a little sterner.

00:27:22.724 --> 00:27:25.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So turn and look at verse 23.

00:27:25.794 --> 00:27:29.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what they said:
“From now on you are cursed,

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:32.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and you will always occupy
a slave’s position

00:27:32.467 --> 00:27:36.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as gatherers of wood and drawers of water
for the house of my God.”

00:27:38.306 --> 00:27:40.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will the Gibeonites say to that?

00:27:41.443 --> 00:27:45.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 25: “We are at your mercy.

00:27:45.447 --> 00:27:49.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do to us whatever you think
is good and right.”

00:27:51.052 --> 00:27:54.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just so, the terms of peace were set.

00:27:54.723 --> 00:27:58.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 27: “That day Joshua made them

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:01.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“gatherers of wood and drawers of water

00:28:01.129 --> 00:28:03.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for the assembly and for Jehovah’s altar

00:28:03.898 --> 00:28:06.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“at the place that He should choose,

00:28:06.167 --> 00:28:08.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they remain so to this day.”

00:28:09.904 --> 00:28:13.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now a few questions, a few lessons.

00:28:13.007 --> 00:28:16.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think
of the Gibeonites’ assignment?

00:28:17.479 --> 00:28:20.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was presented to them as a punishment.

00:28:20.482 --> 00:28:22.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But just think,

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:25.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they weren’t being sold off
as household slaves.

00:28:25.653 --> 00:28:29.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their humble service
would directly contribute

00:28:29.224 --> 00:28:33.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pure worship and support Jehovah’s people.

00:28:34.863 --> 00:28:36.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a privilege, isn’t it?

00:28:36.865 --> 00:28:41.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the kind of service
we reach out for as a privilege.

00:28:43.638 --> 00:28:46.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the kind of service—

00:28:46.007 --> 00:28:49.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was it because they were lowly people,

00:28:49.444 --> 00:28:54.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no skills to do anything else,
that they were given this kind of job?

00:28:54.349 --> 00:28:57.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, look at chapter 10

00:28:57.619 --> 00:28:59.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 2

00:29:00.922 --> 00:29:03.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see the kind of people
the Gibeonites were:

00:29:03.191 --> 00:29:07.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Gibeon was a great city,
like one of the royal cities.

00:29:07.429 --> 00:29:11.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It was greater than Ai,
and all its men were warriors

00:29:13.701 --> 00:29:16.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[capable, skilled people].”

00:29:16.771 --> 00:29:19.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However,

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
clearly the Gibeonites realized

00:29:21.142 --> 00:29:24.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if their army was no match for Israel,

00:29:24.746 --> 00:29:27.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then Jehovah didn’t need them

00:29:27.449 --> 00:29:30.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to bolster his army
in order to complete the conquest.

00:29:30.485 --> 00:29:32.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was better for them

00:29:32.654 --> 00:29:37.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to ask Jehovah what he wanted them to do
and to do that.

00:29:37.392 --> 00:29:42.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the sacrifice was definitely worth it.

00:29:42.363 --> 00:29:47.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does that mean, though,
that their skills were irrelevant,

00:29:47.135 --> 00:29:49.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
never even considered?

00:29:49.838 --> 00:29:51.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, no.

00:29:51.005 --> 00:29:53.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, a few hundred years later,

00:29:53.942 --> 00:29:55.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ishmaiah the Gibeonite

00:29:55.977 --> 00:29:59.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is listed among David’s 30 mighty men.

00:29:59.881 --> 00:30:03.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Different needs call for different skills.

00:30:03.918 --> 00:30:07.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did Ishmaiah do with his skill?

00:30:07.422 --> 00:30:12.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he humbly defended pure worship
and Jehovah’s people.

00:30:12.327 --> 00:30:15.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the details of the assignment
were different,

00:30:15.563 --> 00:30:18.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the focus was about the same.

00:30:20.735 --> 00:30:23.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another question: Was this just

00:30:23.671 --> 00:30:26.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a short-term starter assignment?

00:30:26.574 --> 00:30:30.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Yes, we will do this for now,
but once the campaign is over,

00:30:30.378 --> 00:30:34.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll be able to resume
our regular place in society.”

00:30:36.618 --> 00:30:39.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go back to verse 27 of chapter 9.

00:30:39.787 --> 00:30:42.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember what Joshua said at this point

00:30:42.724 --> 00:30:44.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he gave them their assignment?

00:30:44.425 --> 00:30:48.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They remain so to this day.”

00:30:48.029 --> 00:30:52.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only to the day
that Joshua wrote these words

00:30:53.434 --> 00:30:56.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but about 900 years later

00:30:56.504 --> 00:31:00.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
among the exiles that returned
from Babylon to Jerusalem

00:31:00.675 --> 00:31:04.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to restore pure worship
there were temple servants,

00:31:04.913 --> 00:31:07.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and likely

00:31:07.048 --> 00:31:10.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this included descendants of the Gibeonites.

00:31:10.351 --> 00:31:13.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just think, these temple servants

00:31:13.888 --> 00:31:18.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
once again were willing to leave behind
the life that they’d built up

00:31:18.159 --> 00:31:21.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make the trek in behalf of pure worship

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:23.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take up their duties.

00:31:23.932 --> 00:31:27.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They must have really cherished
their assignment

00:31:27.235 --> 00:31:29.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to stick to it that way.

00:31:31.973 --> 00:31:33.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as we’ve talked about them,

00:31:33.975 --> 00:31:36.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have you been noting some personal lessons?

00:31:36.778 --> 00:31:39.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are the four that come to my mind.

00:31:40.515 --> 00:31:43.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number one, as with the king

00:31:43.284 --> 00:31:46.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jesus’ illustration and the Gibeonites,

00:31:46.854 --> 00:31:50.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
peace with Jehovah is such a treasure.

00:31:50.258 --> 00:31:53.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re willing to sacrifice
anything to enjoy it.

00:31:55.063 --> 00:31:58.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number two, Jehovah’s terms for us

00:31:58.666 --> 00:32:01.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
include humble service

00:32:01.536 --> 00:32:05.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on behalf of pure worship
and in support of his people,

00:32:05.807 --> 00:32:08.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that kind of humble service

00:32:08.209 --> 00:32:11.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we view as the greatest privilege.

00:32:11.613 --> 00:32:16.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number three, different needs
call for different skills,

00:32:16.217 --> 00:32:20.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that may lead to a change of assignment

00:32:20.021 --> 00:32:23.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you or for someone else.

00:32:23.291 --> 00:32:26.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Either way, we don’t compete
and we don’t compare.

00:32:26.995 --> 00:32:29.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The details of the assignment
may be different,

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:33.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the focus, or goal, is always the same.

00:32:33.234 --> 00:32:36.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the fourth one,

00:32:36.137 --> 00:32:38.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we cherish our assignments.

00:32:38.373 --> 00:32:42.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to stay in them
as long as Jehovah allows.

00:32:43.745 --> 00:32:47.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In short, we cherish our assignments;

00:32:47.081 --> 00:32:49.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we love our God.

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:53.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peace with Jehovah is a treasure
that we will never let go.

00:33:00.228 --> 00:33:02.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much.

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:04.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We appreciated that very much.

00:33:04.666 --> 00:33:07.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re now at peace, Brother Martin.

00:33:07.101 --> 00:33:10.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you
for those kind, encouraging thoughts.

00:33:10.672 --> 00:33:14.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is something special
for you here in the class,

00:33:14.976 --> 00:33:19.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the 150th class of Gilead.

00:33:19.881 --> 00:33:24.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you may be wondering
about your post-graduation life.

00:33:24.085 --> 00:33:27.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve probably been doing that
at least a couple of weeks.

00:33:28.356 --> 00:33:32.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how will you use
what you’ve learned from Gilead

00:33:32.026 --> 00:33:34.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to strengthen and stabilize

00:33:34.395 --> 00:33:37.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the branch organization and others?

00:33:38.633 --> 00:33:41.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Brother Sanderson touched on that,

00:33:41.769 --> 00:33:44.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’ll hear more later about that.

00:33:44.172 --> 00:33:46.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s our purpose.

00:33:46.441 --> 00:33:48.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s a question to ponder.

00:33:48.976 --> 00:33:51.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if you could look down the road

00:33:51.879 --> 00:33:54.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—let’s say 2, 4, 6,

00:33:54.782 --> 00:33:58.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even 30 years

00:33:58.152 --> 00:34:02.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into the future from this day of graduation?

00:34:04.125 --> 00:34:06.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’d be nice to be able to do.

00:34:06.494 --> 00:34:08.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’re pleased to inform you

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:11.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Teaching Committee has included

00:34:11.866 --> 00:34:14.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at this graduation a special feature

00:34:14.535 --> 00:34:17.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in connection with this graduation.

00:34:17.638 --> 00:34:21.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It consists of four prerecorded interviews

00:34:21.275 --> 00:34:26.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Gilead graduates
currently in their assignments.

00:34:26.047 --> 00:34:28.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all four of the brothers

00:34:28.316 --> 00:34:31.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are serving on Branch Committees;

00:34:31.786 --> 00:34:33.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re Branch Committee members.

00:34:33.921 --> 00:34:36.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the interviews will begin now,

00:34:36.724 --> 00:34:41.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then another will follow
each of the next three parts of the program.

00:34:41.729 --> 00:34:44.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’ll have a part and then an interview.

00:34:44.465 --> 00:34:47.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, first,
we’re going to travel to the country

00:34:47.001 --> 00:34:51.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:34:51.005 --> 00:34:53.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There we find a brother who graduated

00:34:53.407 --> 00:34:57.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the 138th class of Gilead.

00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:02.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen as he explains how his Gilead training

00:35:02.016 --> 00:35:04.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has helped him to work humbly

00:35:04.418 --> 00:35:08.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with his fellow brothers
and Branch Committee members.

00:35:08.923 --> 00:35:10.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enjoy the video.

00:35:12.527 --> 00:35:14.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother and Sister Kabitshwa

00:35:14.529 --> 00:35:16.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be returning to Congo.

00:35:16.097 --> 00:35:17.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s difficult

00:35:17.732 --> 00:35:19.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find one word,

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or expression,

00:35:20.601 --> 00:35:23.437 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that can sum up what I personally feel

00:35:23.437 --> 00:35:25.640 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
after this training in Gilead.

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:29.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The in-depth study of Jehovah’s personality

00:35:29.143 --> 00:35:31.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
opened my eyes more fully

00:35:31.145 --> 00:35:33.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the way he values people.

00:35:33.548 --> 00:35:36.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this has helped me to look

00:35:36.417 --> 00:35:39.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for opportunities to strengthen others

00:35:39.387 --> 00:35:43.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by placing their interests above my own.

00:35:43.558 --> 00:35:45.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, my wife and I

00:35:45.593 --> 00:35:48.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made ourselves available
to support the brothers

00:35:48.462 --> 00:35:50.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in cleaning a regional convention venue.

00:35:50.498 --> 00:35:53.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They laughed, thinking that we were joking.

00:35:53.601 --> 00:35:55.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally, they gave us

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:57.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
humble tasks in cleaning.

00:35:57.438 --> 00:36:00.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We did it with joy, and it allowed me

00:36:00.341 --> 00:36:03.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get to know the brothers
in the circuits better.

00:36:03.077 --> 00:36:05.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Taking these opportunities

00:36:05.146 --> 00:36:08.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has a much more profound effect
on the brothers

00:36:08.616 --> 00:36:10.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than simply giving talks.

00:36:10.718 --> 00:36:12.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gilead has also helped me

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:15.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show honor to the other members

00:36:15.323 --> 00:36:17.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Branch Committee.

00:36:17.358 --> 00:36:18.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the committee I serve,

00:36:18.626 --> 00:36:21.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are brothers of different age groups.

00:36:21.128 --> 00:36:24.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While I feel that my normal inclination

00:36:24.031 --> 00:36:25.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to speak too much,

00:36:25.666 --> 00:36:27.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have learned from others on the committee

00:36:27.869 --> 00:36:29.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to humbly listen.

00:36:29.804 --> 00:36:33.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, I had to present a concept
to the Branch Committee,

00:36:33.574 --> 00:36:36.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I put all my heart into the presentation.

00:36:36.811 --> 00:36:40.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was 100 percent sure it would be approved.

00:36:40.848 --> 00:36:42.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Guess what?

00:36:42.316 --> 00:36:44.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
None of the options were approved.

00:36:44.418 --> 00:36:49.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Honestly, inside myself,
I was upset and ready to give up.

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:52.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped me was meditating on the example

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:55.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of another fellow Branch Committee member

00:36:55.396 --> 00:36:58.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how he reacted in times like this.

00:36:58.766 --> 00:37:00.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to Gilead, I have learned

00:37:00.801 --> 00:37:05.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to benefit from the qualities
of each one of the brothers I work with,

00:37:05.006 --> 00:37:09.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter who they are
or the experience they have.

00:37:09.443 --> 00:37:11.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s organization

00:37:11.746 --> 00:37:16.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is made up of people
from different cultures and backgrounds,

00:37:16.751 --> 00:37:20.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and these differences can at times be to us

00:37:20.388 --> 00:37:24.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like a huge gap that threatens our unity.

00:37:24.425 --> 00:37:28.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In one of our lessons at Gilead,

00:37:28.095 --> 00:37:30.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 5:3 was used to show

00:37:30.865 --> 00:37:34.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the only way to bridge the gap

00:37:34.068 --> 00:37:36.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to be a spiritual person.

00:37:36.537 --> 00:37:39.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So every time I’m overwhelmed

00:37:39.807 --> 00:37:42.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by a feeling of inadequacy

00:37:42.209 --> 00:37:45.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or I’m about to vent my frustrations,

00:37:45.379 --> 00:37:48.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I reconnect to Jehovah and Jesus

00:37:48.215 --> 00:37:51.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by studying the Bible and praying for help.

00:37:51.719 --> 00:37:53.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would definitely say that Gilead

00:37:53.988 --> 00:37:56.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has given me all the tools I need

00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:58.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build the bridge of unity

00:37:58.359 --> 00:38:01.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
among Jehovah’s people whenever I see a gap

00:38:01.395 --> 00:38:05.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and that tool is
to feed my own spirituality.

00:38:12.306 --> 00:38:15.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a nice addition for the program.

00:38:15.676 --> 00:38:17.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We look forward to the other videos.

00:38:17.912 --> 00:38:21.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, next,
we have a helper to the Teaching Committee.

00:38:21.315 --> 00:38:23.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s been so for a long time.

00:38:23.684 --> 00:38:25.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not picking on your age, Bill,

00:38:27.288 --> 00:38:29.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you look good.

00:38:29.824 --> 00:38:31.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s because his wife, Sandy,
is right out there,

00:38:31.993 --> 00:38:33.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I try to be careful.

00:38:35.896 --> 00:38:38.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we always look forward
to what Brother Malenfant has

00:38:38.699 --> 00:38:40.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to share with us.

00:38:40.701 --> 00:38:43.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His theme is “‘Boast in Jehovah.’”

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:51.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many people who love to boast.

00:38:51.145 --> 00:38:55.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Politicians frequently boast
about what they have done

00:38:55.449 --> 00:38:58.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what they have promised to do
for their constituents.

00:38:58.986 --> 00:39:00.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And businessmen,

00:39:00.988 --> 00:39:04.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they love to boast
about how successful they are

00:39:04.325 --> 00:39:07.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how much money they are making.

00:39:07.194 --> 00:39:11.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And athletes, you know,
athletes are prideful, many of them.

00:39:11.799 --> 00:39:14.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they boast about the events

00:39:14.268 --> 00:39:16.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they’ve been great in
and that they’ve won.

00:39:16.971 --> 00:39:20.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, you know, it’s interesting to note

00:39:20.241 --> 00:39:23.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in the highly competitive sports world,

00:39:23.277 --> 00:39:26.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is an expression for great achievers.

00:39:26.547 --> 00:39:30.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The expression is GOAT

00:39:30.117 --> 00:39:33.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—G-O-A-T—

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
greatest of all time.

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:38.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine people thinking

00:39:38.692 --> 00:39:42.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that somehow they have been
the greatest of all time?

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:46.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we hear the words
“greatest of all time,”

00:39:46.434 --> 00:39:49.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only one person comes to mind.

00:39:49.403 --> 00:39:51.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was the greatest man who ever lived

00:39:51.939 --> 00:39:55.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—truly the greatest of all time,
Jesus Christ.

00:39:55.676 --> 00:39:58.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And his greatness had nothing to do

00:39:58.979 --> 00:40:02.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with politics, business,

00:40:02.149 --> 00:40:04.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or playing games.

00:40:04.652 --> 00:40:07.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it had everything to do

00:40:07.121 --> 00:40:11.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with praising Jehovah and boasting

00:40:11.525 --> 00:40:13.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah God.

00:40:13.894 --> 00:40:16.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus knew the counsel that’s recorded

00:40:16.097 --> 00:40:19.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Jeremiah chapter 9,

00:40:19.533 --> 00:40:22.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 23, 24.

00:40:22.303 --> 00:40:25.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this scripture, this text, is beautiful.

00:40:25.339 --> 00:40:28.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah 9:23, 24

00:40:28.075 --> 00:40:30.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it says:

00:40:30.077 --> 00:40:33.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is what Jehovah says:

00:40:33.414 --> 00:40:38.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Let not the wise man boast
about his wisdom;

00:40:38.052 --> 00:40:42.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘let not the mighty man boast
about his mightiness;

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:47.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and let not the rich man boast
about his riches.

00:40:47.495 --> 00:40:50.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘But let the one boasting

“‘the One showing loyal love,

“‘justice, and righteousness in the earth,

00:41:06.347 --> 00:41:08.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for in these things

00:41:08.516 --> 00:41:12.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I take delight,’ declares Jehovah.”

00:41:12.186 --> 00:41:14.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that beautiful?

00:41:14.188 --> 00:41:16.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So to boast in Jehovah really means

00:41:16.257 --> 00:41:19.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we take pride in our God, Jehovah.

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:21.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re proud to bear his name.

00:41:21.996 --> 00:41:24.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We rejoice in his reputation.

00:41:24.765 --> 00:41:27.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve got it in the Scriptures,
and we can see it 

00:41:27.968 --> 00:41:30.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the organization today.

00:41:30.704 --> 00:41:34.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah takes delight
when we boast in him

00:41:34.708 --> 00:41:38.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in his provisions, in his justice,

00:41:38.245 --> 00:41:41.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his promises, and in his loyal love.

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:47.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you students of the 150th class of Gilead

00:41:47.521 --> 00:41:50.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(students, soon-to-be graduates,
I should add),

00:41:50.858 --> 00:41:55.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ve got a lot of reasons
to boast in Jehovah God.

00:41:55.029 --> 00:41:59.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you know that throughout his ministry,
Jesus boasted in Jehovah.

00:41:59.967 --> 00:42:03.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you examine closely the Scriptures
and things that Jesus said,

00:42:03.637 --> 00:42:06.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll be able to see on many occasions

00:42:06.173 --> 00:42:08.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how he boasted in Jehovah.

00:42:08.709 --> 00:42:10.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just to give you one example,

00:42:10.811 --> 00:42:14.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember when the rich young ruler
approached Jesus and he said:

00:42:14.081 --> 00:42:17.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[Oh,] Good Teacher”
to the Lord Jesus Christ?

00:42:17.551 --> 00:42:19.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what did Jesus say?

00:42:19.687 --> 00:42:23.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why do you call me good?

00:42:23.123 --> 00:42:27.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nobody is good except one, God.”

00:42:27.394 --> 00:42:30.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a wonderful boast

00:42:30.097 --> 00:42:33.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah God, glorifying him.

00:42:33.567 --> 00:42:35.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you students can boast in Jehovah

00:42:35.869 --> 00:42:37.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(you’ve been doing it for a long time)

00:42:37.972 --> 00:42:40.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because now you have

00:42:40.174 --> 00:42:43.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the privilege of going out,
fulfilling an assignment,

00:42:43.978 --> 00:42:48.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and showing how much
you really do rely on Jehovah God.

00:42:48.716 --> 00:42:52.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can boast because you’ve experienced
what Jesus declared

00:42:52.152 --> 00:42:55.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at John 8:32.

00:42:55.689 --> 00:42:59.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said: “And you will know the truth,
and the truth will set you free.”

00:42:59.593 --> 00:43:01.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s something we all know.

00:43:01.996 --> 00:43:04.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But don’t minimize it.

00:43:04.064 --> 00:43:07.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Appreciate the freedom you have right now

00:43:07.935 --> 00:43:10.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you know the truth.

00:43:10.271 --> 00:43:13.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve been set free
from the lies of this world

00:43:13.574 --> 00:43:18.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that hold people in bondage
about false beliefs in life and death.

00:43:18.545 --> 00:43:20.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re free from human thinking that man

00:43:20.881 --> 00:43:23.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is going to remedy
the problems of this old world,

00:43:23.417 --> 00:43:25.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we know they can’t do it.

00:43:25.419 --> 00:43:27.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They haven’t got the wherewithal to do it.

00:43:27.221 --> 00:43:31.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No man can really “direct his [own steps],”
not even a perfect man.

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:35.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can deliver his people too.

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:40.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even where we’re under severe persecution,

00:43:40.234 --> 00:43:44.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can intervene
whenever he sees fit to do so.

00:43:45.406 --> 00:43:49.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can boast also in another thing
—that you are slaves of Jehovah.

00:43:49.743 --> 00:43:52.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you’re in a unique position
because very few slaves

00:43:52.513 --> 00:43:55.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are allowed to choose their master,

00:43:55.215 --> 00:43:57.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you’ve done it.

00:43:57.217 --> 00:43:59.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve chosen Jehovah God

00:43:59.453 --> 00:44:02.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be your Master and to be a slave to him.

00:44:02.856 --> 00:44:05.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you know that Jehovah is with you.

00:44:05.659 --> 00:44:10.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’re happy, and you’re willing slaves
of Jehovah and of Jesus Christ.

00:44:10.164 --> 00:44:13.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s a remarkable slavery, really,

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:16.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because no one has the freedom

00:44:16.236 --> 00:44:19.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we enjoy in our slavery to Jehovah God.

00:44:19.973 --> 00:44:23.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re so free and able to do so many things

00:44:23.777 --> 00:44:26.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
serving Jehovah but all the while

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:31.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enjoying the good life
that God has given to us.

00:44:31.051 --> 00:44:33.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can boast also in the brotherhood,

00:44:33.854 --> 00:44:37.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you can gather together
in assemblies to praise Jehovah God.

00:44:37.191 --> 00:44:39.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you know Jesus’ words are true:

00:44:39.593 --> 00:44:41.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Two or three are gathered in his name.

00:44:41.762 --> 00:44:43.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There he is in our midst.’

00:44:43.197 --> 00:44:48.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So whether it’s tens of thousands
gathered together at a big convention

00:44:48.168 --> 00:44:52.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or two or three gathering together secretly,

00:44:52.072 --> 00:44:55.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know that Jesus Christ is there with you.

00:44:56.009 --> 00:44:59.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can also boast in the great privilege
you have through prayer.

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:01.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just think about it for a moment.

00:45:01.815 --> 00:45:06.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can talk to the almighty Creator
of the universe personally.

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:09.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is really something quite remarkable.

00:45:09.556 --> 00:45:11.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that is a privilege we have,

00:45:11.358 --> 00:45:13.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we boast in the privilege we have

00:45:13.894 --> 00:45:17.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of addressing Jehovah
and asking him for his help,

00:45:17.231 --> 00:45:20.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for his spirit to guide us,
for his strength and protection.

00:45:21.402 --> 00:45:23.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there’s something else too
that I find fascinating

00:45:23.971 --> 00:45:26.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you can boast in.

00:45:26.073 --> 00:45:28.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can boast because you bear

00:45:28.475 --> 00:45:32.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the fear-inspiring name
Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:45:32.646 --> 00:45:34.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about that.

00:45:34.648 --> 00:45:37.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re carrying Jehovah’s name.

00:45:37.317 --> 00:45:42.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how grateful, really,
we are that back in 1931

00:45:42.122 --> 00:45:44.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the visible part of Jehovah’s organization

00:45:44.992 --> 00:45:48.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
adopted the name Jehovah’s Witnesses!

00:45:48.128 --> 00:45:50.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s not just the name of a religion.

00:45:51.432 --> 00:45:54.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a description of what people do.

00:45:54.334 --> 00:45:57.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They live their lives to honor Jehovah God.

00:45:57.504 --> 00:46:01.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are living Witnesses of the Creator.

00:46:01.341 --> 00:46:03.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is a privilege that we have,

00:46:03.343 --> 00:46:06.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that separates us
from all religion on the earth.

00:46:06.914 --> 00:46:09.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there’s no other religion
that wants that name anyhow.

00:46:09.917 --> 00:46:13.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we’re delighted that we have it.

00:46:13.053 --> 00:46:17.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they regret, perhaps a few,
that they didn’t listen to or adopt it.

00:46:19.259 --> 00:46:24.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are God’s name people,
and at 1 Chronicles 16:10,

00:46:24.031 --> 00:46:28.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says this: “Boast about his holy name.

00:46:28.969 --> 00:46:32.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let the hearts of those
seeking Jehovah rejoice.”

00:46:32.873 --> 00:46:35.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you examine synonyms,

00:46:35.442 --> 00:46:38.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“rejoice” is a synonym in certain cases

00:46:38.979 --> 00:46:42.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for “boast”—to boast in Jehovah.

00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:45.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you can boast over the fact that Jehovah

00:46:45.586 --> 00:46:48.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has allowed you a very special privilege.

00:46:48.522 --> 00:46:52.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can see the unseen.

00:46:52.226 --> 00:46:54.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not all people can do that.

00:46:54.394 --> 00:46:56.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The vision of many people in this world

00:46:56.597 --> 00:47:00.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is limited to just the physical
that they see before them,

00:47:00.367 --> 00:47:02.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they can’t see the unseen.

00:47:02.903 --> 00:47:05.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember a man who said,

00:47:05.239 --> 00:47:07.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What has God ever done for me?”

00:47:08.575 --> 00:47:09.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That poor man.

00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:13.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was blind—totally blind spiritually.

00:47:13.247 --> 00:47:17.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He enjoyed food, drink,
the things the earth provides,

00:47:17.084 --> 00:47:20.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he couldn’t see
behind those physical things.

00:47:20.954 --> 00:47:24.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He couldn’t see
that there had to be a wonderful Creator

00:47:24.858 --> 00:47:28.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who provided all of these things for him.

00:47:29.663 --> 00:47:32.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can see the unseen.

00:47:32.666 --> 00:47:36.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see Jesus Christ ruling
as King in the heavens.

00:47:36.169 --> 00:47:38.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see the new world that’s coming.

00:47:38.272 --> 00:47:40.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see the resurrection of the dead.

00:47:40.807 --> 00:47:44.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see the functioning
of Jehovah God’s holy spirit

00:47:44.511 --> 00:47:46.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on his people today.

00:47:47.814 --> 00:47:50.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, you know very well

00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:54.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ve only touched
on a few things that you can boast in,

00:47:54.154 --> 00:47:58.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you’ll want to continue doing that
—boasting in Jehovah.

00:47:58.492 --> 00:48:01.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And right now, I know
(all of you students) you feel great.

00:48:01.695 --> 00:48:04.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve completed your course.
You’ve done it.

00:48:04.131 --> 00:48:06.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re graduating from Gilead School,

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:09.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now the doors of future activity

00:48:09.736 --> 00:48:12.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are swinging open to you.

00:48:12.506 --> 00:48:16.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as you undertake your assignments,

00:48:16.176 --> 00:48:20.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whatever and wherever they may be,

00:48:20.113 --> 00:48:22.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do these things, please:

00:48:22.883 --> 00:48:24.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay humble,

00:48:24.952 --> 00:48:27.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be happy,

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:29.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and work hard.

00:48:29.089 --> 00:48:31.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And always esteem highly

00:48:31.792 --> 00:48:34.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the great honor and privilege you have

00:48:34.828 --> 00:48:37.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “boast in Jehovah.”

00:48:45.939 --> 00:48:47.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks.

00:48:47.441 --> 00:48:48.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks, Bill.

00:48:48.442 --> 00:48:51.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As usual, we thoroughly enjoyed your talk.

00:48:52.446 --> 00:48:55.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, our second prerecorded interview

00:48:55.549 --> 00:48:59.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a Gilead graduate now in his assignment

00:48:59.052 --> 00:49:03.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
takes us to Ecuador, South America.

00:49:03.123 --> 00:49:06.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This brother serves
on the Branch Committee in Ecuador,

00:49:06.727 --> 00:49:11.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he graduated
from the 142nd class of Gilead.

00:49:12.633 --> 00:49:14.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice as he explains

00:49:14.801 --> 00:49:16.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(notice) the positive impact

00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:19.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Gilead graduates had on him

00:49:19.439 --> 00:49:21.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from his childhood

00:49:21.475 --> 00:49:23.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how his training while at Gilead

00:49:23.977 --> 00:49:28.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped him to appreciate
what is truly important.

00:49:30.851 --> 00:49:33.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother and Sister Tapia
will be going back to Ecuador.

00:49:35.889 --> 00:49:37.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gilead training is a beautiful way

00:49:37.891 --> 00:49:39.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is using divine education

00:49:39.693 --> 00:49:41.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to train people

00:49:41.228 --> 00:49:43.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not only for their benefit.

00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:45.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By having Gilead graduates

00:49:45.098 --> 00:49:46.400 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
all around the world,

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:49.202 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we are sharing the impact of this school

00:49:49.202 --> 00:49:51.438 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on the brothers and sisters who are working

00:49:51.438 --> 00:49:54.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with these students and future graduates.

00:49:54.307 --> 00:49:55.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was Gilead missionaries

00:49:55.942 --> 00:49:58.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who first introduced the truth to my parents

00:49:58.145 --> 00:50:00.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helped them to the point of baptism.

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I have very pleasant memories

00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:07.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Gilead graduates
being around my home since childhood.

00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:10.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The greatest legacy
I received through my Gilead training

00:50:10.757 --> 00:50:12.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the privilege of getting to know

00:50:12.759 --> 00:50:15.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s beautiful personality more deeply.

00:50:15.729 --> 00:50:18.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have been studying
the Bible since childhood,

00:50:18.331 --> 00:50:21.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but doing so with the help
of the Gilead instructors

00:50:21.768 --> 00:50:24.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really helped me to make connections

00:50:24.104 --> 00:50:26.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I had never put together before.

00:50:26.907 --> 00:50:29.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t go to Gilead to learn abilities,

00:50:29.142 --> 00:50:32.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which can sometimes overshadow
spiritual qualities.

00:50:32.713 --> 00:50:36.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, a very important part
of Gilead training

00:50:36.416 --> 00:50:39.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the study of Christ’s personality.

00:50:39.152 --> 00:50:41.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you know, Jesus is mostly remembered

00:50:41.655 --> 00:50:43.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not so much for his abilities

00:50:43.757 --> 00:50:46.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but for how he perfectly reflected

00:50:46.159 --> 00:50:48.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the beautiful qualities of his father.

00:50:48.762 --> 00:50:51.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By getting to know Jehovah and Jesus better,

00:50:51.965 --> 00:50:55.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to better see
where I need to improve.

00:50:55.702 --> 00:50:58.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, it can be discouraging at times

00:50:58.271 --> 00:51:00.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to not always act as they do,

00:51:00.407 --> 00:51:01.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that has helped me

00:51:01.875 --> 00:51:05.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have the proper perspective
and to rely on Jehovah,

00:51:05.212 --> 00:51:08.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
begging him for his guidance
while waiting for his help.

00:51:08.915 --> 00:51:12.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the best lessons
I took away from Gilead is

00:51:12.185 --> 00:51:17.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that people are more important
than tasks or deadlines.

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:21.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People are the reason for our assignment,

00:51:21.027 --> 00:51:24.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that is why I need to show my love
to my brothers and sisters.

00:51:24.998 --> 00:51:29.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Honestly, I don’t feel at all qualified
for this assignment,

00:51:29.336 --> 00:51:32.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I have learned
that if Jehovah assigns us a certain task,

00:51:32.973 --> 00:51:36.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for sure he will give us
what we need to accomplish it.

00:51:42.249 --> 00:51:43.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was very nice.

00:51:43.583 --> 00:51:45.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We certainly appreciate it.

00:51:45.085 --> 00:51:49.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we have one
of the Gilead instructors next,

00:51:49.189 --> 00:51:51.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother James Cauthon.

00:51:53.093 --> 00:51:55.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he’s chosen as his subject

00:51:55.595 --> 00:51:58.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Thriving in the Trenches.”

00:51:59.866 --> 00:52:04.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Located in the western Pacific Ocean,

00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:09.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Mariana Trench
is the deepest known location on earth.

00:52:09.075 --> 00:52:12.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To help you get an idea of its depth,

00:52:12.546 --> 00:52:14.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imagine that you could stack

00:52:14.247 --> 00:52:15.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Empire State Building

00:52:15.949 --> 00:52:17.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the trench.

00:52:17.984 --> 00:52:21.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would take 25 such buildings to go

00:52:21.655 --> 00:52:25.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the bottom of the trench
before you would reach sea level.

00:52:26.359 --> 00:52:30.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is also one of the deadliest places
on earth.

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:31.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is that?

00:52:31.832 --> 00:52:34.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a word—pressure.

00:52:34.501 --> 00:52:37.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The crushing pressure, water pressure,

00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:41.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the floor of the trench
is more than eight tons per square inch.

00:52:41.808 --> 00:52:43.310 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, to give you some idea,

00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:44.411 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that would be the equivalent

00:52:44.411 --> 00:52:48.415 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of having about 50 jumbo jets

00:52:48.415 --> 00:52:50.450 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on top of you.

00:52:51.284 --> 00:52:55.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Surely no life could live in that trench.

00:52:55.522 --> 00:52:58.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At least that’s what scientists thought.

00:52:58.825 --> 00:53:00.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they were wrong.

00:53:00.827 --> 00:53:02.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they finally developed a submersible

00:53:02.829 --> 00:53:05.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would take them down into the trench,

00:53:05.198 --> 00:53:09.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they found life teeming

00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:13.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and not just surviving but thriving.

00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:17.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how is that possible?

00:53:17.043 --> 00:53:21.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s possible, friends,
because Jehovah, our Creator,

00:53:21.615 --> 00:53:25.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knows how to deal with pressure.

00:53:25.085 --> 00:53:28.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah knows how to deal with pressure.

00:53:28.989 --> 00:53:32.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is a fact
that should be comforting to all of us.

00:53:32.192 --> 00:53:33.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:36.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because the pressure

00:53:36.029 --> 00:53:38.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this system of things is increasing

00:53:38.498 --> 00:53:41.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—strain, stress, anxiety—

00:53:41.268 --> 00:53:43.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all people at all levels.

00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:45.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Bible tells us

00:53:45.405 --> 00:53:49.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that these pressures are likely
to increase in the near future.

00:53:49.342 --> 00:53:51.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the good news is

00:53:51.011 --> 00:53:55.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah does more than
just equip his servants to survive.

00:53:55.715 --> 00:53:59.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can actually make one thrive.

00:53:59.719 --> 00:54:01.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s an example.

00:54:01.721 --> 00:54:04.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try this on for pressure.

00:54:05.258 --> 00:54:08.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re surrounded by men who hate you.

00:54:08.528 --> 00:54:12.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition to hunting you down
with a view to taking your life,

00:54:12.299 --> 00:54:16.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’ve spread slander and lies
about you everywhere.

00:54:16.903 --> 00:54:20.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your name has become a reproach.

00:54:20.073 --> 00:54:24.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When people see you coming,
they turn and run the other way

00:54:24.411 --> 00:54:26.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they feel that your time is short

00:54:26.913 --> 00:54:31.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they don’t want to be caught
in the crosshairs.

00:54:31.217 --> 00:54:35.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wherever you look,
it seems like terror is waiting for you.

00:54:35.989 --> 00:54:40.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as a result of these problems,
you’re struggling with depression.

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:42.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your own sins are staring you in the face.

00:54:42.896 --> 00:54:45.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The whole experience
has taken a toll on your health.

00:54:45.665 --> 00:54:46.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t sleep.

00:54:46.833 --> 00:54:48.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your stamina is shot.

00:54:48.435 --> 00:54:50.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your body is wasting away.

00:54:52.238 --> 00:54:55.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that was David’s situation,

00:54:55.942 --> 00:55:00.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you can read about it at Psalm 31:10-13.

00:55:01.281 --> 00:55:04.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The pressure was real
—no question about it.

00:55:04.384 --> 00:55:09.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David’s feelings were real
—no question about that.

00:55:09.356 --> 00:55:12.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But something else was very real.

00:55:12.492 --> 00:55:15.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was Jehovah.

00:55:15.362 --> 00:55:20.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so Jehovah
was where David would turn to.

00:55:20.333 --> 00:55:24.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn to his words in Psalm 31.

00:55:26.272 --> 00:55:30.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 31—and note his humble prayer

00:55:30.276 --> 00:55:32.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beginning in verse 14.

00:55:33.279 --> 00:55:37.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “But I trust in you, O Jehovah,

00:55:37.083 --> 00:55:40.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I declare: ‘You are my God.’

00:55:40.453 --> 00:55:42.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My days are in your hand.

00:55:42.455 --> 00:55:46.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Rescue me from the hand of my enemies
and from those persecuting me.

00:55:46.593 --> 00:55:49.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Make your face shine upon your servant.

00:55:49.496 --> 00:55:52.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Save me by your loyal love.”

00:55:54.634 --> 00:55:57.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David’s life experiences

00:55:57.103 --> 00:56:00.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had taught him the value of turning to God

00:56:00.006 --> 00:56:03.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pouring out his heart in times of trial.

00:56:03.076 --> 00:56:07.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he absolutely knew that prayer,

00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:11.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
coupled with implicit trust and patience,

00:56:11.284 --> 00:56:13.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would always bring Jehovah’s blessing.

00:56:14.721 --> 00:56:19.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you see, friends,
the key to not just surviving

00:56:19.125 --> 00:56:22.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but thriving under extreme pressure

00:56:22.228 --> 00:56:25.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to have the internal pressure

00:56:25.265 --> 00:56:28.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
equal to the external.

00:56:28.468 --> 00:56:30.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when this is true,

00:56:30.603 --> 00:56:35.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is no amount of pressure
that can crush you.

00:56:35.041 --> 00:56:37.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in a spiritual sense,

00:56:37.377 --> 00:56:41.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David received the internal fortitude
or, as some say,

00:56:41.681 --> 00:56:44.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the intestinal fortitude,”

00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:46.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meaning “the courage and the strength

00:56:46.419 --> 00:56:50.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would make him equal
to the pressure weighing in on him.”

00:56:50.457 --> 00:56:53.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how do we know that he received that?

00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:56.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s go back to Psalm 31
for just a moment.

00:56:57.430 --> 00:57:01.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you look in verse 21, notice now

00:57:01.267 --> 00:57:03.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the change.

00:57:03.603 --> 00:57:06.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “May Jehovah be praised,

00:57:06.606 --> 00:57:11.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for in a wonderful way,
he has shown his loyal love to me

00:57:11.111 --> 00:57:13.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a besieged city.”

00:57:13.346 --> 00:57:15.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in verse 23:

00:57:15.815 --> 00:57:19.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Love Jehovah, all you who are loyal to him!

00:57:19.018 --> 00:57:21.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah protects the faithful.”

00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:23.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally in verse 24:

00:57:23.223 --> 00:57:26.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be courageous, and may your heart be strong,

00:57:26.826 --> 00:57:30.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all you who are waiting for Jehovah.”

00:57:32.065 --> 00:57:36.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, you see, David

00:57:36.569 --> 00:57:39.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
received an answer to his prayer

00:57:39.873 --> 00:57:43.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his prayer coupled with his faith

00:57:43.676 --> 00:57:45.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his patience.

00:57:45.678 --> 00:57:47.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was waiting on Jehovah.

00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:52.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah helped him not only to survive
but to thrive.

00:57:52.418 --> 00:57:55.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he added joy to David

00:57:55.822 --> 00:57:59.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because David went on
to find joy and happiness

00:57:59.692 --> 00:58:03.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his responsibilities and privileges.

00:58:03.396 --> 00:58:05.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we learn?

00:58:05.398 --> 00:58:09.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) David was able to face the pressure

00:58:09.402 --> 00:58:13.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he had
an unshakable faith in Jehovah,

00:58:13.473 --> 00:58:17.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) David’s relationship with Jehovah

00:58:17.177 --> 00:58:21.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brought him the patience to wait on God,

00:58:21.447 --> 00:58:25.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and (3) when a loyal servant of God

00:58:25.018 --> 00:58:27.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
humbly turns to Jehovah for help,

00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:30.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is Jehovah’s own loyal love

00:58:30.623 --> 00:58:34.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that has the effect
of equalizing the pressure.

00:58:35.628 --> 00:58:38.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, you know, there’s something else.

00:58:38.565 --> 00:58:43.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David’s experience in the trench
 reached further than he ever knew.

00:58:44.837 --> 00:58:48.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jonah, while in the belly of the great fish,

00:58:48.641 --> 00:58:52.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cited words from Psalm 31.

00:58:52.512 --> 00:58:57.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah, who had
many trialsome times in his life,

00:58:57.517 --> 00:59:01.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
often echoed phrases from Psalm 31.

00:59:01.955 --> 00:59:06.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jesus Christ himself,
the very Son of God—

00:59:06.326 --> 00:59:08.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His final words from the stake

00:59:08.628 --> 00:59:12.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were a quotation from Psalm 31:5.

00:59:12.098 --> 00:59:15.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jesus must have meditated
on this many times.

00:59:15.935 --> 00:59:19.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so, friends, like David, Jonah, Jeremiah,

00:59:19.272 --> 00:59:22.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus, and many, many others

00:59:22.442 --> 00:59:24.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they all trusted in Jehovah,

00:59:24.744 --> 00:59:29.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah never failed
to make them equal to the pressure.

00:59:29.616 --> 00:59:32.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll do the same for you.

00:59:32.252 --> 00:59:34.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so in conclusion,

00:59:34.687 --> 00:59:38.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you see, it really doesn’t matter

00:59:38.291 --> 00:59:40.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how great the pressure is.

00:59:40.293 --> 00:59:43.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It only matters where the pressure lies.

00:59:43.896 --> 00:59:47.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not let it come between you

00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:51.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah
and your worship and service.

00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:53.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t let it come between you,

00:59:53.773 --> 00:59:56.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because then the external pressure

00:59:56.843 --> 01:00:00.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will only continue to move you closer

01:00:00.413 --> 01:00:03.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to your heavenly Father.

01:00:03.383 --> 01:00:07.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The life that flourishes
in the Mariana Trench gives

01:00:07.553 --> 01:00:10.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a positive example, a beautiful example,

01:00:10.556 --> 01:00:13.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s limitless ability
to help his creation

01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:15.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
deal with pressure.

01:00:15.662 --> 01:00:17.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prayer, trust, and patience

01:00:17.997 --> 01:00:21.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will always be rewarded by Jehovah.

01:00:21.634 --> 01:00:24.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Relief will come.

01:00:24.304 --> 01:00:27.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So remain close to your heavenly Father,

01:00:27.073 --> 01:00:30.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will not just survive

01:00:30.209 --> 01:00:33.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the pressure in the trench

01:00:33.212 --> 01:00:35.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you will thrive spiritually.

01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:47.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Cauthon,
for your nice, insightful comments

01:00:47.126 --> 01:00:49.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—much appreciated.

01:00:49.128 --> 01:00:51.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, our third interview involves a brother

01:00:51.798 --> 01:00:54.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who serves as a member
of the Branch Committee

01:00:54.701 --> 01:00:56.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Sri Lanka.

01:00:56.903 --> 01:01:01.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He graduated from the 146th class of Gilead

01:01:01.874 --> 01:01:04.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so just four classes back.

01:01:04.644 --> 01:01:06.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen carefully as he explains

01:01:06.779 --> 01:01:11.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how Gilead training helped him
to see things about his personality

01:01:11.751 --> 01:01:14.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he needed to refine

01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:18.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to become a stabilizing
and strengthening influence

01:01:18.491 --> 01:01:20.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his branch territory.

01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:25.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother and Sister Sivakumaran
will be returning to Sri Lanka.

01:01:28.835 --> 01:01:30.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Gilead, the wonderful thing

01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:32.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that you get to learn
from the beginning

01:01:32.739 --> 01:01:34.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s dealings with humankind,

01:01:34.607 --> 01:01:36.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that vast history.

01:01:36.075 --> 01:01:37.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Learning that is humbling.

01:01:39.379 --> 01:01:41.414 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
How tiny I am

01:01:41.414 --> 01:01:43.449 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the small role that I play

01:01:43.449 --> 01:01:45.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s organization are a realization!

01:01:45.818 --> 01:01:50.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before going to Gilead,
I thought I was a loving person,

01:01:50.189 --> 01:01:53.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we always think
we want to be loving people.

01:01:53.159 --> 01:01:56.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But during Gilead,
it was made aware to me

01:01:56.629 --> 01:01:59.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I had a spiritual blind spot.

01:01:59.332 --> 01:02:02.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were brothers and sisters
that I didn’t really notice before,

01:02:04.971 --> 01:02:07.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that kind of taught me
an important lesson.

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not about giving talks,

01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:15.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but really it’s personal attention
that brothers need.

01:02:15.081 --> 01:02:17.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I need to give them my time,

01:02:17.216 --> 01:02:19.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I need to help them understand

01:02:19.318 --> 01:02:22.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah loves them very much.

01:02:22.955 --> 01:02:27.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, one word that stands out
throughout the training is “mercy.”

01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:29.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Israel made many mistakes,

01:02:29.295 --> 01:02:31.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah never picked on them
for their mistakes.

01:02:31.597 --> 01:02:35.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He just wanted them to come back to him,
and that was a lovely lesson.

01:02:35.268 --> 01:02:39.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As an overseer,
I need to ask a question that always,

01:02:39.639 --> 01:02:41.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know, rings in my my ear,

01:02:41.941 --> 01:02:45.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Am I going to criticize,
or am I going to commend?’

01:02:45.378 --> 01:02:48.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just to give you an example,
before going to Gilead,

01:02:48.581 --> 01:02:52.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a home overseer
I was strict

01:02:52.251 --> 01:02:55.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and came across stingy,
to be honest.

01:02:55.488 --> 01:02:58.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But during Gilead,
it was made well aware to me

01:02:58.624 --> 01:03:00.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I need to change.

01:03:00.426 --> 01:03:02.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to be more generous,

01:03:02.662 --> 01:03:04.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I need to be merciful.

01:03:04.897 --> 01:03:07.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I vividly remember that one instructor said:

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:11.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Saying no to everything can be addictive,

01:03:11.637 --> 01:03:13.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it makes for an easy way out.”

01:03:13.639 --> 01:03:18.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we were admonished
to say yes whenever we can

01:03:18.344 --> 01:03:20.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to help the brothers.

01:03:20.713 --> 01:03:24.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Summing up Gilead,
I can’t do better than Jesus.

01:03:24.283 --> 01:03:27.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Love Jehovah; love people

01:03:27.753 --> 01:03:29.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s the whole training of Gilead.

01:03:29.856 --> 01:03:31.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some of my feelings

01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:36.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every time I think about Gilead

01:03:36.295 --> 01:03:40.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are that I have a long way to go
to put all those details into practice

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:43.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to change myself to fit Jehovah.

01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:46.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, yeah, I have a long way to go,
so I’m working on it.

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:58.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we pray that all
of you soon-to-be graduates

01:03:58.384 --> 01:04:01.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
examine yourself to ensure

01:04:01.153 --> 01:04:05.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’ll have a strengthening effect
on the brotherhood.

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:08.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was nice, the humble expressions
he shared with us.

01:04:08.461 --> 01:04:12.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s turn our attention
to another one of the Gilead instructors

01:04:12.965 --> 01:04:16.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a helper to the Teaching Committee,
Mark Noumair.

01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:19.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The title of his talk is

01:04:19.472 --> 01:04:24.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I Cling to You; You Hold on to Me.’”

01:04:24.243 --> 01:04:26.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Noumair.

01:04:28.347 --> 01:04:32.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this talk, we want you to understand

01:04:32.718 --> 01:04:37.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the sustaining power of loyal love.

01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:40.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because it is this quality, loyal love,

01:04:40.459 --> 01:04:42.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its power

01:04:42.528 --> 01:04:46.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will help you face future trials

01:04:46.032 --> 01:04:50.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and challenges with confidence in Jehovah.

01:04:50.469 --> 01:04:53.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you perhaps remember the definition

01:04:53.639 --> 01:04:56.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of loyal love from a written review.

01:04:56.409 --> 01:05:00.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s this: It is love motivated

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:04.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by a strong commitment and a deep attachment.

01:05:04.784 --> 01:05:06.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here’s how King David described

01:05:06.986 --> 01:05:11.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the loyal love that existed
between him and Jehovah.

01:05:11.257 --> 01:05:14.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said at Psalm 63:8:

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:16.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I cling to you;

01:05:16.529 --> 01:05:20.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your right hand keeps fast hold on me.”

01:05:20.499 --> 01:05:23.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is loyal love,

01:05:23.269 --> 01:05:25.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I cling to you.

01:05:25.271 --> 01:05:28.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You hold on to me.’

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in the first century
—a woman—

01:05:30.977 --> 01:05:33.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a woman who set an outstanding example

01:05:33.679 --> 01:05:37.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of clinging to Jehovah is Anna.

01:05:37.817 --> 01:05:40.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?
Let’s find out.

01:05:40.453 --> 01:05:43.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We open our Bibles to Luke chapter 2.

01:05:43.556 --> 01:05:46.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to read verses 36 and 37

01:05:46.726 --> 01:05:51.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see what lesson
we can learn and apply to you:

01:05:53.866 --> 01:05:55.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now there was a prophetess,

01:05:55.468 --> 01:05:58.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Anna the daughter
of Phanuel, of Asher’s tribe.

01:05:58.971 --> 01:06:01.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This woman was well along in years

01:06:01.207 --> 01:06:05.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and had lived with her husband
for seven years after they were married,

01:06:05.544 --> 01:06:09.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and she was a widow now 84 years old.

01:06:09.382 --> 01:06:11.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“She was never missing from the temple,

01:06:11.884 --> 01:06:14.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“rendering sacred service night and day

01:06:14.954 --> 01:06:17.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with fasting and supplications.”

01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:19.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, here we have it.

01:06:19.792 --> 01:06:23.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything we know about Anna is right here.

01:06:23.629 --> 01:06:25.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Luke recorded it.

01:06:25.931 --> 01:06:28.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was 84 years old

01:06:28.534 --> 01:06:31.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Luke introduces her to us.

01:06:31.771 --> 01:06:36.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likely, she hadn’t lived long enough
to become a follower of Jesus,

01:06:36.475 --> 01:06:39.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be anointed with holy spirit,

01:06:39.011 --> 01:06:42.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to enjoy preaching
the good news of the Kingdom.

01:06:42.148 --> 01:06:44.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s it.

01:06:44.216 --> 01:06:47.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>If</i>  we stop right there.

01:06:47.887 --> 01:06:49.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if we don’t?

01:06:49.989 --> 01:06:52.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if we dig deeper?

01:06:52.358 --> 01:06:55.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will we learn that will help you?

01:06:55.094 --> 01:06:57.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s do that.

01:06:57.863 --> 01:07:01.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anna was born about 86 B.C.E.

01:07:03.302 --> 01:07:06.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When she was 23 years old,

01:07:06.038 --> 01:07:10.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jerusalem was filled
with violence and divisions.

01:07:10.776 --> 01:07:13.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jewish leaders
such as the Maccabees are at war.

01:07:13.713 --> 01:07:17.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Roman forces under the leadership
of a soldier named Pompey

01:07:17.383 --> 01:07:20.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came to restore order, and in the process,

01:07:20.252 --> 01:07:24.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some 12,000 Jews reportedly died.

01:07:24.924 --> 01:07:28.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is possible that Anna’s husband

01:07:28.394 --> 01:07:30.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was one of these victims.

01:07:31.530 --> 01:07:34.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then when Anna was 47 years old,

01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:37.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Romans appointed Herod as king of Judea.

01:07:37.603 --> 01:07:39.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Herod?

01:07:39.305 --> 01:07:41.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This man was not a descendant of David.

01:07:41.474 --> 01:07:43.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was not even an Israelite.

01:07:43.476 --> 01:07:45.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was an Edomite.

01:07:45.511 --> 01:07:49.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Edomites
were sworn enemies of true worship.

01:07:49.849 --> 01:07:54.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, on top of that,
the hypocritical Jewish religious leaders

01:07:54.553 --> 01:07:59.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made life hard for people,
including widows like Anna.

01:07:59.558 --> 01:08:03.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now Anna watches
as Jehovah’s “house of prayer,”

01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:08.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the place she cherished,
became “a cave of robbers.”

01:08:08.467 --> 01:08:12.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pure worship is withering on the vine.

01:08:12.538 --> 01:08:14.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will Anna do?

01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:16.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She could have been stumbled.

01:08:16.609 --> 01:08:21.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She could have reasoned:
‘I supported true worship all my life.

01:08:21.447 --> 01:08:25.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I believed the Messiah would come
and the prophecies would come.

01:08:25.918 --> 01:08:27.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I go to the temple every day.

01:08:27.987 --> 01:08:31.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’ve done everything right,
but things have only gotten worse.

01:08:31.690 --> 01:08:36.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘God let my husband die;
an Edomite is rebuilding the temple.

01:08:36.128 --> 01:08:38.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What’s happening?

01:08:38.130 --> 01:08:40.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Has Jehovah left us?

01:08:40.332 --> 01:08:42.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should I leave too?’

01:08:43.569 --> 01:08:46.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anna could have given up,
walked away, became bitter.

01:08:46.739 --> 01:08:48.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But she didn’t.

01:08:48.741 --> 01:08:51.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why? Why?

01:08:51.310 --> 01:08:54.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the roots of her loyal love,

01:08:54.647 --> 01:08:56.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that sustaining power of loyal love.

01:08:56.982 --> 01:09:00.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It went deep, and it wrapped around Jehovah.

01:09:00.119 --> 01:09:03.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she had the power to keep clinging to him

01:09:03.122 --> 01:09:05.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under those circumstances.

01:09:05.624 --> 01:09:09.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anna was determined to serve Jehovah
to the best of her ability.

01:09:10.462 --> 01:09:11.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did she do?

01:09:11.664 --> 01:09:15.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, looking at verse 37:

01:09:15.901 --> 01:09:19.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“She was never missing from the temple,

01:09:19.238 --> 01:09:21.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[She was in the right place.]

01:09:23.309 --> 01:09:26.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“rendering sacred service night and day

01:09:26.645 --> 01:09:29.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[doing the right thing]

01:09:29.315 --> 01:09:31.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with fasting and supplications

01:09:31.851 --> 01:09:34.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[with the right attitude].”

01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:37.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was doing the right thing

01:09:37.723 --> 01:09:41.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the right place with the right attitude.

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:45.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nothing could stop
this seemingly fragile servant of God

01:09:45.464 --> 01:09:48.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from clinging to her closest Friend, Jehovah.

01:09:49.735 --> 01:09:52.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In effect, Anna was saying,

01:09:52.438 --> 01:09:56.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I cling to you, Jehovah.”

01:09:56.175 --> 01:09:59.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And her loyal love was noticed.

01:10:00.779 --> 01:10:03.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chapter 2 and verse 38

01:10:03.415 --> 01:10:06.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reveals that Anna was present

01:10:06.552 --> 01:10:10.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the baby Jesus
was brought to the temple.

01:10:10.422 --> 01:10:15.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when she saw that baby,
what did she begin to do in verse 38?

01:10:15.227 --> 01:10:19.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “She came near
and [she] began giving thanks to God

01:10:19.531 --> 01:10:22.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and speaking about the child
to all who were waiting

01:10:22.501 --> 01:10:25.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Jerusalem’s deliverance.”

01:10:25.037 --> 01:10:27.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you sense her joy?

01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:31.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you feel the joy she had
at seeing and, perhaps, even holding

01:10:31.410 --> 01:10:33.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that little baby, the future Messiah?

01:10:33.946 --> 01:10:36.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was something that this elderly woman

01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:40.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had never expected in her lifetime.

01:10:40.185 --> 01:10:43.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The child in front of her was proof

01:10:43.856 --> 01:10:46.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—tangible proof, concrete evidence—

01:10:46.959 --> 01:10:51.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah had not abandoned his people.

01:10:51.497 --> 01:10:55.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he did not abandon Anna.

01:10:55.234 --> 01:10:59.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So not only had Anna clung to Jehovah

01:10:59.638 --> 01:11:04.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah held on to her and

01:11:04.643 --> 01:11:08.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—<i>and</i>  rewarded her.

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:11.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is loyal love.

01:11:12.985 --> 01:11:15.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anna’s faithful record

01:11:15.921 --> 01:11:18.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is so well-known

01:11:18.457 --> 01:11:22.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that some 50 years later,
50 years later or so,

01:11:22.928 --> 01:11:25.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Luke was compelled to write about her.

01:11:25.965 --> 01:11:28.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where did he get his information?

01:11:28.033 --> 01:11:29.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who did he talk to?

01:11:29.868 --> 01:11:33.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he talk to Mary or interview her
or some of the older ones?

01:11:33.339 --> 01:11:35.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘There was this woman, Anna.
She was at the temple.

01:11:35.941 --> 01:11:37.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She would never leave.’

01:11:37.743 --> 01:11:39.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t know.

01:11:39.745 --> 01:11:44.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what we do know is
that Jehovah inspired Luke

01:11:44.383 --> 01:11:48.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to record and to document
her life in His Word

01:11:48.654 --> 01:11:52.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we could be taught lessons.

01:11:52.291 --> 01:11:55.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here we are some 2,000 years later,

01:11:55.928 --> 01:11:59.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we are using her life as an example

01:11:59.298 --> 01:12:02.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of commitment and unbreakable integrity

01:12:02.668 --> 01:12:04.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you students to imitate.

01:12:06.105 --> 01:12:09.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what can you learn from Anna’s example?

01:12:12.044 --> 01:12:15.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may suffer loss of one kind or another.

01:12:15.614 --> 01:12:19.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will come face-to-face
with the imperfections of others.

01:12:19.718 --> 01:12:22.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your feelings may get hurt,

01:12:22.254 --> 01:12:25.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might find yourself coping
with an unexpected change

01:12:25.524 --> 01:12:28.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your life that is not pleasant,

01:12:28.427 --> 01:12:31.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or you may feel that you’re a victim

01:12:31.296 --> 01:12:34.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of an injustice or a serious misunderstanding

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:37.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from within the organization.

01:12:37.202 --> 01:12:39.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will you do?

01:12:39.405 --> 01:12:42.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what you will do.

01:12:42.007 --> 01:12:44.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will cling to Jehovah,

01:12:44.410 --> 01:12:47.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will experience him
holding on to you.

01:12:47.346 --> 01:12:49.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You cling to him.

01:12:49.048 --> 01:12:51.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He holds on to you.

01:12:51.683 --> 01:12:53.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

01:12:53.752 --> 01:12:57.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I recall a time when a brother
serving in a foreign field

01:12:57.589 --> 01:13:02.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of a misunderstanding
lost his privileges as an elder.

01:13:02.561 --> 01:13:04.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he felt the decision was unfair.

01:13:04.763 --> 01:13:06.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was deeply hurt.

01:13:06.932 --> 01:13:11.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But his wife— He and his wife
never stopped clinging to Jehovah

01:13:11.203 --> 01:13:14.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their spiritual routine.

01:13:14.473 --> 01:13:16.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then at a regional convention,

01:13:16.241 --> 01:13:19.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a brother approached him
and thanked him for the talk

01:13:19.078 --> 01:13:22.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he gave on the program.

01:13:22.014 --> 01:13:24.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he volunteered
in the cleaning department,

01:13:24.917 --> 01:13:27.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he hadn’t given a talk.

01:13:27.619 --> 01:13:30.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then the brother
now said to this former elder:

01:13:30.956 --> 01:13:34.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When I see your smile and positive attitude,

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:37.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“yes, you gave a talk.

01:13:37.029 --> 01:13:39.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And it was on loyalty,

01:13:39.098 --> 01:13:41.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was loud and clear.”

01:13:43.235 --> 01:13:45.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the former elder now relates this:

01:13:45.671 --> 01:13:48.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The experience taught me and my wife

01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:50.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that every challenge or misfortune

01:13:50.943 --> 01:13:53.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“does not need to represent a threat

01:13:53.912 --> 01:13:57.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to our spiritual well-being.

01:13:57.116 --> 01:13:59.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We’ve come to view rejection, failure,

01:13:59.418 --> 01:14:02.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or being misunderstood as normal episodes

01:14:02.988 --> 01:14:06.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the lives of competent, healthy people.

01:14:06.525 --> 01:14:10.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of being crushed, we grew.”

01:14:10.562 --> 01:14:15.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, the couple looked
beyond their hardships,

01:14:15.134 --> 01:14:17.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they clung to Jehovah.

01:14:17.970 --> 01:14:19.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

01:14:19.138 --> 01:14:22.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By imitating Anna.

01:14:22.407 --> 01:14:26.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were ‘never missing from true worship

01:14:26.979 --> 01:14:29.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘[in the right place],

01:14:29.781 --> 01:14:33.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘rendering sacred service day and night

01:14:33.051 --> 01:14:35.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘[doing the right thing]

01:14:35.754 --> 01:14:37.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with fasting and supplications.’

01:14:37.956 --> 01:14:42.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And sometimes
those supplications involve tears

01:14:42.094 --> 01:14:45.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but with the right attitude.

01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:50.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah held on to them and never let go.

01:14:50.202 --> 01:14:53.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brother is still serving
in the foreign field.

01:14:53.438 --> 01:14:55.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is an elder again

01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:58.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and giving memorable talks.

01:15:00.879 --> 01:15:05.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we want you
to remember from this talk?

01:15:06.618 --> 01:15:09.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want you to remember this:

01:15:09.555 --> 01:15:14.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you come face-to-face with future trials
(and you will)

01:15:14.459 --> 01:15:19.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or challenges in your life
(and you will, this is what happens in life),

01:15:22.801 --> 01:15:25.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be in the right place,

01:15:25.504 --> 01:15:28.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do the right thing

01:15:28.106 --> 01:15:30.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the right attitude.

01:15:30.576 --> 01:15:33.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By doing this, you declare:

01:15:33.512 --> 01:15:36.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah, I cling to you,

01:15:36.481 --> 01:15:39.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I trust you to hold on to me.”

01:15:47.459 --> 01:15:50.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much, Brother Noumair.

01:15:50.295 --> 01:15:53.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anna is a beautiful example
for all of us.

01:15:53.665 --> 01:15:55.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt about it.

01:15:55.667 --> 01:16:00.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, our final prerecorded interview takes us

01:16:00.205 --> 01:16:03.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the West African country of Ghana,

01:16:03.475 --> 01:16:07.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where David and Lynne Jones
currently serve.

01:16:07.746 --> 01:16:11.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Upon their graduation from the 95th class

01:16:11.550 --> 01:16:14.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in September of 1993,

01:16:14.052 --> 01:16:17.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were assigned
to the country of Kenya, East Africa.

01:16:17.956 --> 01:16:21.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They also served in Burundi for eight years.

01:16:21.193 --> 01:16:23.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Presently, they serve in Ghana,

01:16:23.962 --> 01:16:28.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Brother Jones serves
as a member of the Branch Committee there.

01:16:28.567 --> 01:16:32.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you might remember this couple
when you see the video

01:16:32.104 --> 01:16:34.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because their class was highlighted

01:16:34.806 --> 01:16:38.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the video <i>To the Ends of the Earth,</i>

01:16:38.377 --> 01:16:40.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which marked the 50th anniversary

01:16:40.679 --> 01:16:43.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.

01:16:43.682 --> 01:16:48.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a very enlightening video for sure.

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:51.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although the purpose
of Gilead School training

01:16:51.456 --> 01:16:53.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has changed since then,

01:16:53.892 --> 01:16:57.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s clear from their heartfelt comments

01:16:57.396 --> 01:17:02.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they’ve proven to be
a stabilizing and strengthening influence

01:17:02.167 --> 01:17:04.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where they have served.

01:17:04.169 --> 01:17:06.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So enjoy the video.

01:17:09.775 --> 01:17:12.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the day when we hand out assignments

01:17:12.244 --> 01:17:13.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to all of these students.

01:17:13.912 --> 01:17:15.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The morning that we knew
we were going to get our assignment,

01:17:15.914 --> 01:17:17.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we went down to morning worship,

01:17:17.949 --> 01:17:21.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then we had to line up,
and we were waiting to get our assignment.

01:17:21.853 --> 01:17:25.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And my stomach was churning,
and I felt really sick

01:17:25.524 --> 01:17:28.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—sick with excitement
as well as the fact that you knew

01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:30.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that whatever Brother Jaracz said,

01:17:30.762 --> 01:17:32.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the next sentence that came out of his mouth

01:17:32.998 --> 01:17:35.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would determine the rest of your life.

01:17:36.802 --> 01:17:38.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s hard to imagine

01:17:38.337 --> 01:17:40.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that 28 years have gone by

01:17:40.305 --> 01:17:41.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since our initial assignment.

01:17:41.873 --> 01:17:44.076 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But Gilead training really helped us

01:17:44.076 --> 01:17:45.677 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to understand that things

01:17:45.677 --> 01:17:46.845 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
wouldn’t always be easy.

01:17:47.379 --> 01:17:49.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that when things weren’t easy,

01:17:49.147 --> 01:17:51.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should never overreact to situations

01:17:51.450 --> 01:17:53.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but keep calm and trust in Jehovah.

01:17:53.885 --> 01:17:57.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think one of the outstanding sections
of Gilead for me

01:17:57.222 --> 01:18:01.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the section dealing with
the Gospels and Jesus Christ.

01:18:01.059 --> 01:18:03.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was always kind.

01:18:03.061 --> 01:18:07.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was always reasonable
in his dealings with people.

01:18:07.833 --> 01:18:11.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so in class, the emphasis was,
not on head knowledge,

01:18:11.903 --> 01:18:16.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but on how we can imitate Jesus Christ
in our dealings with others.

01:18:16.241 --> 01:18:18.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I remember a couple of phrases:

01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:21.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People over productivity.

01:18:21.313 --> 01:18:24.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the kind thing
is always the right thing to do.

01:18:24.916 --> 01:18:27.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These lessons are still with me
all these years later.

01:18:27.652 --> 01:18:30.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were taught how to study.

01:18:30.422 --> 01:18:34.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it helped us to study in a way

01:18:34.025 --> 01:18:38.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would build a pool
or a foundation of principles

01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:40.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that when we had a trial,

01:18:40.766 --> 01:18:44.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would have somewhere to go
and dip into that pool of principles

01:18:44.269 --> 01:18:47.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would apply to any situation
that we might face.

01:18:47.406 --> 01:18:49.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s true
that at the time you go through it,

01:18:49.941 --> 01:18:52.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re taking in all the knowledge.

01:18:52.010 --> 01:18:54.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t know when
and where you’re going to use it,

01:18:54.513 --> 01:18:56.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it teaches you the method of:

01:18:56.782 --> 01:18:59.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s store all this in the bank,
and then when I need it,

01:18:59.284 --> 01:19:01.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know where I can go and pick it from.

01:19:01.319 --> 01:19:04.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One example that comes to mind

01:19:04.089 --> 01:19:09.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a lecture we had
that highlighted Romans 15:3,

01:19:09.094 --> 01:19:13.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it talked about
how “even the Christ did not please himself.”

01:19:13.698 --> 01:19:17.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So thinking about that lecture
makes me think of a situation

01:19:17.569 --> 01:19:20.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we had been field missionaries
for a couple of years.

01:19:20.806 --> 01:19:23.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were invited
to go into the traveling work.

01:19:23.909 --> 01:19:26.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I was thinking to myself,

01:19:26.745 --> 01:19:28.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Can I really do this?’

01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:31.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then I reflected back on that lecture

01:19:31.283 --> 01:19:34.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Romans 15:3:
“The Christ [didn’t] please himself.”

01:19:34.252 --> 01:19:35.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not about me.

01:19:35.787 --> 01:19:37.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s about doing Jehovah’s will.

01:19:37.589 --> 01:19:39.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s about the people you serve.

01:19:39.124 --> 01:19:40.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reflecting on that helped me

01:19:40.425 --> 01:19:43.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see myself
in that big picture and realize,

01:19:43.261 --> 01:19:47.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘No, if Jesus could do that,
then this is what I have to do first

01:19:47.833 --> 01:19:49.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I put the brothers and sisters first.’

01:19:49.334 --> 01:19:52.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we thoroughly enjoyed being in that circuit.

01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:54.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t even know why I was so worried.

01:19:54.272 --> 01:19:56.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because at the end of three years,
we didn’t even want to leave.

01:20:00.679 --> 01:20:04.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The impact of Gilead
is not fully appreciated in the moment.

01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:06.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as the years have gone by,

01:20:06.751 --> 01:20:10.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do find myself reflecting on the lessons

01:20:10.622 --> 01:20:13.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were taught during that class.

01:20:13.291 --> 01:20:15.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I see how it’s shaped

01:20:15.627 --> 01:20:19.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the way I think and feel
all these years later.

01:20:19.164 --> 01:20:20.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I would say, yeah,

01:20:20.832 --> 01:20:25.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s had a life- or personality-changing
effect on me.

01:20:27.172 --> 01:20:30.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I think back of standing in that line,

01:20:30.008 --> 01:20:32.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, it is very vivid

01:20:32.611 --> 01:20:35.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in my memory of how I felt.

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:38.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And my stomach was definitely churning.

01:20:38.884 --> 01:20:43.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But these 28 years,
I have not regretted one single minute of it.

01:20:43.088 --> 01:20:44.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being with the brothers and sisters,

01:20:44.422 --> 01:20:48.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
serving in different forms of assignments,

01:20:48.026 --> 01:20:50.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can definitely say
without one shadow of a doubt

01:20:50.362 --> 01:20:52.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I still would not swap it for the world.

01:21:01.039 --> 01:21:03.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’ve enjoyed

01:21:03.375 --> 01:21:06.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a rich spiritual feast so far.

01:21:06.578 --> 01:21:08.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there’s more to come.

01:21:10.682 --> 01:21:13.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a blessing these graduates will be

01:21:13.285 --> 01:21:15.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the brothers and sisters
in their assignments!

01:21:16.688 --> 01:21:19.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

01:21:19.624 --> 01:21:23.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be available on jw.org later this month.

01:21:24.696 --> 01:21:28.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know you’re excited

To conclude this month’s broadcast,

01:21:31.636 --> 01:21:34.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s go to Tahiti.

01:21:35.674 --> 01:21:38.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the main island of French Polynesia,

01:21:38.877 --> 01:21:42.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a territory of about 118 inhabited islands.

01:21:42.781 --> 01:21:45.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a beautiful land marked by mountains,

01:21:45.517 --> 01:21:50.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
waterfalls, and white sand atolls.

01:21:50.188 --> 01:21:52.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The surroundings teem with life.

01:21:52.557 --> 01:21:55.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Manta rays glide through the water

01:21:55.694 --> 01:21:57.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while the land produces

01:21:57.696 --> 01:21:59.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an abundance of beautiful flower species.

01:21:59.931 --> 01:22:01.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The beauty of this island

01:22:01.933 --> 01:22:04.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is found not only in its natural scenery

01:22:04.736 --> 01:22:08.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also in the hospitable attitude
of the people.

01:22:08.707 --> 01:22:13.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters
of the Vaima Congregation make it a priority

01:22:13.612 --> 01:22:16.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to share the beauty of God’s Word.

01:22:16.615 --> 01:22:19.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their territory extends from the city center

01:22:19.517 --> 01:22:21.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the mountains and remote islands

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:24.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Apataki and Rikitea.

01:22:25.423 --> 01:22:28.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They witness to the local fishermen
at the beach

01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:31.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to the international sailors
at its large harbors,

01:22:31.663 --> 01:22:34.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their efforts have proven successful.

01:22:34.699 --> 01:22:39.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Currently, the congregation
is conducting 107 Bible studies.

01:22:40.338 --> 01:22:43.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
