Welcome to JW Broadcasting®!

00:00:05.155 --> 00:00:08.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are some highlights
from this month’s program.

00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:12.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sharon Hall couldn’t continue as a pioneer,

00:00:12.028 --> 00:00:14.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she still wanted to expend herself

00:00:14.998 --> 00:00:17.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s service.

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:20.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did she decide to do?

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what can we learn from her experience?

00:00:24.507 --> 00:00:28.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many schools promote evolution as fact.

00:00:28.344 --> 00:00:30.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that what you’re being taught?

00:00:30.714 --> 00:00:33.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll learn how you can take a stand

00:00:33.883 --> 00:00:37.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against this false idea and prove to yourself

00:00:37.387 --> 00:00:39.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God exists.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ll debut a new series

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
designed to sharpen

00:00:44.427 --> 00:00:46.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our skills in the ministry.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is JW Broadcasting for October 2021.

00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:13.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our theme for this month is

00:01:13.757 --> 00:01:18.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You Are ‘Especially Acceptable’ to Jehovah.”

00:01:18.261 --> 00:01:20.130 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We love Jehovah,

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.766 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and we want to give him our best.

00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:24.868 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But we want our sacrifices

00:01:24.868 --> 00:01:27.170 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to be acceptable to him.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we may strive to be involved
as much as possible

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:35.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all the exciting things going on
in the organization.

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:41.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But do you ever feel discouraged,
perhaps even guilty or frustrated

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:45.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding your sacrifices to Jehovah?

00:01:45.155 --> 00:01:48.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some cases, it may be
that you’re so involved

00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:51.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in so many different aspects of the work

00:01:51.995 --> 00:01:54.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that perhaps you’re not giving
adequate attention

00:01:54.564 --> 00:01:59.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to your spiritual, personal, or family needs.

00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:03.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or, on the other hand,
it may be the opposite situation.

00:02:03.506 --> 00:02:06.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may have those feelings
because you cannot do

00:02:06.743 --> 00:02:08.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as much as you’d like to

00:02:08.745 --> 00:02:11.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or as much as others are doing.

00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:15.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, you may have been
very involved in the work,

00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:20.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but unexpectedly your circumstances changed
because of your health

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or some other calamity
that came along and shut things down.

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:29.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such feelings may cause us to ask ourselves,

00:02:29.766 --> 00:02:34.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What does Jehovah really expect of us?’

00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:38.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’re going to consider
three points in our discussion.

00:02:38.107 --> 00:02:40.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first is this,

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to set the right priorities.

00:02:42.846 --> 00:02:44.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second,

00:02:44.848 --> 00:02:47.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not compare yourselves unfavorably

00:02:47.283 --> 00:02:48.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with others.

00:02:48.785 --> 00:02:50.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And third,

00:02:50.486 --> 00:02:54.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember what is important to Jehovah.

00:02:54.023 --> 00:02:55.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s start with our first point:

00:02:56.226 --> 00:02:58.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah expects us to set

00:02:58.728 --> 00:03:01.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the right priorities.

00:03:01.364 --> 00:03:03.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can we do that?

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, a scripture that’s helped me is found

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:10.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 2 Corinthians 8:12.

00:03:10.006 --> 00:03:12.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, at the time of this letter,

00:03:12.141 --> 00:03:15.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Christians in Judea
were facing many trials.

00:03:15.545 --> 00:03:19.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And these trials included
famine, persecution,

00:03:19.015 --> 00:03:21.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the plundering of their belongings.

00:03:21.718 --> 00:03:23.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They needed relief.

00:03:23.786 --> 00:03:26.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, previously, in his first letter,

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:30.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul had encouraged the Corinthians
to set aside funds

00:03:30.793 --> 00:03:33.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help the brothers in Judea.

00:03:33.196 --> 00:03:35.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shortly thereafter, when Paul wrote

00:03:35.265 --> 00:03:38.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the second inspired letter
to the Corinthians,

00:03:38.368 --> 00:03:42.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he urged them to get their gifts ready.

00:03:42.238 --> 00:03:44.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, with this context of giving,

00:03:44.674 --> 00:03:48.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sacrificing, and helping others in mind,

00:03:48.077 --> 00:03:52.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s read 2 Corinthians 8:12:

00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:56.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For if the readiness is there first,

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:58.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it is especially acceptable

00:03:58.388 --> 00:04:00.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“according to what a person has,

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:02.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not according to what a person

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:03.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does not have.”

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul here is discussing sacrifices
that are acceptable

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:13.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sacrifices
that are unacceptable to Jehovah.

00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:15.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the difference?

00:04:15.838 --> 00:04:17.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, picture it this way.

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:20.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Picture a young family in Corinth

00:04:20.443 --> 00:04:23.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a father, mother, and children.

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The father hears the letter from Paul
being read to the congregation,

00:04:28.117 --> 00:04:30.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the father is very excited.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants to help his brothers in Judea.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when the family gets home,
he discusses the matter with his wife.

00:04:38.328 --> 00:04:40.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “We have a little money

00:04:40.797 --> 00:04:44.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that we’ve set aside
to do some work on the house,

00:04:44.067 --> 00:04:48.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and we were saving
to purchase another donkey.

00:04:48.137 --> 00:04:50.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“However, I’d like to take that money

00:04:50.873 --> 00:04:54.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and contribute it
to our needy brothers in Jerusalem.”

00:04:54.877 --> 00:04:56.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think?

00:04:56.679 --> 00:05:01.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you say
that is an acceptable sacrifice?

00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:02.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:05:02.352 --> 00:05:03.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a sacrifice

00:05:03.987 --> 00:05:07.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—he and his family
are donating money to help others—

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:11.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s according to what the family has.

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:15.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That sacrifice would no doubt
be very precious to Jehovah.

00:05:15.431 --> 00:05:19.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can picture how excited
the family would be

00:05:19.002 --> 00:05:21.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to support that decision.

00:05:21.938 --> 00:05:26.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s imagine a different family
in the same congregation.

00:05:26.275 --> 00:05:30.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time, the husband comes home and says,

00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:32.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I know we do not have any extra money,

00:05:32.882 --> 00:05:35.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but I’d like to use the money
that we’ve set aside

00:05:35.918 --> 00:05:39.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to feed our family for the next two weeks

00:05:39.455 --> 00:05:42.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and donate it to the brothers
that are in need in Jerusalem.”

00:05:43.926 --> 00:05:45.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think now?

00:05:45.528 --> 00:05:50.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you say
that is an acceptable sacrifice?

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:53.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the same good motive,
the same good cause,

00:05:53.136 --> 00:05:56.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it may even be the same amount of money.

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:57.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is it acceptable?

00:05:57.874 --> 00:05:59.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:05:59.375 --> 00:06:01.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:06:01.077 --> 00:06:04.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not according to what he has.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah does not want him
to take food away from his children.

00:06:07.917 --> 00:06:12.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine him explaining
that decision to his family?

00:06:12.488 --> 00:06:16.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The father has a God-given responsibility
to feed his family.

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:21.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul says,
‘Just give according to what you have.’

00:06:22.965 --> 00:06:25.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the lesson for us?

00:06:25.201 --> 00:06:28.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can this help us to maintain balance

00:06:28.938 --> 00:06:32.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and set the right priorities?

00:06:32.008 --> 00:06:36.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, our sacrifices
are acceptable to Jehovah

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:38.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we give according to what we have.

00:06:38.948 --> 00:06:42.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But our sacrifice would be unacceptable

00:06:42.185 --> 00:06:45.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we try to give beyond what we have.

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:48.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we apply that?

00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:53.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there are certain areas
that Jehovah says are nonnegotiable.

00:06:53.596 --> 00:06:55.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are some of those areas?

00:06:56.399 --> 00:07:00.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One is our relationship with Jehovah.

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:03.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He expects us to keep
that relationship strong

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:07.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by making time for such important activities

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as lingering in prayer,
reading and meditating on God’s Word,

00:07:10.913 --> 00:07:14.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
attending and participating in our meetings,

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and having a meaningful share
in the ministry.

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:22.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what we do in the way of work
for the organization

00:07:22.625 --> 00:07:25.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must never crowd out the spiritual activities

00:07:25.995 --> 00:07:28.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that keep us close to God.

00:07:28.131 --> 00:07:32.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, that would be unacceptable
to Jehovah.

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:36.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another example
is our family responsibilities.

00:07:36.572 --> 00:07:39.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah expects us to care for our family,

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:42.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only materially and physically

00:07:42.612 --> 00:07:45.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also spiritually and emotionally.

00:07:45.515 --> 00:07:48.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we must spend time together

00:07:48.084 --> 00:07:50.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in family worship, in the field ministry,

00:07:50.486 --> 00:07:52.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in recreation.

00:07:53.756 --> 00:07:58.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means that we must not allow
our work for the organization

00:07:58.361 --> 00:08:01.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to interfere with the necessary time we need

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to care for our family.

00:08:03.833 --> 00:08:07.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That would be unacceptable to Jehovah.

00:08:08.504 --> 00:08:11.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another example is our health.

00:08:11.274 --> 00:08:14.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah expects us to serve him whole-souled.

00:08:14.443 --> 00:08:16.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That involves doing all

00:08:16.345 --> 00:08:18.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our health allows us to do.

00:08:18.881 --> 00:08:21.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we do all that we can
to maintain our health

00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:24.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by eating well, getting enough sleep,

00:08:24.987 --> 00:08:27.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and exercising regularly.

00:08:27.523 --> 00:08:32.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, again, we must not allow
our work for the organization

00:08:32.295 --> 00:08:34.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to cause us to neglect our health.

00:08:34.897 --> 00:08:39.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That would be unacceptable to Jehovah.

00:08:39.368 --> 00:08:41.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So do you see the point?

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can help us to set the right priorities?

00:08:44.874 --> 00:08:49.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, again, remember the principle
here at 2 Corinthians 8:12.

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:52.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, in effect, says:

00:08:52.114 --> 00:08:55.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Give to me according to what you have,

00:08:55.851 --> 00:08:58.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘not according to what you do not have.

00:08:58.888 --> 00:09:03.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that will be
especially acceptable to me.’

00:09:03.693 --> 00:09:07.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that even though
we have set the right priorities,

00:09:07.463 --> 00:09:10.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s still a challenge to maintain balance.

00:09:10.533 --> 00:09:13.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Balance is not something
that once you have it

00:09:13.102 --> 00:09:15.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can just lock it in.

00:09:15.104 --> 00:09:17.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, it’s like a tightrope walker

00:09:17.673 --> 00:09:21.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who must constantly recalibrate and adjust

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:23.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to maintain balance.

00:09:23.212 --> 00:09:27.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same is true
with maintaining balance in our lives.

00:09:27.617 --> 00:09:30.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know it’s a constant process for me,

00:09:30.386 --> 00:09:34.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’d guess it’s just as challenging
for you as well.

00:09:34.757 --> 00:09:37.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve had excellent articles
in our publications

00:09:37.627 --> 00:09:40.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that help with managing our time.

00:09:40.696 --> 00:09:43.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are two of them:

00:09:43.199 --> 00:09:47.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The April 2010 <i>Awake!,</i> page 7,

00:09:47.603 --> 00:09:49.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has an article entitled

00:09:49.372 --> 00:09:52.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“20 Ways to Create More Time,”

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the February 2014 <i>Awake!</i>, page 6,

00:09:57.613 --> 00:10:01.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How to Invest Your Time Wisely.”

00:10:01.651 --> 00:10:04.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may find these helpful
to do further research

00:10:04.487 --> 00:10:09.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on how to set the right priorities
and maintain balance.

00:10:10.926 --> 00:10:13.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A second point to help us maintain balance

00:10:13.729 --> 00:10:17.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is this: Do not compare yourselves

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unfavorably with others.

00:10:20.436 --> 00:10:22.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There will always be ones

00:10:22.505 --> 00:10:26.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doing more in their service
to Jehovah than we are.

00:10:26.309 --> 00:10:29.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we start comparing ourselves to them

00:10:29.512 --> 00:10:33.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or feel that they are
more acceptable to Jehovah,

00:10:33.916 --> 00:10:37.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this can cause us to lose
not just our balance

00:10:37.286 --> 00:10:39.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but our joy as well.

00:10:39.922 --> 00:10:43.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When considering this aspect
of not comparing,

00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:47.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think of the prophets
Daniel, Ezekiel, and Jeremiah.

00:10:47.697 --> 00:10:52.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you remember, these men
were contemporaries of one another,

00:10:52.168 --> 00:10:55.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but each had very different circumstances.

00:10:55.638 --> 00:11:00.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel was in the court
of the king in Babylon.

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:03.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, he had times of persecution

00:11:03.312 --> 00:11:05.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and challenges.

00:11:05.314 --> 00:11:08.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But overall, he was an official for the king.

00:11:08.417 --> 00:11:11.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He received special training
for his position.

00:11:11.721 --> 00:11:15.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he may have had it relatively easy.

00:11:16.225 --> 00:11:19.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezekiel was living among his fellow exiles

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:23.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a community “by the river Chebar.”

00:11:23.466 --> 00:11:27.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Overall, things were fairly stable there.

00:11:27.036 --> 00:11:29.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, the Jews in exile
had a measure of freedom.

00:11:29.972 --> 00:11:33.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They built houses, they had children,
they settled down,

00:11:33.209 --> 00:11:36.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they developed skills in various trades.

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:41.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it seems that perhaps they had
a relatively stable life.

00:11:42.385 --> 00:11:44.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then you have Jeremiah.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was in Jerusalem.

00:11:45.755 --> 00:11:48.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seems that somebody
was always trying to kill him.

00:11:48.491 --> 00:11:52.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Much of the time,
he was either hiding or in confinement.

00:11:53.028 --> 00:11:56.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here’s the question,
Did the differing circumstances

00:11:56.866 --> 00:11:58.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of their assignments

00:11:58.868 --> 00:12:03.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mean that Jehovah loved or favored
one more than the other?

00:12:03.406 --> 00:12:05.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not at all.

00:12:05.408 --> 00:12:07.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just an assignment.

00:12:07.843 --> 00:12:10.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wanted a prophet in Jerusalem.

00:12:10.646 --> 00:12:13.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wanted one with the exiles in Babylon,

00:12:13.516 --> 00:12:16.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he wanted another
in the court of the king.

00:12:16.652 --> 00:12:20.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just the way the assignments fell.

00:12:20.256 --> 00:12:24.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you can imagine
how counterproductive it would’ve been

00:12:24.827 --> 00:12:28.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for each of these three men
to judge his value

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:31.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
based on his assignment

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to compare himself to the other two.

00:12:34.103 --> 00:12:35.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could happen.

00:12:35.471 --> 00:12:36.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it.

00:12:36.439 --> 00:12:39.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezekiel and Jeremiah

00:12:39.642 --> 00:12:42.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could have looked at Daniel and thought:

00:12:42.244 --> 00:12:45.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Ah, he has direct access to the king.

00:12:45.648 --> 00:12:48.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He’s living where all the big decisions
are being made.

00:12:48.517 --> 00:12:50.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He’s right in the center of it all.

00:12:50.619 --> 00:12:54.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He can use his influence
to help Jehovah’s people.

00:12:54.256 --> 00:12:56.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What a privilege that would be!

00:12:56.325 --> 00:12:58.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wish I was there!’

00:12:58.694 --> 00:13:02.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or Daniel and Jeremiah

00:13:02.097 --> 00:13:04.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could’ve looked at Ezekiel

00:13:04.366 --> 00:13:07.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and felt that’s where they wished they were:

00:13:07.603 --> 00:13:11.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘We would have at least relative freedom
with the exiles.

00:13:11.841 --> 00:13:15.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘We’d be able to encourage
our fellow worshippers of Jehovah.

00:13:15.678 --> 00:13:18.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could help others learn about Jehovah.’

00:13:19.548 --> 00:13:22.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or, believe it or not, Daniel and Ezekiel

00:13:22.751 --> 00:13:25.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could’ve looked at Jeremiah and thought:

00:13:25.855 --> 00:13:29.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘We know things are tough,
but that’s where we want to be.

00:13:29.792 --> 00:13:34.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He’s on the front lines, risking his life
for Jehovah and the nation.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s where the action is.’

00:13:37.766 --> 00:13:41.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Different assignments,
different circumstances,

00:13:41.504 --> 00:13:43.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
different locations

00:13:43.606 --> 00:13:47.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—but they were all special to Jehovah.

00:13:47.376 --> 00:13:49.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the lesson?

00:13:49.378 --> 00:13:51.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The lesson is

00:13:51.113 --> 00:13:53.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we must be careful

00:13:53.415 --> 00:13:57.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we do not compare ourselves
unfavorably with others.

00:13:57.486 --> 00:14:01.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is good to see
if we can imitate and benefit

00:14:01.023 --> 00:14:03.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the example of others,

00:14:03.158 --> 00:14:05.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we need to be careful

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we do not begin determining the value

00:14:08.163 --> 00:14:10.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what we’re doing for Jehovah

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
based on what others are doing.

00:14:12.735 --> 00:14:15.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That could cause us to lose our joy,

00:14:15.638 --> 00:14:17.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lose our balance,

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:22.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fall into the trap
of doing things for the wrong reasons.

00:14:22.478 --> 00:14:24.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That brings us to our last point:

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:28.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember what is important to Jehovah.

00:14:28.984 --> 00:14:32.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Circumstances change in life.

00:14:32.321 --> 00:14:35.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As mentioned, in the past we may have been

00:14:35.224 --> 00:14:37.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
extremely busy in Jehovah’s service.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:42.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But because of the world’s situation,
that may have changed.

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:46.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or other circumstances in our life
may have changed.

00:14:46.468 --> 00:14:50.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does that somehow change
how Jehovah feels about us?

00:14:50.773 --> 00:14:51.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:14:51.874 --> 00:14:53.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we know?

00:14:53.208 --> 00:14:55.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is important to Jehovah?

00:14:55.945 --> 00:15:00.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What makes you
“especially acceptable” to Jehovah?

00:15:00.282 --> 00:15:02.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s read together

00:15:02.284 --> 00:15:06.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acts 10:34, 35:

00:15:06.722 --> 00:15:11.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At this Peter began to speak, and he said:

00:15:11.293 --> 00:15:13.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Now I truly understand

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:15.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘that God is not partial,

00:15:15.097 --> 00:15:18.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘but in every nation the man who fears him

00:15:18.367 --> 00:15:20.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and does what is right

00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:22.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is acceptable to him.’”

00:15:22.204 --> 00:15:24.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fear Jehovah.

00:15:24.106 --> 00:15:25.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do what is right.

00:15:25.608 --> 00:15:27.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obey his commandments.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:29.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s it.

00:15:29.345 --> 00:15:33.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what makes us acceptable to Jehovah.

00:15:33.415 --> 00:15:38.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We complicate things at times
and equate our responsibilities

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:41.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how we’re used,
where we’re asked to serve—

00:15:41.957 --> 00:15:44.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as things that define our value.

00:15:44.827 --> 00:15:48.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not how Jehovah sees things.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:50.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A scripture that has helped me

00:15:50.299 --> 00:15:54.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is found at Ecclesiastes 3:10:

00:15:55.537 --> 00:15:59.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have seen the occupation

00:15:59.274 --> 00:16:02.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that God has given to the sons of men

00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:05.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep them occupied.”

00:16:05.648 --> 00:16:10.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The occupation” refers
to our activities, the things we do.

00:16:10.085 --> 00:16:14.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah has given us work
to keep us occupied.

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:17.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whenever I read that,
I think of parents with their children.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:22.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps they take them to the beach
for the afternoon, and what do they do?

00:16:22.031 --> 00:16:24.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They give them some toys,
and they let them play.

00:16:24.767 --> 00:16:26.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:16:26.301 --> 00:16:29.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To keep them occupied.

00:16:29.672 --> 00:16:32.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that, in a way,
is what Jehovah does with us.

00:16:32.908 --> 00:16:37.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you think about it,
Jehovah does not need us to do the work.

00:16:37.212 --> 00:16:40.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can accomplish his work without us,

00:16:40.349 --> 00:16:44.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he dignifies us and allows us
to have a share.

00:16:44.319 --> 00:16:47.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He provides us with meaningful work.

00:16:47.956 --> 00:16:50.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Note what it goes on to say in verse 13

00:16:50.325 --> 00:16:53.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Ecclesiastes chapter 3:

00:16:53.095 --> 00:16:56.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Also that everyone should eat and drink

00:16:56.432 --> 00:17:00.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and find enjoyment for all his hard work.

00:17:00.235 --> 00:17:02.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is the gift of God.”

00:17:03.238 --> 00:17:06.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Work is a gift from Jehovah.

00:17:06.508 --> 00:17:10.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it reasonable to think
that Jehovah would give a gift

00:17:10.412 --> 00:17:14.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that stresses us out
or creates hardship for us?

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:15.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:17:15.617 --> 00:17:18.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants us to find enjoyment in our work.

00:17:18.921 --> 00:17:23.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are the ones that may get too concerned
with assigning rank and priority

00:17:23.826 --> 00:17:27.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to various privileges
and locations of service

00:17:27.096 --> 00:17:31.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—where we are in the sand
and what toys we have to play with.

00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:36.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is important to Jehovah?

00:17:36.105 --> 00:17:38.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice our final scripture

00:17:38.107 --> 00:17:42.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Ecclesiastes 12:13:

00:17:42.578 --> 00:17:45.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The conclusion of the matter,

00:17:45.981 --> 00:17:48.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“everything having been heard, is:

00:17:48.517 --> 00:17:50.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Fear the true God

00:17:50.519 --> 00:17:52.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and keep his commandments,

00:17:52.521 --> 00:17:56.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for this is the whole obligation of man.”

00:17:56.658 --> 00:17:58.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fear Jehovah.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep his commandments.

00:18:00.662 --> 00:18:03.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just serve Jehovah.

00:18:03.031 --> 00:18:05.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do the best that you can.

00:18:05.033 --> 00:18:07.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay balanced.

00:18:07.035 --> 00:18:10.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Give according to what you have.

00:18:10.405 --> 00:18:12.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those are the important things.

00:18:12.641 --> 00:18:17.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you do them, no matter what
your personal circumstances,

00:18:17.012 --> 00:18:22.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will remain
“especially acceptable” to Jehovah.

00:18:22.918 --> 00:18:25.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s look at some situations

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could challenge us to maintain balance.

00:18:28.557 --> 00:18:31.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:18:31.059 --> 00:18:35.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how the two characters
maintain balance.

00:18:39.434 --> 00:18:41.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ms. Kwon?

00:18:42.471 --> 00:18:43.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ms. Kwon?

00:18:43.772 --> 00:18:44.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh!

00:18:47.342 --> 00:18:48.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sorry.

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:49.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ms. Kwon?

00:18:52.014 --> 00:18:54.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m so slow today.

00:18:54.016 --> 00:18:55.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s OK.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:56.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take your time.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So can you pioneer next month?

00:19:00.455 --> 00:19:02.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt you will experience
greater joy . . .

00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:06.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Joo?

00:19:06.628 --> 00:19:07.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Joo? Over here.

00:19:07.696 --> 00:19:08.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Sister Kwon.

00:19:08.564 --> 00:19:09.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can I have one too?

00:19:09.798 --> 00:19:12.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, of course.

00:19:12.067 --> 00:19:14.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just a moment, please.

00:19:15.337 --> 00:19:19.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Joo, I have
many doctors’ appointments next month,

00:19:19.408 --> 00:19:20.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but maybe—

00:19:20.976 --> 00:19:21.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, OK.

00:19:21.677 --> 00:19:22.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:19:23.145 --> 00:19:25.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wrote a little something
that might help you when you fill it out.

00:19:25.848 --> 00:19:27.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, I see.

00:19:28.183 --> 00:19:29.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you go.

00:19:29.585 --> 00:19:30.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:19:30.752 --> 00:19:33.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And remember, our circuit overseer’s visit
is in two months.

00:19:33.589 --> 00:19:34.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mm-hm.

00:19:34.389 --> 00:19:36.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And only 30 hours are required that month.

00:19:36.058 --> 00:19:36.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I see.

00:19:36.892 --> 00:19:37.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Joo?

00:19:37.826 --> 00:19:38.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes. Hello, Brother Lee.

00:19:38.594 --> 00:19:39.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:19:39.194 --> 00:19:40.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello, Sister Kwon.

00:19:40.229 --> 00:19:41.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello, Brother Lee.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nice job covering those parts
at the last minute.

00:19:44.867 --> 00:19:48.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anyway, it seems like everyone is away.

00:19:49.171 --> 00:19:50.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello, Sister Kwon.

00:19:50.239 --> 00:19:52.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can I ask you to do something?

00:19:52.674 --> 00:19:54.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s what I need.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:56.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello, Sister Joo.

00:19:57.045 --> 00:20:00.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you want to get something done,
give it to a busy man.

00:20:01.016 --> 00:20:02.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can always count on you.

00:20:02.751 --> 00:20:05.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hannah and I
were beginning to feel overwhelmed.

00:20:05.554 --> 00:20:07.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . in Jesus’ name we pray. Amen.

00:20:09.791 --> 00:20:11.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Joo, 

00:20:11.193 --> 00:20:13.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may I have a moment?

00:20:13.428 --> 00:20:14.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need your help with something.

00:20:14.563 --> 00:20:16.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then Brother Kim needed help

00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:18.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the territories.

00:20:19.902 --> 00:20:23.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we loved being busy
with theocratic work.

00:20:32.814 --> 00:20:34.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Brother Kim?

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:36.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just a second.

00:20:36.919 --> 00:20:39.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Brother Kim
calling about the territories.

00:20:39.154 --> 00:20:40.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll only take a minute.

00:20:40.622 --> 00:20:42.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, uh-huh.

00:20:43.992 --> 00:20:45.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I see.

00:20:45.928 --> 00:20:47.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, I understand.

00:20:48.397 --> 00:20:52.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, sounds good.

00:20:52.768 --> 00:20:55.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Other more important things
were beginning to suffer.

00:21:00.943 --> 00:21:02.778 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s like doctors’ appointments

00:21:02.778 --> 00:21:05.280 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
are my whole life now.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have so many next month,

00:21:07.683 --> 00:21:10.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they take forever to reschedule.

00:21:10.852 --> 00:21:13.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could I possibly make my time?

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:17.592 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
There’s something written here.

00:21:17.592 --> 00:21:22.297 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Prayerfully consider 2 Corinthians 8:12.”

00:21:23.699 --> 00:21:26.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If the readiness is there . . .

00:21:26.668 --> 00:21:28.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[oh, I am ready],

00:21:29.972 --> 00:21:32.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . according to what a person has,

00:21:32.341 --> 00:21:35.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not according to what a person
does not have.”

00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:36.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm.

00:21:39.181 --> 00:21:43.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wanted the Israelites
to sacrifice their best,

00:21:43.118 --> 00:21:45.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but just imagine what would happen

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they tried to do more than they could.

00:21:48.223 --> 00:21:50.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can almost hear the reaction.

00:21:52.294 --> 00:21:53.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dad!

00:21:53.061 --> 00:21:54.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where did all the sheep go?

00:21:54.529 --> 00:21:55.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of them?

00:21:55.831 --> 00:21:58.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are we supposed to live on?

00:21:59.634 --> 00:22:00.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:22:00.502 --> 00:22:02.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t want them to sacrifice so much

00:22:02.804 --> 00:22:05.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they couldn’t support their families.

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need those appointments.

00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:12.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But maybe in two months
when I don’t have so many appointments

00:22:12.147 --> 00:22:15.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s the circuit overseer’s visit,
I could set a goal.

00:22:16.651 --> 00:22:18.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We knew we were taking on too much work.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But could we say no?

00:22:20.255 --> 00:22:22.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We wanted Jehovah’s view.

00:22:24.693 --> 00:22:26.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s so funny?

00:22:26.561 --> 00:22:27.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um.

00:22:27.996 --> 00:22:32.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s something I just shared
with Sister Kwon

00:22:32.034 --> 00:22:34.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is perfect for us too

00:22:34.736 --> 00:22:37.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—2 Corinthians 8:12.

00:22:37.172 --> 00:22:39.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“According to what a person has”

00:22:39.941 --> 00:22:42.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it’s just like our financial contributions.

00:22:42.377 --> 00:22:43.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exactly.

00:22:44.079 --> 00:22:46.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Honey, would Jehovah
want us to get into debt

00:22:46.715 --> 00:22:49.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make a huge contribution
we couldn’t afford?

00:22:50.052 --> 00:22:51.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amen.

00:22:52.454 --> 00:22:55.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, that scripture that we just read—

00:22:57.392 --> 00:22:58.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Kim Si-Young.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Territories again?

00:23:00.395 --> 00:23:01.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:04.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I’ll tell him that I’ll call him
after family worship.

00:23:06.535 --> 00:23:08.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can’t give what’s not ours.

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:12.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can’t let
our spiritual routine suffer,

00:23:12.707 --> 00:23:14.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even for theocratic privileges.

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:17.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Note this promise in the Bible.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:19.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at this flower.

00:23:19.614 --> 00:23:21.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t it beautiful?

00:23:21.483 --> 00:23:24.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love this time of year.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you both so much

00:23:27.656 --> 00:23:29.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your help this month.

00:23:29.558 --> 00:23:31.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It felt good to find the right balance

00:23:31.827 --> 00:23:34.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to know we’re giving Jehovah all we can.

00:23:38.633 --> 00:23:41.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did our brother and sister feel

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:45.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they set priorities
that were right for them?

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:49.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were not downhearted
that they couldn’t do more.

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:52.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, they felt good
knowing they were giving Jehovah

00:23:52.914 --> 00:23:55.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all they can give.

00:23:55.517 --> 00:23:58.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s consider a different situation.

00:23:58.753 --> 00:24:03.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After serving as a regular pioneer
for many years,

00:24:03.358 --> 00:24:07.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sharon Hall couldn’t continue
in full-time service.

00:24:07.195 --> 00:24:11.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But she still wanted to give
Jehovah something special.

00:24:13.768 --> 00:24:18.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started pioneering in 1978,
straight out of school.

00:24:18.473 --> 00:24:20.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then after 17 years,

00:24:20.842 --> 00:24:24.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to stop because I could no longer meet
the hour requirement.

00:24:24.546 --> 00:24:27.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At one of the conventions, I saw

00:24:27.215 --> 00:24:31.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some sisters interpreting the program
into sign language.

00:24:31.386 --> 00:24:35.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I thought
that even if I couldn’t continue pioneering,

00:24:35.457 --> 00:24:38.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could do something more
in Jehovah’s service

00:24:38.693 --> 00:24:42.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by learning sign language,
and so I started to do that.

00:24:42.063 --> 00:24:44.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because I was deeply grateful to Jehovah

00:24:44.166 --> 00:24:46.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all he had done for me,

00:24:46.701 --> 00:24:49.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I resumed pioneering again

00:24:49.171 --> 00:24:51.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in September 2009.

00:24:51.673 --> 00:24:54.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then I had the added blessing

00:24:54.176 --> 00:24:57.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of now pioneering in the sign-language field.

00:24:57.646 --> 00:24:59.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day I met Cecilia.

00:24:59.981 --> 00:25:04.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She suffers from a genetic syndrome called

00:25:04.819 --> 00:25:07.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Usher Syndrome, which causes deafness

00:25:07.556 --> 00:25:10.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
coupled with tunnel vision

00:25:10.392 --> 00:25:14.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can, over time, lead to blindness.

00:25:14.229 --> 00:25:16.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of that disability,

00:25:16.431 --> 00:25:19.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it made her extremely shy.

00:25:19.367 --> 00:25:22.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it was very difficult
to communicate with her.

00:25:22.537 --> 00:25:24.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started studying with her

00:25:24.706 --> 00:25:27.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in October 2009,

00:25:27.042 --> 00:25:31.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and very quickly
she started attending meetings.

00:25:31.012 --> 00:25:35.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would fetch her for the meetings
and then drop her off at home afterward.

00:25:35.684 --> 00:25:38.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lived about five minutes
from the Kingdom Hall,

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she was thirty minutes away.

00:25:41.423 --> 00:25:43.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I quickly realized

00:25:43.425 --> 00:25:47.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she would also need to put in effort

00:25:47.229 --> 00:25:50.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get to the meetings
in order to make progress.

00:25:50.532 --> 00:25:52.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cecilia lived close

00:25:52.367 --> 00:25:55.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to where she could catch a taxi

00:25:55.103 --> 00:25:57.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
up to the train line,

00:25:57.205 --> 00:25:59.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then it would be two train journeys

00:25:59.274 --> 00:26:01.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get to the Kingdom Hall.

00:26:01.309 --> 00:26:03.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it would take her, each way,

00:26:03.411 --> 00:26:05.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an hour and a half to two hours.

00:26:05.981 --> 00:26:10.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She also lived in a notoriously unsafe area

00:26:10.986 --> 00:26:13.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of gang violence.

00:26:13.455 --> 00:26:16.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I knew that Cecilia was

00:26:16.658 --> 00:26:19.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
strong-willed enough and independent enough,

00:26:19.761 --> 00:26:24.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in spite of her timidity and reticence,

00:26:24.266 --> 00:26:27.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to get herself to the meetings.

00:26:27.102 --> 00:26:30.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cecilia was attending meetings regularly.

00:26:30.071 --> 00:26:32.107 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But instead of a skirt,

00:26:32.107 --> 00:26:35.076 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
she wore pants to the meetings.

00:26:35.076 --> 00:26:37.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I chatted to Nancy,

00:26:37.312 --> 00:26:40.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a sister who at the time was accompanying me

00:26:40.282 --> 00:26:42.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to her study most weeks,

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:45.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we could try
and figure out a way of helping her

00:26:45.487 --> 00:26:47.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make the change she needed to make.

00:26:47.589 --> 00:26:49.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It took about a year

00:26:49.591 --> 00:26:53.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of gently showing pictures

00:26:53.328 --> 00:26:55.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reviewing the Bible principles,

00:26:55.363 --> 00:26:57.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but eventually she did get the point.

00:26:57.699 --> 00:27:00.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the weekends
that she was staying over,

00:27:00.135 --> 00:27:02.203 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I went into her room,

00:27:02.203 --> 00:27:04.673 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and on her bed, neatly laid out,

00:27:04.673 --> 00:27:06.675 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was a skirt and top

00:27:06.675 --> 00:27:08.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ready for the meeting.

00:27:08.877 --> 00:27:11.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thanked Jehovah at that point

00:27:11.279 --> 00:27:15.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because, finally,
our patience had been rewarded.

00:27:15.817 --> 00:27:18.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had all of our meetings on a Saturday

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:22.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a lunch break in between
when we would associate,

00:27:22.857 --> 00:27:26.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we noticed that Cecilia
was isolating herself.

00:27:26.728 --> 00:27:29.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To reinforce for Cecilia

00:27:29.164 --> 00:27:32.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the principle at Acts 20:35,

00:27:32.334 --> 00:27:36.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a friend came up with the good idea
of helping her

00:27:36.204 --> 00:27:39.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to bake cookies the day before the meeting.

00:27:39.074 --> 00:27:43.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cecilia shyly offered the cookies
to each person there

00:27:43.211 --> 00:27:45.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the lunch break,

00:27:45.246 --> 00:27:47.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it elicited such a warm response

00:27:47.315 --> 00:27:50.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the brothers and sisters
and friends there.

00:27:50.385 --> 00:27:53.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really drove home the point for Cecilia,

00:27:53.855 --> 00:27:57.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was beautiful to see her, after that,
come out of her shell.

00:27:57.992 --> 00:28:00.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In July 2014,

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:05.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cecilia gave her first student talk,

00:28:05.266 --> 00:28:08.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in that month
she also started publishing.

00:28:08.937 --> 00:28:12.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There have been challenges, particularly

00:28:12.173 --> 00:28:15.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with learning sign language
but even more so

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:19.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in getting to understand the deaf culture

00:28:19.948 --> 00:28:23.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the way that they think—
and also financial hardships.

00:28:23.518 --> 00:28:28.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the challenges and the sacrifices

00:28:28.056 --> 00:28:32.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were far outweighed by the blessings.

00:28:32.093 --> 00:28:35.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A day that’s etched in my memory

00:28:35.363 --> 00:28:39.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the day that she told me
she wanted to get baptized.

00:28:39.067 --> 00:28:43.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cecilia has really become
like a daughter to me,

00:28:43.104 --> 00:28:47.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m so proud of the enormous strides
that she made in the truth.

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:52.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In October 2015, she was baptized,

00:28:52.914 --> 00:28:55.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I cried with joy that day.

00:28:55.417 --> 00:28:58.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve been pioneering now for 28 years.

00:28:58.653 --> 00:29:02.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And over that time,
particularly since I started again

00:29:02.557 --> 00:29:04.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and with Cecilia),

00:29:04.559 --> 00:29:09.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many, many, many brothers and sisters
in the congregation helped me.

00:29:09.097 --> 00:29:12.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They accompanied me to her study;

00:29:12.066 --> 00:29:14.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they became friends with her;

00:29:14.102 --> 00:29:16.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they took over when I went away.

00:29:16.905 --> 00:29:19.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could never have done it on my own.

00:29:19.274 --> 00:29:21.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Above all,

00:29:21.276 --> 00:29:24.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has helped me to cultivate qualities

00:29:24.612 --> 00:29:27.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like patience, self-control,

00:29:27.982 --> 00:29:30.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
humility, compassion.

00:29:30.118 --> 00:29:33.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was really wonderful to play a small part

00:29:33.955 --> 00:29:37.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—such a privilege—
to help Cecilia

00:29:37.592 --> 00:29:40.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to become part of Jehovah’s family.

00:29:45.266 --> 00:29:49.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sharon’s decision required sacrifice,

00:29:49.137 --> 00:29:52.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it led to wonderful blessings for her

00:29:52.774 --> 00:29:55.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for Cecilia.

00:29:55.376 --> 00:29:57.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hope that young Witnesses

00:29:57.879 --> 00:30:01.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been enjoying our series <i>My Teen Life.</i>

00:30:01.216 --> 00:30:05.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It features real issues that you face today.

00:30:05.687 --> 00:30:07.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our next episode

00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:11.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
deals with one
of life’s most important questions:

00:30:11.926 --> 00:30:15.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why believe in God?

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:17.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever asked yourself that,

00:30:17.966 --> 00:30:22.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though you’ve been reading the Bible
and attending meetings for years?

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:25.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen to your peers explain

00:30:25.106 --> 00:30:29.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how they convinced themselves
that God does exist.

00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:39.454 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So I’m sitting in physics class,

00:30:39.454 --> 00:30:41.456 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and all of a sudden,

00:30:41.456 --> 00:30:43.758 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the subject of evolution comes up.

00:30:43.758 --> 00:30:45.627 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When my teacher asked me, “Why?”

00:30:45.627 --> 00:30:47.095 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—to give the reason why I don’t believe

00:30:47.095 --> 00:30:48.263 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in evolution—

00:30:48.263 --> 00:30:51.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember all I could say was: “It’s just
because I’m one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:30:51.866 --> 00:30:53.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s my belief.”

00:30:53.001 --> 00:30:55.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many students actually believe

00:30:55.470 --> 00:31:00.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—like, they seem so sure—
that evolution is a fact.

00:31:00.174 --> 00:31:04.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could feel my hands, like my palms,
getting sweaty

00:31:04.112 --> 00:31:06.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was just nervous.

00:31:06.481 --> 00:31:08.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt intimidated.

00:31:08.316 --> 00:31:09.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just sat there.

00:31:09.951 --> 00:31:13.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt paralyzed,
and I couldn’t defend the truth.

00:31:13.221 --> 00:31:14.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can’t I explain this?

00:31:14.722 --> 00:31:17.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could explain so easily
why I don’t salute the flag

00:31:17.492 --> 00:31:19.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and why I don’t celebrate birthdays.

00:31:19.661 --> 00:31:23.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t understand
why I couldn’t explain this specific topic.

00:31:24.732 --> 00:31:25.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had doubts.

00:31:25.833 --> 00:31:29.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I was asking myself questions like:

00:31:30.471 --> 00:31:32.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Does God really exist?

00:31:32.507 --> 00:31:34.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is the Bible accurate?’

00:31:34.509 --> 00:31:36.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that day, after I came home from school,

00:31:36.744 --> 00:31:39.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went to my mom and I told her,

00:31:39.681 --> 00:31:44.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is what happened at school, and I need—
I need answers.”

00:31:44.385 --> 00:31:47.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like I didn’t know what to do,

00:31:47.355 --> 00:31:51.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially since my parents
were not serving Jehovah.

00:31:51.559 --> 00:31:55.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I had to pray to Jehovah to help me.

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:57.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So she sat me down at the computer.

00:31:57.999 --> 00:32:00.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We went to jw.org,

00:32:00.335 --> 00:32:03.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then in the search box,
my mom told me to type in anything

00:32:03.571 --> 00:32:06.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was the problem
—what I had questions on.

00:32:06.374 --> 00:32:08.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we typed in “evolution.”

00:32:08.409 --> 00:32:11.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s when I clicked
on <i>The Origin of Life </i> brochure.

00:32:11.245 --> 00:32:14.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just started, like, coming in.

00:32:14.382 --> 00:32:17.185 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Everything started clicking as if, like,

00:32:17.185 --> 00:32:19.520 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
you know, there’s a light bulb that went off.

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:24.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in one of the videos in the “Viewpoints
on the Origin of Life” section,

00:32:24.525 --> 00:32:26.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it talked about the brain

00:32:26.928 --> 00:32:29.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how the brain is so complex

00:32:29.397 --> 00:32:31.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that billions and billions

00:32:31.699 --> 00:32:34.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of neurons are connected to one another.

00:32:34.602 --> 00:32:38.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It amazed me so much
that because of the brain,

00:32:38.973 --> 00:32:41.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can move our hands,
we can move our feet,

00:32:41.609 --> 00:32:43.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can do facial expressions.

00:32:43.711 --> 00:32:45.480 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We can do so many things

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:47.382 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because of this great part of the body

00:32:47.382 --> 00:32:48.549 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—the brain.

00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:50.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It had, you know, the exact questions

00:32:50.752 --> 00:32:54.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I was having trouble understanding.

00:32:54.756 --> 00:32:56.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for each question, I was like,

00:32:56.791 --> 00:33:00.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Oh, I remember reading this
in one of the <i>Watchtowers</i>

00:33:00.395 --> 00:33:02.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or one of the books I was studying.’

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:04.298 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But it broke it down into ways

00:33:04.298 --> 00:33:06.901 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and into words that were simple for me

00:33:06.901 --> 00:33:08.102 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to understand at that point.

00:33:08.102 --> 00:33:10.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it was almost—
It felt like

00:33:10.471 --> 00:33:12.473 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was talking to me

00:33:12.473 --> 00:33:14.008 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
through this brochure.

00:33:14.008 --> 00:33:15.143 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And it just felt—

00:33:15.143 --> 00:33:16.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was like, ‘This is what I need to read.’

00:33:16.978 --> 00:33:20.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what helped me get through it.

00:33:20.615 --> 00:33:23.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I thought to myself:
‘This couldn’t have been

00:33:23.317 --> 00:33:25.753 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‘made just by chance.

00:33:25.753 --> 00:33:28.322 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‘It couldn’t just exist by an accident.

00:33:28.322 --> 00:33:30.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘It had to be created.

00:33:30.324 --> 00:33:32.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It had to be designed.’

00:33:33.127 --> 00:33:34.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I was able to go back.

00:33:34.996 --> 00:33:38.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went to my science class,
and I told my teacher,

00:33:38.266 --> 00:33:40.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’m ready to explain why.”

00:33:40.134 --> 00:33:41.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here we go again.

00:33:41.669 --> 00:33:43.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s physics class.

00:33:43.371 --> 00:33:46.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the same topic all over again.

00:33:46.307 --> 00:33:48.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this time it was different.

00:33:48.342 --> 00:33:51.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to defend my faith in Jehovah.

00:33:51.946 --> 00:33:55.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that, you know,
Jehovah always provides the answers

00:33:55.116 --> 00:33:57.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to any topic—anything.

00:33:57.285 --> 00:34:00.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just have to be willing to go and find it.

00:34:00.054 --> 00:34:03.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whenever I have questions about anything,
I look for the answers.

00:34:03.691 --> 00:34:05.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But first, I pray to Jehovah.

00:34:05.993 --> 00:34:10.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah has made it so easy for us
to find the truth.

00:34:10.131 --> 00:34:13.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m totally convinced
that whatever he says in the Bible,

00:34:13.968 --> 00:34:16.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can completely trust in it.

00:34:34.522 --> 00:34:37.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we saw, it’s important

00:34:37.091 --> 00:34:41.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you teens
do more than disprove evolution.

00:34:41.863 --> 00:34:44.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The underlying issue

00:34:44.198 --> 00:34:47.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is whether you personally believe in God.

00:34:47.802 --> 00:34:49.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Use your “power of reason”

00:34:49.904 --> 00:34:54.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prove to yourself that he does exist.

00:34:54.509 --> 00:34:59.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re very excited
to share with you a new series.

00:34:59.013 --> 00:35:02.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of us enjoy
the visit of our circuit overseer,

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:06.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially the way
he takes the lead in the ministry.

00:35:06.654 --> 00:35:09.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Often, the circuit overseer helps us

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:13.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to apply suggestions from the faithful slave

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:16.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on how to better carry out our ministry.

00:35:16.531 --> 00:35:19.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This new series features

00:35:19.033 --> 00:35:22.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
experienced circuit overseers
doing just that,

00:35:22.937 --> 00:35:27.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helping us sharpen our skills
in the disciple-making work.

00:35:27.942 --> 00:35:31.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The series is called <i>Iron Sharpens Iron.</i>

00:35:31.913 --> 00:35:35.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our first episode, Taylor Bornschein

00:35:35.716 --> 00:35:40.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shares suggestions
on how to effectively start conversations.

00:35:42.657 --> 00:35:46.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi, I’m Taylor,
and this is “Iron Sharpens Iron.”

00:35:55.069 --> 00:35:56.204 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Today, we’re going to practice

00:35:56.204 --> 00:35:58.239 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
how to start a conversation

00:35:58.239 --> 00:36:00.274 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that could lead to a witness.

00:36:00.942 --> 00:36:03.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, for many, this can be terrifying.

00:36:03.911 --> 00:36:05.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:36:05.746 --> 00:36:08.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as soon as we see someone
that we’d like to talk to,

00:36:08.416 --> 00:36:11.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can start to think to ourselves:
‘What am I going to say?

00:36:11.919 --> 00:36:13.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How am I going to give a witness?’

00:36:13.554 --> 00:36:15.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or, ‘How are they going to react?’

00:36:15.723 --> 00:36:20.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can become
so overwhelmed with anxiety or nerves,

00:36:20.027 --> 00:36:24.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thinking about how the conversation will end,
that we never even start.

00:36:24.599 --> 00:36:27.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here’s something
that we must keep in mind.

00:36:27.735 --> 00:36:30.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our goal is simply

00:36:30.371 --> 00:36:33.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to <i>start </i> a conversation.

00:36:33.741 --> 00:36:36.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if we’ve started a conversation,

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:38.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve succeeded—we’ve reached our goal!

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:43.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we can just relax
and see if it leads to a witness.

00:36:43.885 --> 00:36:47.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The September 2018

00:36:47.221 --> 00:36:49.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Life and Ministry Meeting Workbook</i>

00:36:49.824 --> 00:36:53.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shows us how we can start a conversation

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:58.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Jesus did with the Samaritan woman
in John chapter 4.

00:36:58.065 --> 00:37:01.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we see someone
that we would like to talk to,

00:37:01.435 --> 00:37:04.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to keep these three steps in mind:

00:37:04.338 --> 00:37:08.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Step 1: Be friendly.

00:37:08.476 --> 00:37:11.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s it.
Just be friendly.

00:37:11.679 --> 00:37:13.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we could be nervous.

00:37:13.814 --> 00:37:16.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we can say a quick prayer
to Jehovah to give us courage,

00:37:16.517 --> 00:37:19.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then we can give a friendly greeting.

00:37:19.587 --> 00:37:22.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we can mention something
that’s happening right then and there:

00:37:22.957 --> 00:37:26.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe the weather,
a long line at the grocery store,

00:37:26.661 --> 00:37:30.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their nice car,
or another genuine compliment.

00:37:30.631 --> 00:37:34.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jesus started his conversation,
in verse 7,

00:37:34.268 --> 00:37:36.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Samaritan woman, he simply said

00:37:36.871 --> 00:37:40.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and no doubt in a friendly way):
“Give me a drink.”

00:37:41.008 --> 00:37:43.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Step 2:

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:46.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let the conversation progress naturally.

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t rush it.

00:37:48.482 --> 00:37:53.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the conversation ends before we are able
to give a witness, it’s OK.

00:37:53.187 --> 00:37:56.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We accomplished our goal.
We started a conversation.

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:58.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we’re ready to try again.

00:37:58.793 --> 00:38:01.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if the conversation continues on,

00:38:01.662 --> 00:38:05.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we can look for an opportunity
to take step 3:

00:38:05.132 --> 00:38:09.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make a simple expression of our faith.

00:38:09.003 --> 00:38:13.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seven verses after Jesus
started the conversation

00:38:13.975 --> 00:38:17.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Samaritan woman,
he then witnessed to her.

00:38:17.411 --> 00:38:20.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said he had water
that imparts everlasting life.

00:38:20.715 --> 00:38:24.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But between those two points,
he didn’t lecture her.

00:38:24.652 --> 00:38:27.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He let her talk and express herself,

00:38:27.388 --> 00:38:30.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he listened to what she had to say.

00:38:30.224 --> 00:38:34.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So with those three steps in mind,
now it’s our turn.

00:38:34.261 --> 00:38:36.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s our turn to practice

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:40.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
starting a conversation
that could lead to a witness.

00:38:40.334 --> 00:38:42.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, tied in with us, we have

00:38:42.436 --> 00:38:46.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Taís and Carolina
who have joined us for a demonstration.

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:50.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So where are you going to try
to start your conversation today?

00:38:50.678 --> 00:38:52.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are in a department store.

00:38:52.179 --> 00:38:54.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we are in a Portuguese congregation,

00:38:54.281 --> 00:38:57.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s common to hear people speak
Portuguese when we are out shopping.

00:38:57.551 --> 00:38:59.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Excellent.

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:01.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you’ve heard the three steps
that we want to try.

00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:05.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But first, let’s see what could happen
if we rush the conversation.

00:39:05.459 --> 00:39:06.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:39:06.727 --> 00:39:08.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Oi, tudo bem?</i>

00:39:08.262 --> 00:39:10.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I heard you speaking Portuguese.

00:39:10.064 --> 00:39:11.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where are you from?

00:39:11.098 --> 00:39:13.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Oi, </i>I’m from Rio de Janeiro.

00:39:13.367 --> 00:39:14.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m from São Paulo.

00:39:14.769 --> 00:39:16.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How long have you been here?

00:39:16.203 --> 00:39:17.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just three months.

00:39:17.638 --> 00:39:19.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s so hard to adjust, isn’t it?

00:39:19.774 --> 00:39:23.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, the Bible helped me so much
when I moved here.

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:25.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t want to keep you from your shopping,
but you can read

00:39:25.646 --> 00:39:27.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible in Portuguese on our website,

00:39:27.882 --> 00:39:30.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it has articles
that I know you will find comforting.

00:39:30.618 --> 00:39:32.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, so time-out.

00:39:32.553 --> 00:39:35.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Taís, we know
you rushed that on purpose,

00:39:35.222 --> 00:39:37.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but how did it make you feel when you did?

00:39:38.292 --> 00:39:41.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, it didn’t feel right
to start witnessing so quickly.

00:39:41.262 --> 00:39:43.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I saw that she wasn’t expecting it.

00:39:43.164 --> 00:39:43.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.

00:39:43.931 --> 00:39:46.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Carolina, how about you?
How did it make you feel?

00:39:46.801 --> 00:39:50.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It started OK,
but then it got awkward real fast.

00:39:50.104 --> 00:39:51.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.

00:39:51.072 --> 00:39:53.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, maybe you can show us

00:39:53.407 --> 00:39:56.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what it’s like when the conversation
will progress more naturally.

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:57.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:39:58.012 --> 00:39:59.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Oi, tudo bem?</i>

00:39:59.246 --> 00:40:01.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I heard you speaking Portuguese.

00:40:01.015 --> 00:40:02.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where are you from?

00:40:02.083 --> 00:40:04.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Oi,</i> I’m from Rio de Janeiro.

00:40:04.585 --> 00:40:06.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, nice.
I’m from São Paulo.

00:40:06.754 --> 00:40:08.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I recognized your accent.

00:40:08.456 --> 00:40:09.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m Taís.

00:40:09.523 --> 00:40:12.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m Carolina.
Nice to meet you.

00:40:12.126 --> 00:40:14.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!
How long have you been here?

00:40:14.195 --> 00:40:16.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only three months.

00:40:16.297 --> 00:40:18.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for me it’s been three years,

00:40:18.933 --> 00:40:21.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the first was the hardest.

00:40:21.769 --> 00:40:24.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we finally have work.

00:40:24.138 --> 00:40:26.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we are still looking for a place to live.

00:40:26.474 --> 00:40:29.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And immigration has been harder
than we thought.

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:31.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!
I’m so sorry.

00:40:31.879 --> 00:40:33.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have family with you?

00:40:33.647 --> 00:40:34.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband.

00:40:34.949 --> 00:40:37.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to leave our son with my mother.

00:40:37.318 --> 00:40:39.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I miss him so much.

00:40:39.286 --> 00:40:41.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow, that’s so hard.

00:40:41.322 --> 00:40:43.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we have to keep trusting in God.

00:40:43.724 --> 00:40:46.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my case, it’s what got me through.

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:49.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know, but I still worry when I don’t know
what He will do for us.

00:40:50.898 --> 00:40:52.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, so let’s stop there.

00:40:52.366 --> 00:40:54.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really nice, thank you.

00:40:54.401 --> 00:40:57.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Taís, where do you feel
the conversation is at at this point?

00:40:57.671 --> 00:41:01.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I felt like I found a good time
to say something about my faith.

00:41:01.809 --> 00:41:04.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now she’s saying how she feels.

00:41:04.545 --> 00:41:06.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nice, excellent.

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:08.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Carolina, how about you?

00:41:08.082 --> 00:41:10.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just a nice conversation.

00:41:10.184 --> 00:41:12.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when she mentioned God,
it was not awkward.

00:41:12.987 --> 00:41:17.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, sisters, for letting us
learn from your conversation.

00:41:17.124 --> 00:41:21.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found that helpful, and I hope you did too.

00:41:21.195 --> 00:41:25.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make it your goal to start conversations
with those three steps:

00:41:25.866 --> 00:41:29.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be friendly, converse naturally,

00:41:29.436 --> 00:41:32.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and find the right time
to express your faith.

00:41:32.573 --> 00:41:35.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Practice at home or with a friend,

00:41:35.609 --> 00:41:39.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see for yourself
how “iron sharpens iron.”

00:41:41.048 --> 00:41:44.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a great demonstration!

00:41:44.218 --> 00:41:47.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Future episodes of <i>Iron Sharpens Iron</i>

00:41:47.388 --> 00:41:51.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will show us more ways
to enhance our skills as ministers.

00:41:53.561 --> 00:41:57.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each of us wants to be a source of comfort

00:41:57.097 --> 00:41:59.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and encouragement to our brothers.

00:41:59.967 --> 00:42:03.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the subject
of a recent morning worship

00:42:03.504 --> 00:42:05.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Brother William Turner.

00:42:07.942 --> 00:42:09.343 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, I think we would agree

00:42:09.343 --> 00:42:11.378 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that it’s very heart-warming to know

00:42:11.378 --> 00:42:14.515 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we serve a God of comfort,

00:42:14.515 --> 00:42:17.117 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and he provides us with so many reminders

00:42:17.117 --> 00:42:20.020 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that highlight the need for us to encourage,

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:22.790 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
strengthen, and comfort one another.

00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:25.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Especially now in the times in which we live,

00:42:25.259 --> 00:42:28.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because none of us know the full weight

00:42:28.729 --> 00:42:31.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what our brothers
here in the Bethel family

00:42:31.332 --> 00:42:35.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our congregations
might be facing or dealing with.

00:42:35.069 --> 00:42:38.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So having and showing empathy

00:42:38.539 --> 00:42:42.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fellow feeling
toward one another is so important.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:48.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps a good example of how not to show
comfort and fellow feeling

00:42:48.515 --> 00:42:52.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is described for us
by Job’s three comforters.

00:42:52.753 --> 00:42:56.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might recall
that they were so busy judging him

00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:58.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and giving Job speeches

00:42:58.025 --> 00:43:01.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they failed to take the time
to understand him

00:43:01.328 --> 00:43:03.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to show fellow feeling.

00:43:03.697 --> 00:43:06.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, in all the talking they did,

00:43:06.166 --> 00:43:10.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not once do we read
that they even addressed Job by name.

00:43:11.705 --> 00:43:15.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  made a statement
regarding these comforters.

00:43:15.943 --> 00:43:18.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said: “Evidently they viewed [Job]

00:43:18.946 --> 00:43:22.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more as a problem than as a person.”

00:43:23.884 --> 00:43:27.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how do you think
that treatment made Job feel?

00:43:27.087 --> 00:43:31.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me in your Bibles
to Job chapter 19,

00:43:33.994 --> 00:43:36.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll listen to Job’s words

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:39.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Job 19:2.

00:43:43.737 --> 00:43:48.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: 
“How long will you keep irritating my soul,

00:43:48.742 --> 00:43:52.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
crushing me with words?”

00:43:52.379 --> 00:43:54.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How sad!

00:43:54.381 --> 00:43:58.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of providing
encouragement and comfort,

00:43:58.619 --> 00:44:02.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those companions
only made Job feel irritated,

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:05.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
crushed, and frustrated.

00:44:06.627 --> 00:44:09.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, doesn’t this highlight
that if we don’t give thoughts

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:12.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our words and actions,

00:44:12.132 --> 00:44:17.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we view our brother
more as a problem than as a person,

00:44:17.104 --> 00:44:19.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we’re not going
to be able to provide them

00:44:19.873 --> 00:44:22.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the comfort
and support they may need?

00:44:23.677 --> 00:44:27.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps we might work with
or we’re in the congregation

00:44:27.481 --> 00:44:31.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with someone that has faults
or traits that bother us,

00:44:31.652 --> 00:44:34.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it may be that these faults

00:44:34.188 --> 00:44:38.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are actually legitimate causes of concern.

00:44:38.025 --> 00:44:40.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in our dealings with them,

00:44:40.294 --> 00:44:44.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if those faults
are the only things that we can see,

00:44:44.031 --> 00:44:46.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if that’s the only thing we focus on,

00:44:46.367 --> 00:44:48.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then it’s going to be very difficult

00:44:48.369 --> 00:44:53.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for us to see them
as a faithful fellow worker of Jehovah.

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:55.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than likely,
all that we’re going to see

00:44:55.843 --> 00:45:00.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is someone who is an obstacle
or impediment to our work,

00:45:00.447 --> 00:45:05.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
someone who is affecting
or impacting our production and joy.

00:45:05.386 --> 00:45:09.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And certainly,
we’re not going to feel good

00:45:09.123 --> 00:45:12.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because now we’ve developed
negative feelings about our brother,

00:45:12.559 --> 00:45:17.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our brother is likely going
to feel the spirit that we give off.

00:45:17.564 --> 00:45:20.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How is that going to affect them?

00:45:20.134 --> 00:45:25.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, like Job, likely they’re going
to be frustrated and irritated,

00:45:25.105 --> 00:45:27.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ve only added to their anxiety.

00:45:28.609 --> 00:45:32.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, obviously, none of us want to have
that sort of effect on our brothers,

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:37.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s why Paul’s words
to the Thessalonians

00:45:37.284 --> 00:45:40.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are a good example worthy of imitation.

00:45:40.888 --> 00:45:42.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we look at this congregation

00:45:42.956 --> 00:45:44.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—practically from the beginning,

00:45:44.925 --> 00:45:47.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the congregation
that was established in Thessalonica—

00:45:47.861 --> 00:45:51.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those brothers and sisters
experienced persecution.

00:45:51.565 --> 00:45:53.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Acts chapter 17,

00:45:53.567 --> 00:45:56.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it mentions that fanatical Jews
stirred up mob violence,

00:45:56.737 --> 00:45:59.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prompting the brothers
to send Paul and Silas away

00:45:59.106 --> 00:46:01.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for their personal safety.

00:46:01.308 --> 00:46:03.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another issue
that was affecting the congregation

00:46:03.944 --> 00:46:07.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was that they
seemingly expressed great sorrow

00:46:07.548 --> 00:46:11.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over losing ones of their number in death.

00:46:11.552 --> 00:46:13.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now think about that.
You have the full picture.

00:46:13.821 --> 00:46:15.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you have a brand new congregation,

00:46:15.823 --> 00:46:17.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’re feeling the heat and pressure

00:46:17.958 --> 00:46:21.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of intense persecution from the outside,

00:46:21.295 --> 00:46:24.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then on the inside,

00:46:24.131 --> 00:46:28.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re feeling the pain
of losing loved ones in death.

00:46:29.803 --> 00:46:34.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that congregation in need
of comfort and encouragement?

00:46:34.208 --> 00:46:36.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without question.

00:46:36.643 --> 00:46:41.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But interestingly, in the midst
of all of this persecution and sadness,

00:46:41.348 --> 00:46:43.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was also discovered that those Christians

00:46:43.851 --> 00:46:47.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were dealing and struggling
with some personal weaknesses.

00:46:47.754 --> 00:46:50.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you look at 1 Thessalonians chapter 4,

00:46:50.424 --> 00:46:54.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there they were counseled
to abstain from fornication,

00:46:54.061 --> 00:46:56.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to love one another in fuller measure,

00:46:56.163 --> 00:46:59.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to mind their own business,
to work with their hands.

00:46:59.266 --> 00:47:02.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then in chapter 5,
to stay awake spiritually

00:47:02.803 --> 00:47:05.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to abstain from every form of wickedness

00:47:05.539 --> 00:47:09.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a number of other matters
that needed attention.

00:47:09.309 --> 00:47:11.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, each of those matters

00:47:11.712 --> 00:47:16.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were all legitimate causes of concern.

00:47:16.016 --> 00:47:18.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, Paul felt this was so urgent

00:47:18.619 --> 00:47:22.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he sent them a second letter
which closely followed his first.

00:47:24.224 --> 00:47:27.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what was Paul going to focus on?

00:47:27.628 --> 00:47:30.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would he focus on the problem

00:47:30.497 --> 00:47:32.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the people?

00:47:32.733 --> 00:47:35.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me, please,
to 2 Thessalonians chapter 1.

00:47:35.569 --> 00:47:38.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s note how Paul begins this chapter.

00:47:38.405 --> 00:47:40.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Thessalonians chapter 1,

00:47:43.677 --> 00:47:46.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll read his words
beginning in verse 3.

00:47:49.583 --> 00:47:54.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “We are obligated always
to give thanks to God for you, brothers.

00:47:54.521 --> 00:47:59.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is fitting, 
because your faith is growing exceedingly

00:47:59.426 --> 00:48:04.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the love of each and every one of you
is increasing toward one another.

00:48:04.097 --> 00:48:09.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As a result we ourselves take pride in you
among the congregations of God

00:48:09.036 --> 00:48:12.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because of your endurance
and faith in all your persecutions

00:48:12.873 --> 00:48:15.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the hardships that you are suffering.”

00:48:16.209 --> 00:48:17.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How beautiful!

00:48:17.277 --> 00:48:21.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you note that Paul starts
with specific commendation?

00:48:21.081 --> 00:48:23.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, there were problems
that needed to be addressed,

00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:27.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he starts with their good qualities

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:29.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what they were doing right.

00:48:29.923 --> 00:48:34.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you and I do the same
in our dealings with our brothers?

00:48:34.895 --> 00:48:37.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of first thinking
about what they’re doing wrong,

00:48:37.698 --> 00:48:39.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what do they do right?

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:42.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we appreciate about them?

00:48:42.002 --> 00:48:46.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t it so much better
to focus on their good traits?

00:48:46.139 --> 00:48:50.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The benefits of doing this
is that it helps us to develop

00:48:50.544 --> 00:48:54.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
genuine personal interest in our brothers.

00:48:54.181 --> 00:48:58.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because if our brothers
can sense that we truly care about them,

00:48:58.385 --> 00:49:00.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then it actually puts us in a better position

00:49:00.854 --> 00:49:04.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to assist them with any matters
that may need adjustment.

00:49:04.925 --> 00:49:07.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what we’ll find
is that this personal interest

00:49:07.494 --> 00:49:10.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can start with something
as simple as acknowledgement.

00:49:12.032 --> 00:49:16.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll recall that Job’s false comforters
didn’t even address Job by name.

00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:19.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with the young man Elihu,

00:49:19.072 --> 00:49:21.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he was given the opportunity to speak

00:49:21.575 --> 00:49:23.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(when addressing Job),

00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:27.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he respectfully addressed him by name.

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:29.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Job 33:1,

00:49:29.616 --> 00:49:31.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elihu begins his words by saying:

00:49:31.785 --> 00:49:36.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Job, please hear my words.”

00:49:36.223 --> 00:49:38.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there were many other verses

00:49:38.225 --> 00:49:41.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he used Job’s personal name as well.

00:49:42.229 --> 00:49:44.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think we’d agree
that sometimes it can be so easy

00:49:44.665 --> 00:49:46.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(especially for us as brothers),

00:49:46.667 --> 00:49:49.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get into work mode, business mode

00:49:49.903 --> 00:49:53.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—where we’re just so focused
on getting information,

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:55.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether it’s here at Bethel
or in the congregation—

00:49:55.876 --> 00:49:59.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we could completely forget
to acknowledge

00:49:59.046 --> 00:50:02.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even greet
the brother in front of us.

00:50:02.649 --> 00:50:06.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So what a beautiful reminder
we learn from Elihu!

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:09.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if we go back to Paul,

00:50:09.423 --> 00:50:13.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after his commendation
in 2 Thessalonians chapter 1,

00:50:13.293 --> 00:50:17.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he starts chapter 2
of 2 Thessalonians with the word

00:50:17.431 --> 00:50:19.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“however.”

00:50:19.433 --> 00:50:22.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now there’s a contrast;
there’s a shift in wording,

00:50:22.769 --> 00:50:25.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he begins to address
the problem that some had developed

00:50:25.639 --> 00:50:28.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding a wrong view of Christ’s presence.

00:50:28.809 --> 00:50:33.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we learn from this
that Paul did not sugarcoat or overlook

00:50:33.146 --> 00:50:36.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
issues that needed to be addressed.

00:50:36.149 --> 00:50:38.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He handled them.

00:50:38.151 --> 00:50:40.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he did it in such a way

00:50:40.153 --> 00:50:42.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the brothers were still able to feel

00:50:42.956 --> 00:50:45.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his loving care and concern.

00:50:45.926 --> 00:50:48.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, if you look in verse 13,

00:50:48.995 --> 00:50:52.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll notice he uses
the word “however” again.

00:50:52.232 --> 00:50:54.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So another shift,

00:50:54.334 --> 00:50:59.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but this time shifting back
to words of empathy, love,

00:50:59.039 --> 00:51:01.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and exhortation for his brothers.

00:51:01.641 --> 00:51:05.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul was convinced,
he had a positive conviction,

00:51:05.579 --> 00:51:07.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his brothers would do the right thing.

00:51:08.782 --> 00:51:10.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in review,

00:51:10.784 --> 00:51:15.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we want to be a source
of comfort and encouragement to our brothers,

00:51:15.422 --> 00:51:18.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how important it is that we see them

00:51:18.291 --> 00:51:20.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not as a problem,

00:51:20.327 --> 00:51:22.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not as an impediment to our work,

00:51:22.763 --> 00:51:25.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but as our fellow worker.

00:51:25.232 --> 00:51:28.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And instead of judging, we commend

00:51:28.301 --> 00:51:31.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—showing genuine personal interest
and acknowledgement.

00:51:31.838 --> 00:51:35.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if there is
a legitimate issue of concern,

00:51:35.609 --> 00:51:39.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, we can lovingly address
what needs to be addressed.

00:51:39.212 --> 00:51:44.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s always be remembered more
for our encouragement than our counsel.

00:51:45.085 --> 00:51:48.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we’re able to do this,
then our brothers are going to love us

00:51:48.855 --> 00:51:50.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the way that we deal with them.

00:51:50.924 --> 00:51:53.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But more important, our Heavenly Father,

00:51:53.827 --> 00:51:57.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our God of comfort will love us as well.

00:51:58.932 --> 00:52:02.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our program, we’ve discussed the value

00:52:02.102 --> 00:52:04.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of setting the right priorities.

00:52:04.838 --> 00:52:08.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is particularly important
during our youth,

00:52:08.175 --> 00:52:12.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re encouraged
to give our best years to Jehovah.

00:52:12.679 --> 00:52:15.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As our new song reminds us,

00:52:15.382 --> 00:52:19.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will never regret making that a priority.

00:52:22.022 --> 00:52:27.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you were younger,
life seemed so simple.

00:52:27.427 --> 00:52:32.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You did your best
to do what’s right—

00:52:32.132 --> 00:52:37.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Giving answers
and preaching the good news;

00:52:37.137 --> 00:52:41.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You would pray each
and ev’ry night.

00:52:41.808 --> 00:52:46.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as you got older,
with this world trying to mold you,

00:52:46.746 --> 00:52:51.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Suddenly it was not so easy
to be knocking on those doors.

00:52:51.651 --> 00:52:56.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as you get taller,
smarter, trying to work harder,

00:52:56.323 --> 00:53:02.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never let go of Jehovah.
The best is still in store.

00:53:03.964 --> 00:53:09.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have a treasured place
in Jehovah’s house;

00:53:09.502 --> 00:53:13.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll help you out.

00:53:13.306 --> 00:53:18.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you have so much to offer,
so much to do.

00:53:18.945 --> 00:53:27.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sees your faith;
Know he treasures you.

00:53:31.691 --> 00:53:37.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now you are older
and dealing with changes,

00:53:37.097 --> 00:53:41.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like all the trials
have just begun.

00:53:41.701 --> 00:53:46.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Growing anxious
from all of your fears—

00:53:46.373 --> 00:53:51.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talk to God;
he always listens.

00:53:51.478 --> 00:53:55.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as you get wiser,
find the ways you can apply

00:53:55.815 --> 00:54:01.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The truth in your life
and feel the joy of sacrifice.

00:54:01.221 --> 00:54:05.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as you get taller,
smarter, trying to work harder,

00:54:05.792 --> 00:54:13.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never let go of Jehovah.
The best is still in store.

00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:19.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have a treasured place
in Jehovah’s house;

00:54:19.172 --> 00:54:23.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll help you out.

00:54:23.009 --> 00:54:28.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you have so much to offer,
so much to do.

00:54:28.548 --> 00:54:37.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sees your faith;
Know he treasures you.

00:54:43.029 --> 00:54:47.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So use your strength
for Jehovah’s name.

00:54:47.901 --> 00:54:52.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You won’t regret it;

In this month’s program,

00:56:06.279 --> 00:56:09.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we learned the value of maintaining balance.

00:56:09.783 --> 00:56:13.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We cannot let our spiritual routine suffer,

00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:16.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even for theocratic privileges.

00:56:17.290 --> 00:56:21.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sharon Hall made sacrifices
to do more for Jehovah,

00:56:21.261 --> 00:56:23.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she received many blessings.

00:56:25.799 --> 00:56:28.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw how teens use

00:56:28.401 --> 00:56:31.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their power of reason
to prove to themselves

00:56:31.671 --> 00:56:33.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God exists.

00:56:34.274 --> 00:56:36.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the first episode of our new series,

00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:38.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Iron Sharpens Iron,</i>

00:56:38.912 --> 00:56:42.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showed how we can start conversations

00:56:42.015 --> 00:56:44.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by being alert for opportunities

00:56:44.350 --> 00:56:47.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and by being friendly and kind.

00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:50.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:56:50.290 --> 00:56:54.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s visit our brothers and sisters
in Madagascar.

00:56:54.994 --> 00:56:58.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lying off the east coast of Africa,

00:56:58.665 --> 00:57:02.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Madagascar is the fourth largest island
in the world.

00:57:02.702 --> 00:57:07.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Its climate and diverse terrain make it

00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:12.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a sanctuary for an amazing variety
of plants and animals.

00:57:13.179 --> 00:57:15.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The baobab tree is known

00:57:15.148 --> 00:57:17.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for its barrel-shaped trunk

00:57:17.717 --> 00:57:20.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and extraordinary longevity.

00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:22.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are nine species

00:57:22.455 --> 00:57:25.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of baobab in the world.

00:57:25.291 --> 00:57:29.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Six can be found only in Madagascar.

00:57:29.162 --> 00:57:32.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About 40 different species

00:57:32.132 --> 00:57:34.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of lemur live here.

00:57:34.167 --> 00:57:38.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Among them is the ring-tailed lemur,

00:57:38.037 --> 00:57:42.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this one is called Coquerel’s sifaka.

00:57:42.075 --> 00:57:45.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rice fields dot many parts of the country.

00:57:45.378 --> 00:57:49.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rice is the staple food
of the Malagasy people.

00:57:51.251 --> 00:57:55.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Antsirabe is Madagascar’s third largest city

00:57:55.288 --> 00:57:58.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and home to 34 congregations.

00:57:58.825 --> 00:58:03.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since few in Madagascar have running water,

00:58:03.129 --> 00:58:06.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many people can be contacted
while they do their laundry

00:58:06.132 --> 00:58:08.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in rivers and lakes.

00:58:08.334 --> 00:58:11.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:58:11.204 --> 00:58:16.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a remote community on the southeastern coast.

00:58:16.075 --> 00:58:20.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers share the good news
despite frequent rain showers

00:58:20.346 --> 00:58:24.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the great distances
they have to walk between villages.

00:58:26.653 --> 00:58:31.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Response to the Kingdom message is strong,
and many ask for a Bible study.

00:58:32.192 --> 00:58:36.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here, two sisters are conducting a study

00:58:36.162 --> 00:58:38.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while others wait their turn.

00:58:38.464 --> 00:58:40.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interested ones

00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:43.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

So to download big video files

00:58:53.546 --> 00:58:55.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as convention videos,

00:58:55.648 --> 00:59:00.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this elder and other brothers
travel 12 hours,

00:59:00.253 --> 00:59:02.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mainly by boat, to the nearest town.

00:59:05.024 --> 00:59:07.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
