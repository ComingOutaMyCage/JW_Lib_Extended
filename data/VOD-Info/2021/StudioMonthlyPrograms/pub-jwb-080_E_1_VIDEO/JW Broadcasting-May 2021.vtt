Welcome, brothers and sisters.

00:00:04.988 --> 00:00:07.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this month’s program,

00:00:07.323 --> 00:00:10.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll review who the May 2020 <i>Watchtower</i>

00:00:10.326 --> 00:00:13.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
identified as “the king of the north,”

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:15.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll learn how knowing this

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
affects each one of us.

00:00:18.068 --> 00:00:21.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll also see
how perseverance helps us

00:00:21.504 --> 00:00:24.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reach our spiritual goals.

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:28.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ll debut an exciting new series

00:00:28.344 --> 00:00:31.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made especially for teenagers.

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:38.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is JW Broadcasting for May 2021.

00:00:58.808 --> 00:01:03.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My theme is “‘The King of the North’
in the Time of the End.”

00:01:03.546 --> 00:01:06.683 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In recent years, the Russian government

00:01:06.683 --> 00:01:09.319 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
has persecuted our brothers and sisters

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:11.321 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
who live in that country.

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:15.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve heard reports
about the police invading Kingdom Halls

00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:17.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and breaking up meetings.

00:01:17.393 --> 00:01:20.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The government has labeled
Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as an “extremist group.”

00:01:22.565 --> 00:01:27.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has seized our properties
and imprisoned our brothers.

00:01:27.137 --> 00:01:29.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please watch a brief video

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:31.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that reviews some of the trials

00:01:31.274 --> 00:01:34.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people in Russia have faced.

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On April 20, 2017,

00:01:38.548 --> 00:01:41.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Supreme Court
of the Russian Federation criminalized

00:01:41.785 --> 00:01:43.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:01:46.956 --> 00:01:49.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As of July 4, 2019,

00:01:49.592 --> 00:01:53.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
authorities have progressively
seized 131 of the properties

00:01:53.463 --> 00:01:56.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
owned by Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:01:56.065 --> 00:01:58.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with an additional 60 properties
subject to confiscation.

00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:00.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the seized properties

00:02:00.737 --> 00:02:02.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the former
Russia branch complex in Solnechnoye.

00:02:05.441 --> 00:02:08.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the time of filming,
the Russian authorities continue

00:02:08.111 --> 00:02:11.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their aggressive attack
on Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:14.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As of August 17, 2020,

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were 42 Witnesses
who were in pretrial detention

00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:19.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or sentenced to prison,

00:02:19.322 --> 00:02:22.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
32 who were under house arrest,

00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:25.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 169 who were not allowed
to leave their hometown.

00:02:25.695 --> 00:02:28.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All have been charged with organizing,

00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:31.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
participating in, or financing the activity

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:33.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a so-called “extremist” organization.

00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:38.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At least 380 Witnesses were,
at the time, under investigation

00:02:38.808 --> 00:02:42.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—ranging in age from 19 to 89 years old.

00:02:43.713 --> 00:02:46.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What has this meant
for the individuals affected?

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As an example,

00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:50.520 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on June 3, 2018,

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.023 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Brother Sergey Klimov was arrested.

00:02:54.023 --> 00:02:55.992 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Local authorities initiated

00:02:55.992 --> 00:02:57.827 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
criminal charges against him,

00:02:57.827 --> 00:03:00.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
placing him
in pretrial detention for two months.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This detention was extended seven times,

00:03:04.067 --> 00:03:06.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
separating him from his wife and family

00:03:06.135 --> 00:03:08.304 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for a year and five months,

00:03:08.304 --> 00:03:10.740 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
before he was finally tried and sentenced.

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:14.110 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
On November 5, 2019,

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.547 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
he was sentenced to six years in prison.

00:03:22.051 --> 00:03:24.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two of our dear young people in Russia,

00:03:24.187 --> 00:03:27.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Yegor Baranov
and Sister Darya Dulova,

00:03:27.257 --> 00:03:29.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are courageously facing criminal conviction

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:31.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and potential long-term imprisonment.

00:03:33.196 --> 00:03:35.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Baranov is only 19 years old.

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:40.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the authorities raided her home,
Sister Dulova was only 18 years old.

00:03:43.106 --> 00:03:45.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By means of the Newsroom on jw.org,

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:47.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are informed of updated news events.

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:49.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This page includes links to name lists

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:52.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Witnesses
currently imprisoned for their faith,

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:55.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which can help us include
them specifically in our prayers.

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:59.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters in Russia
are resolved to remain loyal to Jehovah

00:03:59.822 --> 00:04:02.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite any opposition,

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:05.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they put their confidence
in him in the assurance

00:04:05.094 --> 00:04:07.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is on their side!

00:04:20.276 --> 00:04:22.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It shouldn’t surprise us

00:04:22.278 --> 00:04:25.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this powerful government
has been persecuting

00:04:25.581 --> 00:04:29.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our peaceful,
law-abiding brothers and sisters.

00:04:29.585 --> 00:04:31.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not?

00:04:31.321 --> 00:04:36.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because that government
is fulfilling Bible prophecy!

00:04:36.225 --> 00:04:40.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please find Daniel chapter 11.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 40, it refers
to what the Bible calls

00:04:44.233 --> 00:04:46.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the king of the north.”

00:04:46.235 --> 00:04:50.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of that “king,” Daniel 11:41 says:

00:04:50.506 --> 00:04:55.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He will also enter
into the land of the Decoration,

00:04:55.445 --> 00:05:00.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many lands will be made to stumble.”

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, Russia and its allies

00:05:03.486 --> 00:05:07.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are filling the role
of the king of the north.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel foretold that this king would enter

00:05:10.293 --> 00:05:12.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the land of the Decoration,”

00:05:12.328 --> 00:05:16.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meaning that he would interfere
in a significant way

00:05:16.032 --> 00:05:19.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the activities of God’s people.

00:05:19.202 --> 00:05:22.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As discussed in the May 2020 <i>Watchtower,</i>

00:05:22.805 --> 00:05:26.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Russia and its allies
are not the first political power

00:05:26.376 --> 00:05:28.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to act as the king of the north,

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:32.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they may well be the last.

00:05:32.615 --> 00:05:36.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this program, we will do three things:

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:36.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First,

00:05:36.953 --> 00:05:40.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll briefly trace
the fulfillment of the prophecy

00:05:40.556 --> 00:05:44.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recorded in Daniel chapter 11.

00:05:44.027 --> 00:05:47.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, we’ll look at how that prophecy

00:05:47.463 --> 00:05:50.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is being fulfilled today.

00:05:50.033 --> 00:05:54.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And third, we’ll discuss
how knowing this information

00:05:54.037 --> 00:05:57.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should affect the decisions that we make.

00:05:58.508 --> 00:06:02.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Herman van Selm,
a helper to the Writing Committee,

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:06.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help us review
some of the key points of the prophecy

00:06:06.516 --> 00:06:09.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recorded in Daniel chapter 11.

00:06:10.386 --> 00:06:14.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Herman,
for helping me with this presentation.

00:06:14.057 --> 00:06:16.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a pleasure to be with you, Ken.

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:19.395 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for inviting me.

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:22.665 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
First, let’s briefly trace

00:06:22.665 --> 00:06:26.369 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
how the prophecy has been fulfilled so far.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.772 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The prophecy in Daniel chapter 11 mentions

00:06:29.772 --> 00:06:32.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the king of the north”
and “the king of the south.”

00:06:32.608 --> 00:06:35.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why are they described like that?

00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:37.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, initially,

00:06:37.213 --> 00:06:41.350 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
these powers were located north and south

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.719 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the literal land of Israel,

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:46.022 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
thus the names king of the north

00:06:46.022 --> 00:06:47.356 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and king of the south.

00:06:48.458 --> 00:06:52.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These powers could be viewed as two thrones.

00:06:52.395 --> 00:06:55.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over time, those thrones have been occupied

00:06:55.264 --> 00:06:57.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by various political powers

00:06:57.266 --> 00:07:01.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and these rival kings compete
for world domination.

00:07:01.571 --> 00:07:03.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about Jehovah’s people?

00:07:03.973 --> 00:07:08.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are right at the center
of this conflict.

00:07:09.312 --> 00:07:12.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s start at the beginning.

00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:13.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ken,

00:07:13.316 --> 00:07:17.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what is the origin
of the kings of the north and of the south?

00:07:18.788 --> 00:07:21.357 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The kings of the north and of the south

00:07:21.357 --> 00:07:23.593 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
both rose from the empire

00:07:23.593 --> 00:07:26.696 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
established by Alexander the Great.

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:29.132 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
One line of kings ruled over Egypt,

00:07:29.132 --> 00:07:31.267 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
which is south of Israel.

00:07:31.267 --> 00:07:33.769 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And that dynasty was the first

00:07:33.769 --> 00:07:37.340 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to fill the role of king of the south.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.976 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
During this period, another line of kings

00:07:39.976 --> 00:07:42.845 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
ruled an area north of Israel

00:07:42.845 --> 00:07:45.081 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and those kings filled the role

00:07:45.081 --> 00:07:47.083 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of king of the north.

00:07:47.083 --> 00:07:50.453 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Then the Roman Empire took over

00:07:50.453 --> 00:07:52.788 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
as king of the north.

00:07:53.856 --> 00:07:57.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As discussed in the May 2020 <i>Watchtower,</i>

00:07:57.093 --> 00:07:59.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s people are the focal point

00:07:59.428 --> 00:08:03.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the prophecy
recorded in Daniel chapter 11.

00:08:03.799 --> 00:08:07.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The angel who spoke with Daniel
said that the prophecy

00:08:07.136 --> 00:08:12.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would help him
“understand what will befall your people”

00:08:12.008 --> 00:08:15.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is, the nation of Israel.

00:08:16.812 --> 00:08:19.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what, in fact, happened?

00:08:19.182 --> 00:08:24.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Jewish nation
was God’s people until 33 C.E.

00:08:24.153 --> 00:08:26.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But after that, a change occurred.

00:08:26.656 --> 00:08:29.258 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah poured out his holy spirit

00:08:29.258 --> 00:08:30.593 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on Christ’s followers.

00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:32.261 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And from then on,

00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:34.664 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the congregation of true Christians

00:08:34.664 --> 00:08:36.832 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
became God’s people.

00:08:38.401 --> 00:08:41.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Galatians 6:16 refers to them

00:08:41.537 --> 00:08:45.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “the Israel of God.”

00:08:45.274 --> 00:08:47.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That point is significant

00:08:47.877 --> 00:08:52.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the kings of the north and south
can only be identified

00:08:52.348 --> 00:08:57.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when there is a clearly defined group
of God’s people on earth.

00:08:57.286 --> 00:08:59.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is that the case?

00:08:59.655 --> 00:09:02.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because, as we just considered,

00:09:02.058 --> 00:09:04.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the angel had told Daniel

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the prophecy centers on God’s people.

00:09:08.564 --> 00:09:11.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the second century C.E.,

00:09:11.367 --> 00:09:14.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
true Christians were overgrown

00:09:14.303 --> 00:09:17.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by weedlike false Christians.

00:09:17.273 --> 00:09:19.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In his illustration
of the wheat and the weeds,

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:22.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus foretold that this would happen.

00:09:22.845 --> 00:09:24.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That illustration is recorded

00:09:24.847 --> 00:09:29.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Matthew 13:36-43.

00:09:29.418 --> 00:09:33.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So from the second century onward,

00:09:33.055 --> 00:09:37.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can no longer identify
an organized group of true Christians.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, as we considered, for that same reason,

00:09:40.263 --> 00:09:42.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we also cannot identify

00:09:42.498 --> 00:09:45.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the king of the north
and the king of the south.

00:09:45.568 --> 00:09:50.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in the 1870’s, a group of Bible students

00:09:50.072 --> 00:09:53.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
began to separate itself
from false Christians.

00:09:53.476 --> 00:09:54.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This group,

00:09:54.744 --> 00:09:57.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which included Charles T. Russell,

00:09:57.146 --> 00:09:58.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rejected teachings

00:09:58.781 --> 00:10:01.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were not based on the Bible.

00:10:01.284 --> 00:10:03.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like the first-century Christians,

00:10:03.953 --> 00:10:05.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they promoted the truths

00:10:05.955 --> 00:10:07.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taught in God’s Word.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:11.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now this group underwent a development

00:10:11.427 --> 00:10:15.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is foretold at Malachi 3:1.

00:10:15.831 --> 00:10:18.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were the “messenger”

00:10:18.134 --> 00:10:21.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would “clear up a way” before Jehovah.

00:10:21.971 --> 00:10:24.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as events that followed prove,

00:10:24.907 --> 00:10:28.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this group clearly had God’s backing.

00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:30.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So from the 1870’s onward,

00:10:30.646 --> 00:10:34.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when true Christians began
to organize themselves as a group,

00:10:34.917 --> 00:10:38.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can again identify the political powers

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that fill the roles of the king of the north

00:10:41.324 --> 00:10:43.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and king of the south.

00:10:43.526 --> 00:10:46.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time in history,

00:10:46.629 --> 00:10:49.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Britain was the dominant political force

00:10:49.932 --> 00:10:51.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it filled the role

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the king of the south.

00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:57.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amazingly, it was also in the 1870’s

00:10:57.807 --> 00:11:00.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the German Empire emerged

00:11:00.176 --> 00:11:02.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and soon began to challenge Britain

00:11:02.478 --> 00:11:04.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for world domination.

00:11:04.513 --> 00:11:07.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This political power now filled the role

00:11:07.783 --> 00:11:09.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the king of the north.

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:14.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel 11:25, 26 indicate

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:17.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the two kings would clash

00:11:17.126 --> 00:11:21.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that the king of the north
would lose many soldiers in the battle.

00:11:21.497 --> 00:11:25.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is exactly what happened

00:11:25.267 --> 00:11:26.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during World War I.

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:28.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was during that war

00:11:28.938 --> 00:11:31.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Britain and its close ally,

00:11:31.674 --> 00:11:33.342 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the United States,

00:11:33.342 --> 00:11:35.911 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
forged a special bond.

00:11:35.911 --> 00:11:38.147 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So from this point on,

00:11:38.147 --> 00:11:39.949 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
during these last days,

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:42.218 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Anglo-American power

00:11:42.218 --> 00:11:44.553 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
has been the king of the south.

00:11:45.888 --> 00:11:48.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That brings us to our second point:

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:52.762 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
How has Daniel chapter 11 been fulfilled

00:11:52.762 --> 00:11:54.997 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from that time onward

00:11:54.997 --> 00:11:57.199 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
until recent times?

00:11:57.199 --> 00:11:59.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During World War I,

00:11:59.368 --> 00:12:02.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the king of the north
and the king of the south

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:07.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
persecuted those of God’s people
who refused to fight in the war.

00:12:07.743 --> 00:12:10.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The king of the south even threw into jail

00:12:10.579 --> 00:12:13.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those who were taking the lead
in the preaching work.

00:12:13.749 --> 00:12:17.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s take a closer look
at the king of the north.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Has the political power filling that role

00:12:20.489 --> 00:12:23.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
changed during the last days?

00:12:23.259 --> 00:12:26.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how has it treated God’s people?

00:12:26.862 --> 00:12:29.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The identity of the king of the north

00:12:29.131 --> 00:12:32.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has changed three times during the last days.

00:12:32.902 --> 00:12:37.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Starting in the 1870’s
through to the end of the second world war,

00:12:37.673 --> 00:12:39.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the German Empire

00:12:39.675 --> 00:12:42.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
filled the role of the king of the north.

00:12:42.845 --> 00:12:47.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the period leading up to
and including World War II,

00:12:47.116 --> 00:12:50.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it persecuted God’s people without mercy,

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imprisoning thousands of our brothers

00:12:53.823 --> 00:12:56.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and killing hundreds of them.

00:12:56.759 --> 00:13:00.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who replaced the German Empire
as the king of the north?

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.799 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That’s an important question, Herman.

00:13:03.799 --> 00:13:05.401 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
After World War II,

00:13:05.401 --> 00:13:08.037 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Soviet Union took on that role.

00:13:08.037 --> 00:13:10.506 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It also attacked God’s people,

00:13:10.506 --> 00:13:14.276 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
imprisoning them or sending them into exile.

00:13:15.511 --> 00:13:18.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, Ken, Daniel 11:34 says

00:13:18.681 --> 00:13:21.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they—that is, God’s people—

00:13:21.717 --> 00:13:24.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be “given a little help.”

00:13:24.587 --> 00:13:27.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the significance of that statement?

00:13:27.356 --> 00:13:30.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This passage points forward to the time

00:13:30.159 --> 00:13:33.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the Soviet Union collapsed.

00:13:33.028 --> 00:13:36.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although God’s people suffered terribly
under that government,

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:39.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were “given a little help.”

00:13:39.735 --> 00:13:41.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In what way?

00:13:41.737 --> 00:13:44.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the USSR collapsed,

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:48.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s people there could worship freely
for a number of years.

00:13:48.777 --> 00:13:51.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In time, though, Russia and its allies

00:13:51.981 --> 00:13:55.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
took on the role of the king of the north.

00:13:55.684 --> 00:13:59.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like the other powers
that filled the role of king of the north,

00:13:59.822 --> 00:14:04.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this government has continued to oppress
God’s people.

00:14:04.627 --> 00:14:07.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch the following video

00:14:07.029 --> 00:14:09.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that outlines what has happened.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel received a prophecy

00:14:16.772 --> 00:14:18.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the coming of two rivals:

00:14:18.774 --> 00:14:20.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the king of the north”

00:14:20.643 --> 00:14:23.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “the king of the south.”

00:14:23.045 --> 00:14:25.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How has it been fulfilled?

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.823 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In the late 1800’s, the German Empire

00:14:34.823 --> 00:14:36.859 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
became the king of the north.

00:14:36.859 --> 00:14:38.327 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That government brought

00:14:38.327 --> 00:14:39.628 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
its “power and . . . heart

00:14:39.628 --> 00:14:40.963 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“against the king of the south

00:14:40.963 --> 00:14:43.532 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with a large army.”

00:14:43.532 --> 00:14:45.734 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In fact, its navy was

00:14:45.734 --> 00:14:48.203 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the second largest on earth.

00:14:50.072 --> 00:14:53.208 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Who became the king of the south?

00:14:53.208 --> 00:14:55.210 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The alliance between Britain

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:57.413 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the United States.

00:14:57.413 --> 00:14:59.415 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He fought during World War I

00:14:59.415 --> 00:15:01.417 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“with an exceedingly large

00:15:01.417 --> 00:15:03.319 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and mighty army.”

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:05.721 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He “swept away” and “humbled”

00:15:05.721 --> 00:15:07.923 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the king of the north.

00:15:09.091 --> 00:15:10.492 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But that was not the end

00:15:10.492 --> 00:15:12.595 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the king of the north.

00:15:12.595 --> 00:15:14.730 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He turned his attention to and then hurled

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:17.733 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“denunciations against the holy covenant.”

00:15:19.335 --> 00:15:21.604 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He removed “the constant feature”

00:15:21.604 --> 00:15:23.606 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by limiting the freedom of God’s people

00:15:23.606 --> 00:15:26.408 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to preach,

00:15:26.408 --> 00:15:28.677 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
imprisoning many,

00:15:28.677 --> 00:15:30.679 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and even killing hundreds

00:15:30.679 --> 00:15:31.914 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of God’s anointed ones

00:15:31.914 --> 00:15:33.916 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and their fellow workers.

00:15:36.018 --> 00:15:38.520 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
After Germany was defeated in World War II,

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.556 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Soviet Union

00:15:40.556 --> 00:15:42.625 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
became the king of the north.

00:15:42.625 --> 00:15:44.627 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It worked with the king of the south

00:15:44.627 --> 00:15:47.029 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to “put in place the disgusting thing

00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:49.531 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that causes desolation”

00:15:49.531 --> 00:15:51.734 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—the United Nations.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.812 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Beginning in the early 1900’s,

00:16:03.812 --> 00:16:06.115 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Soviet government tried to eliminate

00:16:06.115 --> 00:16:08.751 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
religion in the lands under its control,

00:16:10.452 --> 00:16:11.887 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
fulfilling the words

00:16:11.887 --> 00:16:13.455 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that he would “show no regard

00:16:13.455 --> 00:16:15.658 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for the God of his fathers.”

00:16:19.662 --> 00:16:22.564 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He gave glory, not to the God of heaven,

00:16:22.564 --> 00:16:25.434 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but “to the god of fortresses.”

00:16:26.468 --> 00:16:28.070 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
As prophesied,

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.905 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
he used this military might

00:16:29.905 --> 00:16:31.440 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
against the king of the south

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.010 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by engaging “with him in a pushing.”

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:36.078 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Anglo-America competed

00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:37.179 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with the Soviet Union

00:16:37.179 --> 00:16:39.148 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for world domination,

00:16:39.148 --> 00:16:41.283 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
fighting in and supporting wars

00:16:41.283 --> 00:16:43.752 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and political struggles around the globe.

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:51.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991,

00:16:51.994 --> 00:16:54.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was unclear who would fill the role
of the king of the north.

00:16:55.664 --> 00:16:57.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a time, God’s people there

00:16:57.733 --> 00:17:00.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had been able to preach
and worship peacefully.

00:17:01.637 --> 00:17:04.673 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But in recent years, Russia and its allies

00:17:04.673 --> 00:17:07.609 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
have pushed back at the king of the south.

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:09.611 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Both kings have accused each other

00:17:09.611 --> 00:17:12.781 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of destructive cyber and economic attacks.

00:17:13.649 --> 00:17:16.051 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But the king of the north has not limited

00:17:16.051 --> 00:17:18.387 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
his attacks to the king of the south.

00:17:18.387 --> 00:17:20.456 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
As foretold, he also entered

00:17:20.456 --> 00:17:23.859 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“into the land of the Decoration”

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:26.061 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—our realm of spiritual activity.

00:17:27.496 --> 00:17:29.565 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Today, Russian authorities continue

00:17:29.565 --> 00:17:31.800 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to attack true worship.

00:17:33.535 --> 00:17:36.672 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We expect such persecution,

00:17:36.672 --> 00:17:40.042 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but we also expect it to end.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our King, Jesus Christ,

00:18:00.395 --> 00:18:03.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is more powerful than any human government.

00:18:05.868 --> 00:18:10.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon he will destroy
not only the kings of the north and the south

00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:13.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but all of his enemies,

00:18:13.442 --> 00:18:17.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will deliver God’s loyal people.

00:18:47.009 --> 00:18:51.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a powerful and touching video!

00:18:51.547 --> 00:18:55.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How are our brothers and sisters coping
with the current persecution?

00:18:55.818 --> 00:18:57.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take a look.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:01.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what you’re going to see
will break your heart

00:19:01.924 --> 00:19:04.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also strengthen your faith.

00:19:06.862 --> 00:19:08.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 6:00 a.m.,

00:19:08.864 --> 00:19:10.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my husband and I were woken up

00:19:10.866 --> 00:19:13.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by a loud bang on the door.

00:19:13.202 --> 00:19:15.270 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
As soon as my husband had opened the door,

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:17.339 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
people burst in shouting,

00:19:17.339 --> 00:19:19.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Everyone on the floor!”

00:19:19.208 --> 00:19:21.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw them taking my husband into the kitchen

00:19:21.877 --> 00:19:23.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and heard them

00:19:23.445 --> 00:19:25.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
very aggressively
ordering him to do something.

00:19:25.447 --> 00:19:27.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I heard some noise, and I realized

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:30.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he was being beaten.

00:19:30.385 --> 00:19:32.554 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My husband, Feliks, and I

00:19:32.554 --> 00:19:35.357 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were on our way back from the shopping mall

00:19:35.357 --> 00:19:36.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the car park.

00:19:36.859 --> 00:19:38.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A jeep with tinted windows

00:19:38.293 --> 00:19:40.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
blocked our path, and people

00:19:40.028 --> 00:19:42.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with weapons
jumped out, shouting:

00:19:42.164 --> 00:19:44.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On the ground!
Don’t move!”

00:19:45.234 --> 00:19:47.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were thrown against the vehicle.

00:19:47.636 --> 00:19:50.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Feliks was sent
to a pretrial detention facility,

00:19:50.672 --> 00:19:52.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he spent a year.

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:57.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the very first bang on the door,

00:19:57.012 --> 00:20:01.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began praying to Jehovah
for wisdom, calmness,

00:20:01.316 --> 00:20:04.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for holy spirit
so that I could make the right decisions

00:20:04.186 --> 00:20:05.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and act in the right way.

00:20:05.454 --> 00:20:07.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for the whole day, I was praying.

00:20:07.623 --> 00:20:09.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah answered all my prayers,

00:20:09.591 --> 00:20:12.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I felt that he was close at my side.

00:20:16.565 --> 00:20:19.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before each court hearing
when I was very afraid

00:20:19.201 --> 00:20:22.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and felt overwhelmed by emotion
and couldn’t calm myself down,

00:20:22.504 --> 00:20:24.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was prayer

00:20:24.873 --> 00:20:26.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that helped me to settle down.

00:20:28.243 --> 00:20:30.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they took us for interrogation,

00:20:30.946 --> 00:20:34.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started panicking and, at that moment,

00:20:34.216 --> 00:20:37.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that I needed
to meditate on something positive.

00:20:37.185 --> 00:20:39.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I thought,

00:20:39.221 --> 00:20:41.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I need to sing our songs.’

00:20:41.223 --> 00:20:44.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just one song came into my mind:

00:20:44.626 --> 00:20:46.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He Will Make You Strong.”

00:20:46.628 --> 00:20:48.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really strengthened me.

00:20:49.364 --> 00:20:51.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those words
about how Jehovah gave his Son for us

00:20:51.867 --> 00:20:54.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
show he loves us and will never leave us.

00:20:56.872 --> 00:20:58.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters

00:20:58.907 --> 00:21:01.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pray and tell me

00:21:01.243 --> 00:21:03.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they are praying for me.

00:21:03.378 --> 00:21:05.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It gives me the feeling that I am part

00:21:05.814 --> 00:21:07.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a large family.

00:21:09.518 --> 00:21:12.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the interrogation,

00:21:12.087 --> 00:21:13.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was sent home.

00:21:13.822 --> 00:21:15.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband and I

00:21:15.757 --> 00:21:18.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
continue to stick to our spiritual routine.

00:21:19.428 --> 00:21:23.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We continue to conduct family worship,
and we are always in the ministry.

00:21:24.266 --> 00:21:27.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters
constantly support us.

00:21:27.836 --> 00:21:29.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They write kind words;

00:21:29.438 --> 00:21:32.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they commend us;

00:21:32.407 --> 00:21:34.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they send us
encouraging scriptures from the Bible.

00:21:36.311 --> 00:21:40.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In September 2019, Feliks was found guilty

00:21:40.949 --> 00:21:43.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sentenced to three years
in a general regime colony.

00:21:45.988 --> 00:21:48.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he and the other brothers arrived there,

00:21:48.924 --> 00:21:50.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were beaten up by officers
from the colony.

00:21:54.329 --> 00:21:55.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Feliks told me

00:21:55.664 --> 00:21:57.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he prayed
while he was being beaten,

00:21:59.267 --> 00:22:02.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he noticed that at that moment,
he stopped feeling the pain.

00:22:06.375 --> 00:22:08.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While he is behind bars,

00:22:08.443 --> 00:22:11.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Feliks tries to conduct
family worship with me by letters.

00:22:13.248 --> 00:22:16.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He picks certain themes
and some specific questions.

00:22:17.119 --> 00:22:19.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I do research

00:22:19.187 --> 00:22:21.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the publications
and send back what I find.

00:22:24.459 --> 00:22:27.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The scripture at Isaiah chapter 30
really strengthens me,

00:22:27.629 --> 00:22:30.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it says that “your strength will be

00:22:30.932 --> 00:22:33.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in keeping calm and showing trust.”

00:22:34.336 --> 00:22:36.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although I tend to worry,

00:22:37.739 --> 00:22:40.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I understand that calmness is expressed

00:22:40.409 --> 00:22:42.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by fully trusting in Jehovah.

00:22:44.613 --> 00:22:47.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have become stronger
because thanks to Jehovah,

00:22:47.749 --> 00:22:51.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way, I have developed almost a shell

00:22:51.486 --> 00:22:53.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against the difficulties

00:22:53.488 --> 00:22:54.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that used to scare me.

00:22:54.523 --> 00:22:56.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That confidence and faith help me.

00:22:56.558 --> 00:22:58.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was with me,

00:22:58.627 --> 00:23:00.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will remain

00:23:00.162 --> 00:23:01.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
close by me,

00:23:01.496 --> 00:23:03.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will be made stronger thanks to him,

00:23:03.865 --> 00:23:07.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will get through these trials.

00:23:10.439 --> 00:23:13.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we develop courage

00:23:13.275 --> 00:23:16.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like our brothers and sisters in Russia?

00:23:16.445 --> 00:23:19.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we must be convinced

00:23:19.714 --> 00:23:24.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the prophecies in the Bible
are trustworthy.

00:23:24.219 --> 00:23:26.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a topic discussed

00:23:26.254 --> 00:23:29.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Brother David Splane of the Governing Body

00:23:29.057 --> 00:23:32.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the following Morning Worship program.

00:23:33.628 --> 00:23:35.063 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you’d just

00:23:35.063 --> 00:23:37.099 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
take a look at today’s text,

00:23:38.533 --> 00:23:42.537 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
it says: “Come and witness

00:23:42.537 --> 00:23:46.808 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the activities of Jehovah”—witness.

00:23:47.642 --> 00:23:49.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, according to a dictionary,

00:23:49.644 --> 00:23:54.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a witness is someone
who has personal knowledge of something.

00:23:54.449 --> 00:23:58.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how can we be Witnesses of Jehovah?

00:23:58.653 --> 00:24:01.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What personal knowledge

00:24:01.356 --> 00:24:04.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do we have of his activities?

00:24:04.526 --> 00:24:08.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, first of all,
we can testify to the fact

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:10.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah can see into the future.

00:24:10.732 --> 00:24:14.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when he does that,
he is right 100 percent of the time.

00:24:14.503 --> 00:24:18.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And second, we know that no one can prevent

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what Jehovah foresees from coming true.

00:24:21.243 --> 00:24:25.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of Jehovah’s prophecies come true.

00:24:25.814 --> 00:24:28.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, to illustrate the first point,

00:24:28.316 --> 00:24:30.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah can see into the future,

00:24:30.519 --> 00:24:33.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s consider two remarkable prophecies

00:24:33.989 --> 00:24:38.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
concerning the destruction
of Jerusalem and its temple.

00:24:38.994 --> 00:24:42.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we know that
through the prophet Jeremiah,

00:24:42.197 --> 00:24:45.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah foretold
that Jerusalem and the temple

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be destroyed by the Babylonians.

00:24:47.202 --> 00:24:49.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did it come true?

00:24:49.237 --> 00:24:53.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely—in 607 B.C.E.

00:24:53.008 --> 00:24:55.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah went further.

00:24:55.143 --> 00:24:58.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that Jerusalem would be rebuilt.

00:24:58.847 --> 00:25:02.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will rebuild the ancient ruins;

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:05.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they will raise up
the desolated places of the past,

00:25:05.654 --> 00:25:09.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will restore the devastated cities.”

00:25:09.824 --> 00:25:13.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And true worship would also be restored.

00:25:13.361 --> 00:25:16.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that was quite a level of knowledge.

00:25:16.464 --> 00:25:18.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there’s more.

00:25:18.466 --> 00:25:20.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah went further.

00:25:20.502 --> 00:25:22.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah also indicated

00:25:22.604 --> 00:25:26.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the spiritual revival wouldn’t last.

00:25:26.508 --> 00:25:28.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that is remarkable.

00:25:28.743 --> 00:25:31.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s implied by what we read
in the second part

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Daniel 9:26.

00:25:34.749 --> 00:25:36.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like you to have a look at this.

00:25:36.851 --> 00:25:39.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to be reading

00:25:39.754 --> 00:25:42.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
two parts of this verse,

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:44.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s quite interesting

00:25:44.092 --> 00:25:47.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Daniel 9:26.

00:25:49.664 --> 00:25:52.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, what’s our objective here?

00:25:52.467 --> 00:25:56.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s to see that Jerusalem and its temple

00:25:56.238 --> 00:26:00.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be destroyed a second time

00:26:00.508 --> 00:26:02.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that true worship would not last.

00:26:02.677 --> 00:26:06.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says in the second part of verse 26:

00:26:06.481 --> 00:26:11.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And the people of a leader who is coming

00:26:11.253 --> 00:26:15.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will destroy the city and the holy place.”

00:26:15.991 --> 00:26:18.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when these words were written,

00:26:18.593 --> 00:26:22.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jerusalem and the temple
were already in ruins.

00:26:22.097 --> 00:26:24.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah doesn’t say,

00:26:24.199 --> 00:26:27.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Nebuchadnezzar has destroyed
the city and its temple.’

00:26:27.769 --> 00:26:31.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says:
“The people of a leader who is coming.”

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:35.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Roman general Titus in 70 C.E.

00:26:35.477 --> 00:26:38.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will destroy the city and the holy place.”

00:26:38.346 --> 00:26:40.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In order for that prophecy to be fulfilled,

00:26:40.615 --> 00:26:44.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jerusalem and the temple
would have to be rebuilt

00:26:44.719 --> 00:26:48.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then destroyed a second time.

00:26:48.356 --> 00:26:53.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that is quite a level of knowledge
—quite a level of information.

00:26:53.161 --> 00:26:55.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what would make this necessary?

00:26:55.897 --> 00:27:00.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why, when the Jews
came back to the Promised Land

00:27:00.902 --> 00:27:04.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were intent
on restoring true worship,

00:27:04.372 --> 00:27:06.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why would this fail?

00:27:06.341 --> 00:27:10.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And why would Jerusalem and the temple
be destroyed a second time?

00:27:10.278 --> 00:27:15.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Part of it is due to what we find
in the first part of verse 26:

00:27:16.418 --> 00:27:19.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Messiah will be cut off.”

00:27:20.889 --> 00:27:25.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah foretold, foresaw,

00:27:25.427 --> 00:27:27.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that when the Messiah came,

00:27:27.696 --> 00:27:30.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Jews would reject him.

00:27:30.765 --> 00:27:32.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He would be cut off.

00:27:32.834 --> 00:27:35.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because of that, partly because of that,

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:38.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jerusalem and the temple would be destroyed,

00:27:38.907 --> 00:27:41.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it happens, in 70 C.E.

00:27:41.976 --> 00:27:44.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.

00:27:44.779 --> 00:27:46.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s think about that a minute.

00:27:46.981 --> 00:27:51.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Messiah comes first
and Jerusalem and the temple

00:27:51.353 --> 00:27:54.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are destroyed after that in 70 C.E.

00:27:54.889 --> 00:27:56.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that mean?

00:27:56.958 --> 00:28:01.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means that the Messiah
comes before 70 C.E.

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:04.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we might ask our Jewish friends,

00:28:04.132 --> 00:28:07.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why are you still waiting for the Messiah?

00:28:07.369 --> 00:28:11.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
70 C.E. has come and gone.

00:28:11.539 --> 00:28:16.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Messiah came,
and he too proved to be a true prophet.

00:28:16.544 --> 00:28:20.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And a remarkable prophecy of Jesus
is found in the Sermon on the Mount.

00:28:20.582 --> 00:28:25.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s have a look at it and consider
the implications of this prophecy.

00:28:25.587 --> 00:28:27.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Matthew chapter 7,

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll read verses 22 and 23,

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:37.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an amazing prophecy.

00:28:37.832 --> 00:28:41.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, imagine: At this point, Jesus’ teachings

00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:43.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have not spread beyond Israel.

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:48.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But notice verses 22 and 23:

00:28:48.276 --> 00:28:51.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Many will say to me on that day:

00:28:51.279 --> 00:28:55.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Lord, Lord,
did we not prophesy in your name,

00:28:55.016 --> 00:28:57.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and expel demons in your name,

00:28:57.152 --> 00:29:00.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and perform many powerful works
in your name?’

00:29:00.121 --> 00:29:03.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And then I will declare to them:
‘I never knew you!

00:29:03.958 --> 00:29:08.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Get away from me,
you workers of lawlessness!’”

00:29:08.329 --> 00:29:09.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, isn’t that amazing?

00:29:09.998 --> 00:29:11.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Jesus had simply predicted

00:29:11.866 --> 00:29:13.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his teachings would spread
throughout the earth,

00:29:13.935 --> 00:29:16.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might say, “Well, there’s
nothing remarkable about that.”

00:29:16.604 --> 00:29:18.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jesus is saying something different.

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:20.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus is foretelling

00:29:20.775 --> 00:29:25.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a great apostasy from his teachings.

00:29:25.146 --> 00:29:28.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus is foretelling the birth of Christendom

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:33.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
300 years before the event.

00:29:33.021 --> 00:29:37.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jesus foresees that many

00:29:37.025 --> 00:29:40.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are going to turn away from the truth.

00:29:40.161 --> 00:29:42.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And by the end of the first century,

00:29:42.096 --> 00:29:45.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that apostasy was already at work, wasn’t it?

00:29:45.133 --> 00:29:47.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were sects

00:29:47.068 --> 00:29:51.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the sect of Nicolaus,
for example, and other sects.

00:29:51.439 --> 00:29:55.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now they’re on the cusp
of the great darkness,

00:29:55.810 --> 00:30:00.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the great apostasy, that’s going to set in
from the second century on.

00:30:00.114 --> 00:30:03.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with this in mind, what does Jehovah do?

00:30:03.852 --> 00:30:07.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He makes an amazing statement

00:30:07.822 --> 00:30:10.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Revelation 14—

00:30:10.625 --> 00:30:15.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘144,00 will be on Mount Zion with the Lamb.’

00:30:15.597 --> 00:30:20.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were nowhere near 144,000
in the truth in the first century.

00:30:20.168 --> 00:30:25.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here Jehovah is saying
there are going to be 144,000 in heaven

00:30:25.039 --> 00:30:27.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Lamb at the end.

00:30:27.208 --> 00:30:29.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But not only that, he goes further.

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:32.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s going to be
a ‘great crowd that no man can number.’

00:30:32.814 --> 00:30:35.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could that ever come true?

00:30:35.183 --> 00:30:38.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ours is the God of true prophecy.

00:30:38.987 --> 00:30:41.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s prophecy.

00:30:41.422 --> 00:30:43.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about the second point?

00:30:43.658 --> 00:30:47.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is that no one
can prevent prophecy from being fulfilled.

00:30:47.662 --> 00:30:50.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Devil would love
to prevent that from taking place.

00:30:50.765 --> 00:30:52.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about Revelation 14.

00:30:52.867 --> 00:30:55.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the Devil could make the number

00:30:55.603 --> 00:30:58.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one short of 144,000,

00:30:58.373 --> 00:31:01.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’d be happy because he would show

00:31:01.175 --> 00:31:05.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah was inaccurate
in what he foretold.

00:31:05.079 --> 00:31:07.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so that’s one
of the reasons why the Devil

00:31:07.115 --> 00:31:11.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has made war on the remnant
of the seed of the woman,

00:31:11.819 --> 00:31:14.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if at all possible, to prevent that number

00:31:14.822 --> 00:31:18.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 144,000 from coming to pass.

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:21.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, of course, he’s going to fail.

00:31:21.529 --> 00:31:24.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about the prophecy in the Bible

00:31:24.065 --> 00:31:29.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that America and Britain
would become a dual world power?

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:31.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Britain wouldn’t become a world power

00:31:31.539 --> 00:31:33.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at all if France
had anything to say about it.

00:31:33.875 --> 00:31:36.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
France and Britain were sworn enemies.

00:31:36.945 --> 00:31:39.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for many, many, years,

00:31:39.113 --> 00:31:42.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
France was much richer
and much more powerful

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:45.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than Britain was.

00:31:45.153 --> 00:31:49.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally,
at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815,

00:31:49.023 --> 00:31:51.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
France had one last chance

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:55.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prevent Britain
from becoming a world power.

00:31:55.229 --> 00:31:57.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And France should have won that battle.

00:31:57.832 --> 00:32:01.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything was stacked against the British.

00:32:01.235 --> 00:32:03.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there was a driving rain,

00:32:03.938 --> 00:32:07.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a fatal miscalculation
on the part of Napoleon,

00:32:07.842 --> 00:32:11.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a few other factors
that foiled their attempt.

00:32:11.379 --> 00:32:13.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Britain did become a world power.

00:32:13.615 --> 00:32:16.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at the end of the 19th century,

00:32:16.184 --> 00:32:20.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s quite true that the sun
never set on the British Empire.

00:32:21.856 --> 00:32:26.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, America and Britain
were supposed to become a dual world power,

00:32:26.294 --> 00:32:30.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Britain wasn’t the least bit interested
in sharing its power with America.

00:32:30.965 --> 00:32:35.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It tried to prevent America
from separating as a colony.

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:38.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a long war,

00:32:38.606 --> 00:32:41.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there were mistakes made on both sides.

00:32:41.275 --> 00:32:44.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But finally, America gained
its independence from Britain.

00:32:44.912 --> 00:32:46.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what do we find?

00:32:46.314 --> 00:32:48.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some years after that,

00:32:48.316 --> 00:32:52.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Britain is sharing its power with America.

00:32:52.253 --> 00:32:55.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are a dual world power.

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:59.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fighters against God will never prevail.

00:32:59.627 --> 00:33:03.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We serve “the God of true prophecy.”

00:33:03.297 --> 00:33:07.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And “what he foretells comes to be.”

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:11.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we’ve discussed,

00:33:11.572 --> 00:33:15.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each detail of the prophecy
recorded at Daniel chapter 11

00:33:15.943 --> 00:33:18.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has come true so far.

00:33:18.312 --> 00:33:20.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must have confidence

00:33:20.481 --> 00:33:23.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the remaining events
described in that prophecy

00:33:23.751 --> 00:33:25.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will also come true.

00:33:25.853 --> 00:33:30.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are living in the last days
of the time of the end.

00:33:30.458 --> 00:33:34.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon, the nations will fulfill the prophecy

00:33:34.295 --> 00:33:37.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Thessalonians 5:3:

00:33:37.165 --> 00:33:40.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whenever it is that they are saying,

00:33:40.902 --> 00:33:42.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Peace and security!’

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:47.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“then sudden destruction
is to be instantly on them,

00:33:47.275 --> 00:33:50.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“just like birth pains on a pregnant woman,

00:33:50.778 --> 00:33:54.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will by no means escape.”

00:33:54.749 --> 00:33:56.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then “sudden destruction”

00:33:56.984 --> 00:34:00.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comes upon all parts of Satan’s system.

00:34:00.655 --> 00:34:03.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you can see on the screen,

00:34:03.057 --> 00:34:05.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel 12:1 says:

00:34:05.727 --> 00:34:09.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“During that time Michael will stand up,

00:34:09.297 --> 00:34:13.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the great prince who is standing
in behalf of your people.

00:34:13.367 --> 00:34:18.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And there will occur a time of distress
such as has not occurred

00:34:18.072 --> 00:34:21.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“since there came to be a nation
until that time.

00:34:21.709 --> 00:34:26.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And during that time
your people will escape,

00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:30.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everyone who is found written down
in the book.”

00:34:31.252 --> 00:34:34.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That leads us into our third point:

00:34:34.555 --> 00:34:37.325 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
How should knowing the information

00:34:37.325 --> 00:34:39.060 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we have just discussed

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:42.830 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
affect the decisions that we make?

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:46.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what we have reviewed
is not just interesting history;

00:34:46.801 --> 00:34:49.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s a dramatic prelude

00:34:49.203 --> 00:34:52.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to what will soon happen here on earth.

00:34:52.707 --> 00:34:56.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has given his people this knowledge

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:58.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can act on it.

00:34:58.112 --> 00:35:00.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It should influence the choices we make.

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:04.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:35:04.318 --> 00:35:08.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how one young brother makes decisions

00:35:08.122 --> 00:35:12.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
based on his understanding
of Daniel’s prophecy.

00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:18.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was my best friend, Lucas,

00:35:18.065 --> 00:35:19.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we were kids.

00:35:19.734 --> 00:35:21.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was me, Oscar.

00:35:22.737 --> 00:35:25.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We knew exactly what we wanted to do

00:35:25.106 --> 00:35:27.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we grew up:

00:35:27.108 --> 00:35:28.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pioneer!

00:35:28.609 --> 00:35:30.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go to Bethel!

00:35:30.077 --> 00:35:31.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Build Kingdom Halls!

00:35:32.547 --> 00:35:34.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We kept those goals.

00:35:34.582 --> 00:35:36.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when graduation came,

00:35:36.617 --> 00:35:39.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were ready.

00:35:44.559 --> 00:35:48.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our little business needed
just a few more accounts.

00:35:48.229 --> 00:35:51.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we’d have enough for us
and to help our families.

00:35:54.202 --> 00:35:55.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally!

00:35:55.236 --> 00:35:58.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Day one of the service year

00:35:59.707 --> 00:36:02.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and two new pioneers!

00:36:04.545 --> 00:36:06.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where we live, . . .

00:36:06.747 --> 00:36:08.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please don’t call me ever again!

00:36:09.817 --> 00:36:12.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . finding spiritual interest is tough.

00:36:25.566 --> 00:36:27.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We already have cleaners.
Thanks.

00:36:27.235 --> 00:36:30.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finding enough work
was harder than we thought.

00:36:31.806 --> 00:36:34.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A few months in,
I was sure

00:36:34.008 --> 00:36:36.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah would help
if we just stuck it out.

00:36:37.945 --> 00:36:40.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sorry, Oscar.
Can’t make it today.

00:36:40.314 --> 00:36:43.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Something came up.
Lucas.

00:36:45.119 --> 00:36:48.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What came up
was an opportunity for more money,

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:52.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but at what cost?

00:36:55.496 --> 00:36:57.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you quitting, or what?

00:36:58.165 --> 00:37:01.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I’m not quitting.

00:37:01.669 --> 00:37:03.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pioneering or our business?

00:37:05.039 --> 00:37:07.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neither, but you know the struggle here.

00:37:07.808 --> 00:37:11.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most brothers can afford
to pioneer for a year, two tops.

00:37:11.445 --> 00:37:14.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look, it’s not full-time while I’m training.

00:37:14.515 --> 00:37:17.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a backup plan.

00:37:51.052 --> 00:37:53.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Lucas stopped pioneering?

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe he’s right.

00:38:04.031 --> 00:38:06.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s just being practical.

00:38:09.103 --> 00:38:13.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, is it wrong to quit
if you think it’s not working?

00:38:15.443 --> 00:38:18.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I struggled with the same question
when I pioneered.

00:38:20.614 --> 00:38:23.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever you decide,

00:38:23.417 --> 00:38:25.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you can tell Jehovah your reason

00:38:25.953 --> 00:38:28.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a clean conscience,

00:38:28.289 --> 00:38:30.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then it’s the right decision for you.

00:38:32.026 --> 00:38:35.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why would I keep going
when it’s so difficult?

00:38:39.767 --> 00:38:42.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Since all these things
are to be dissolved in this way,

00:38:42.603 --> 00:38:45.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“consider what sort of people
you ought to be

00:38:45.072 --> 00:38:48.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in holy acts of conduct
and deeds of godly devotion.”

00:39:05.593 --> 00:39:07.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really is “the last days,”

00:39:07.828 --> 00:39:10.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and people need “the good news.”

00:39:11.599 --> 00:39:13.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they’ll only hear it

00:39:13.601 --> 00:39:17.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we keep up our “deeds of godly devotion”

00:39:17.304 --> 00:39:19.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as best we can.

00:39:22.343 --> 00:39:26.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to endure and only stop pioneering

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:29.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if my circumstances left no other choice.

00:39:30.484 --> 00:39:34.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I prayed to see the blessings.

00:39:41.328 --> 00:39:43.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after a while,

00:39:43.364 --> 00:39:46.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned that a little perseverance,

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:49.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah’s spirit, can be contagious.

00:39:57.211 --> 00:40:00.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do you want to do
when you grow up?

00:40:00.848 --> 00:40:02.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pioneer.

00:40:02.183 --> 00:40:03.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And go to Bethel?

00:40:03.484 --> 00:40:04.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yep!

00:40:04.218 --> 00:40:05.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then maybe build Kingdom Halls.

00:40:05.786 --> 00:40:06.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You in?

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:40:17.031 --> 00:40:19.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That young brother was trying to figure out

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what to do with his life.

00:40:21.602 --> 00:40:25.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He made a good decision
because he allowed Bible prophecy

00:40:25.573 --> 00:40:27.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to influence his thinking.

00:40:27.675 --> 00:40:30.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that teens everywhere

00:40:30.144 --> 00:40:33.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
face many challenges, and we feel for you.

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:36.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, I was once a teenager,

00:40:36.117 --> 00:40:39.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I can’t even imagine
some of the situations

00:40:39.253 --> 00:40:41.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you find yourselves in.

00:40:41.489 --> 00:40:44.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the Governing Body loves you,

00:40:44.058 --> 00:40:46.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we want to help.

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:49.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I’m very happy to announce a new series

00:40:49.396 --> 00:40:52.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“My Teen Life.”

00:40:52.466 --> 00:40:54.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll hear from Witnesses

00:40:54.668 --> 00:40:57.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who share the challenges
they faced in their teens

00:40:57.872 --> 00:41:01.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how they overcame them
with Jehovah’s help.

00:41:01.208 --> 00:41:03.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The interviews are candid;

00:41:03.244 --> 00:41:05.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the issues are real.

00:41:05.246 --> 00:41:07.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s the first episode.

00:41:16.357 --> 00:41:17.925 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, when I was a teenager,

00:41:17.925 --> 00:41:19.527 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t see any benefit

00:41:19.527 --> 00:41:20.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in talking to my parents

00:41:20.928 --> 00:41:23.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they
liked different things than I liked.

00:41:25.566 --> 00:41:27.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I thought, ‘Well, what’s the point?’

00:41:27.635 --> 00:41:31.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I also wanted to be an adult.

00:41:31.071 --> 00:41:33.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to feel like an adult
and be treated like an adult.

00:41:33.707 --> 00:41:36.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember when my mom
used to pick me up from school.

00:41:36.577 --> 00:41:38.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She wanted to show personal interest in me,

00:41:38.979 --> 00:41:41.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so she’d ask me:
“Oh, how are your friends doing?

00:41:41.148 --> 00:41:42.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How was school today?

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:43.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have a lot of homework?”

00:41:43.984 --> 00:41:47.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I just thought that she was being nosy.

00:41:47.288 --> 00:41:49.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always had my earphones on.

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:52.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And whenever my parents
were trying to talk to me,

00:41:52.226 --> 00:41:56.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was my chance
to just pop them in and ignore them.

00:41:57.898 --> 00:41:59.099 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The way my parents grew up wasn’t

00:41:59.099 --> 00:42:00.467 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the same way that I grew up.

00:42:00.467 --> 00:42:01.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They grew up in a different country;

00:42:01.969 --> 00:42:04.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they spoke a different language;
they grew up in a different time.

00:42:07.007 --> 00:42:11.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you’re talking to somebody
who doesn’t speak your language natively,

00:42:11.078 --> 00:42:14.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
oftentimes you won’t be able
to explain things from your heart.

00:42:14.114 --> 00:42:15.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I had that challenge.

00:42:15.783 --> 00:42:19.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wasn’t able to talk directly
to my parents heart to heart.

00:42:19.153 --> 00:42:21.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so there was always this frustration

00:42:21.522 --> 00:42:24.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in trying to really convey how I felt.

00:42:24.258 --> 00:42:28.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I felt like I
wasn’t really getting through to my parents.

00:42:28.095 --> 00:42:31.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I went to my first pioneer school,
I learned a lot about Jehovah’s qualities.

00:42:31.699 --> 00:42:35.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one of them was
how he was a very approachable Person.

00:42:35.636 --> 00:42:38.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I thought to myself,
‘Am I an approachable person?’

00:42:40.274 --> 00:42:42.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I thought about how
I acted in the ministry

00:42:42.443 --> 00:42:45.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then at the meetings and then at home.

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:49.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I realized that at home
I had a lot of things I needed to fix.

00:42:49.483 --> 00:42:51.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like it was two different worlds
I was living in.

00:42:51.986 --> 00:42:54.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One was when I was at school with my peers;

00:42:54.955 --> 00:42:57.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like I was understood.

00:42:57.057 --> 00:43:00.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at home,
I kind of just withdrew to myself.

00:43:00.461 --> 00:43:04.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wouldn’t try to communicate with them
because it didn’t seem worth the effort.

00:43:04.164 --> 00:43:06.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to figure out problems in my own way.

00:43:06.233 --> 00:43:08.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was kind of trial and error.

00:43:11.872 --> 00:43:15.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I developed a lot of bad habits

00:43:15.075 --> 00:43:17.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that today I’m still trying to overcome.

00:43:17.845 --> 00:43:20.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I’d been able
to communicate with them more,

00:43:20.748 --> 00:43:23.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if I’d been able to connect
with them and ask for their help

00:43:23.817 --> 00:43:26.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and get their support
and have them on my team,

00:43:26.887 --> 00:43:28.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
things would have gone a lot better.

00:43:28.922 --> 00:43:31.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I really wish I had.

00:43:31.258 --> 00:43:33.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus, who was a perfect human being

00:43:33.694 --> 00:43:37.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who had perfect judgment,
didn’t make decisions on his own.

00:43:37.364 --> 00:43:39.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He always looked to his Father for guidance.

00:43:39.867 --> 00:43:41.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that got me thinking,

00:43:41.268 --> 00:43:42.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, if Jesus did that,

00:43:42.703 --> 00:43:43.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘there has to be something good

00:43:43.771 --> 00:43:45.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in it for me too.’

00:43:45.039 --> 00:43:48.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What really helped me was Colossians 4:6.

00:43:48.242 --> 00:43:51.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew I needed to speak
more graciously in the family.

00:43:52.012 --> 00:43:55.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I realized
that I was speaking very defensively

00:43:55.849 --> 00:43:58.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that I needed
to be more approachable to my parents.

00:43:58.352 --> 00:44:01.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I first tried to talk with them,
of course,

00:44:01.188 --> 00:44:04.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was awkward and I didn’t want to talk
about anything personal

00:44:04.391 --> 00:44:06.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I wasn’t used to it.

00:44:06.627 --> 00:44:09.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I thought I could maybe
ask them about themselves

00:44:09.797 --> 00:44:13.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—ask them how their day was
or what they liked from the meetings.

00:44:13.434 --> 00:44:15.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I just tried to show more interest in them

00:44:15.636 --> 00:44:17.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
instead of focusing on myself.

00:44:17.604 --> 00:44:18.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I think that’s what got

00:44:18.872 --> 00:44:19.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the conversations going 

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:20.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and got me comfortable

00:44:20.941 --> 00:44:22.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to really talk with them.

00:44:22.242 --> 00:44:26.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so focused on how my parents
weren’t understanding me

00:44:26.246 --> 00:44:29.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I wasn’t really trying
to understand them.

00:44:31.318 --> 00:44:33.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I thought about my parents,

00:44:33.454 --> 00:44:36.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought about how much work
it takes to be a parent.

00:44:36.557 --> 00:44:39.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From when I was a baby, for many years,

00:44:39.793 --> 00:44:42.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were working day and night
to try to care for me.

00:44:42.062 --> 00:44:46.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They never demanded a thank you
or anything from me.

00:44:46.066 --> 00:44:48.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were really self-sacrificing.

00:44:48.302 --> 00:44:52.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I imagined:
‘If I had to work that much for somebody,

00:44:52.773 --> 00:44:56.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘how would I feel if they
didn’t really say thank you?

00:44:56.810 --> 00:44:58.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Or how would I feel

00:44:58.579 --> 00:45:00.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘if this person whom I worked so hard for

00:45:00.981 --> 00:45:03.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t really view me as their friend?’

00:45:03.751 --> 00:45:06.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later on, as I got older and started

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:09.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that communication going with my parents,

00:45:09.356 --> 00:45:13.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that taking their advice
and really listening to their opinions

00:45:13.494 --> 00:45:15.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and always letting them know

00:45:15.662 --> 00:45:18.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what I’m going to do
and where I’m going to go

00:45:18.499 --> 00:45:21.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a mature thing to do.

00:45:21.301 --> 00:45:22.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our heart oftentimes

00:45:22.936 --> 00:45:25.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
takes the driver’s seat, and it directs us

00:45:25.806 --> 00:45:27.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to where it thinks it should go.

00:45:27.274 --> 00:45:30.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And oftentimes it goes
in the wrong direction,

00:45:30.611 --> 00:45:33.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we sometimes get hurt.

00:45:33.313 --> 00:45:35.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we look back and say,
“I wish I hadn’t done that.”

00:45:35.983 --> 00:45:37.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our parents have been there.

00:45:37.985 --> 00:45:42.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What they’re trying to do
for us now is to tell us,

00:45:42.456 --> 00:45:44.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Don’t let your heart
take the driver’s seat.”

00:45:44.691 --> 00:45:47.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I could talk to my teenage self,

00:45:47.227 --> 00:45:51.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would tell myself to see
my mom and dad more like coaches, 

00:45:51.498 --> 00:45:54.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I used to think
they were always trying to criticize me

00:45:54.468 --> 00:45:56.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and point out my faults.

00:45:56.837 --> 00:45:59.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, really, they’re just trying to help me,

00:45:59.306 --> 00:46:02.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they want me to have a happy life.

00:46:02.376 --> 00:46:05.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really wish I knew that as a teenager.

00:46:05.012 --> 00:46:07.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I’m glad I learned that now.

00:46:27.334 --> 00:46:29.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hope that you’ll enjoy and benefit

00:46:29.803 --> 00:46:32.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from future episodes of “My Teen Life.”

This new series is another way

00:46:35.476 --> 00:46:38.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body prepares Jehovah’s people

00:46:38.345 --> 00:46:40.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to cope with today’s challenges

00:46:40.914 --> 00:46:44.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to be ready for what’s coming.

00:46:44.318 --> 00:46:48.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bible prophecy shows that in the near future,

00:46:48.255 --> 00:46:53.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the nations will turn
on all false religions and wipe them out.

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:57.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, they will launch
a final attack on God’s people.

00:46:57.898 --> 00:47:01.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a mistake that will be!

00:47:01.101 --> 00:47:04.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As discussed in the <i>Pure Worship</i> book,

00:47:04.438 --> 00:47:07.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will respond to that attack

00:47:07.307 --> 00:47:10.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by unleashing his rage on the nations.

00:47:10.911 --> 00:47:13.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the dust of Armageddon settles,

00:47:13.714 --> 00:47:16.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those with the earthly hope can look forward

00:47:16.216 --> 00:47:20.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a thousand years
of genuine peace and security,

00:47:20.687 --> 00:47:24.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
working under the rule of God’s Kingdom.

00:47:24.191 --> 00:47:26.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before that time comes,

00:47:26.693 --> 00:47:30.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will continue to face
trials and opposition,

00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:32.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we can endure.

00:47:32.099 --> 00:47:34.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have many modern-day examples

00:47:34.735 --> 00:47:37.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can imitate right now.

00:47:37.204 --> 00:47:39.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those examples can help all of us

00:47:39.773 --> 00:47:42.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be prepared, to stand firm,

00:47:42.943 --> 00:47:46.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to remain fully united in the faith.

This month’s original song

00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:52.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
entitled “One United People”

00:47:52.386 --> 00:47:55.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
encourages us to do just that.

We watch the storm clouds gather.
We’ve seen the signs before.

The wind of persecution
Is no stranger to our door.

00:48:43.704 --> 00:48:56.850 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We will face each test with courage,
With Jehovah standing near.

00:48:56.850 --> 00:49:09.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And ‘no weapon formed against us’

The God of our salvation
Whose love will never die.

00:50:23.937 --> 00:50:37.050 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He will never leave his people,
And his spirit makes us strong.

Unafraid we face the crowd.

And these hearts that beat within us

The stirring theme of this year’s convention

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:30.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is “Powerful By Faith!”

00:52:30.497 --> 00:52:32.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will learn what faith is,

00:52:32.899 --> 00:52:34.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why it is essential,

00:52:34.935 --> 00:52:37.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how we can acquire it.

00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:39.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here is a preview.

00:52:41.508 --> 00:52:45.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can be hard to put faith
in something you cannot see.

00:52:46.913 --> 00:52:49.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But real faith is not blind.

00:52:51.418 --> 00:52:53.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Real faith is based on facts,

00:52:54.554 --> 00:52:56.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on realities,

00:52:58.525 --> 00:53:00.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on truth.

00:53:02.729 --> 00:53:04.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It gives us courage and strength,

00:53:07.434 --> 00:53:09.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it helps us to endure.

00:53:11.938 --> 00:53:15.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When life gets hard, it provides peace.

00:53:15.508 --> 00:53:19.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reminds us of our purpose,

00:53:19.145 --> 00:53:21.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it brings us real joy.

00:53:24.684 --> 00:53:26.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

which comes to us

00:53:51.411 --> 00:53:55.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from our brothers and sisters in Belarus.

00:53:57.017 --> 00:54:01.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Belarus is an Eastern European nation
that borders Russia.

00:54:02.222 --> 00:54:04.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s known as

00:54:04.224 --> 00:54:08.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the “blue-eyed” country
because it is dotted

00:54:08.228 --> 00:54:11.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with more than 10,000 lakes.

00:54:11.364 --> 00:54:16.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

from the 16th century, are popular sites.

This is Nesvizh Castle.

00:54:31.985 --> 00:54:36.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you look up at the ceiling of its chapel,
you’ll see Jehovah’s name

00:54:36.323 --> 00:54:40.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the form of the Tetragrammaton.

00:54:40.093 --> 00:54:44.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Belarus was part of the Soviet Union,

00:54:44.097 --> 00:54:48.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses
faced strong government opposition.

00:54:49.569 --> 00:54:54.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of our brothers
were exiled to far-away Siberia.

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:58.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, more than 6,000 publishers

in Belarus.

00:55:05.085 --> 00:55:07.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is a zealous pioneer spirit here.

00:55:07.821 --> 00:55:11.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Twenty percent of the publishers

00:55:11.358 --> 00:55:13.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are in full-time service.

00:55:14.494 --> 00:55:17.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is how our brothers share the good news

in the city of Brest.

00:55:18.698 --> 00:55:21.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They enjoy many aspects

00:55:21.001 --> 00:55:23.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of public witnessing.

00:55:23.536 --> 00:55:28.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are our brothers and sisters
in the city of Kobryn.

in the house of the great King Nebuchadnezzar.

00:56:42.749 --> 00:56:44.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait!

00:56:44.684 --> 00:56:46.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:56:49.122 --> 00:56:50.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be strong, my son.

00:56:53.393 --> 00:56:55.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a new land with new laws.

00:56:55.728 --> 00:56:57.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon they’ll want us to worship their gods.

00:56:58.598 --> 00:56:59.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is in Israel.

00:57:01.067 --> 00:57:02.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re in Babylon now.

00:57:08.074 --> 00:57:10.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s going to happen to us?

00:57:12.345 --> 00:57:13.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had a dream,

00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:14.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and no one can tell him what it is.

00:57:14.914 --> 00:57:17.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone is to be executed by dawn.

00:57:17.617 --> 00:57:19.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have until morning.

00:57:19.719 --> 00:57:21.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To do what?

00:57:21.654 --> 00:57:22.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Jerusalem.

00:57:24.624 --> 00:57:26.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They burned down Jehovah’s house!

00:57:27.927 --> 00:57:30.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As long as Jehovah exists,

00:57:30.163 --> 00:57:32.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have hope.

00:57:32.765 --> 00:57:35.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interpretations belong to my God, Jehovah.

00:57:35.401 --> 00:57:38.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows your dream and what it means.

00:57:38.972 --> 00:57:41.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where is your God?

00:57:42.475 --> 00:57:43.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Kill them!

00:57:43.977 --> 00:57:45.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O Jehovah,

00:57:45.578 --> 00:57:48.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
surely you didn’t bring us here to die.

00:57:48.982 --> 00:57:51.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, vindicate yourself.

00:58:01.294 --> 00:58:04.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we’ve discussed in our program,

00:58:04.097 --> 00:58:08.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel played an important role
as Jehovah’s prophet.

00:58:08.134 --> 00:58:11.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we’ll see in our video drama,

00:58:11.237 --> 00:58:14.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s much we can learn
from his life and example.

00:58:15.642 --> 00:58:18.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now, before we sign off,

in Russia in your prayers.

Learn from their example
of faith and courage.

See these events for what they are

—the fulfillment of Bible prophecy.

01:02:54.787 --> 01:02:59.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let this knowledge
move you to make wise decisions.
