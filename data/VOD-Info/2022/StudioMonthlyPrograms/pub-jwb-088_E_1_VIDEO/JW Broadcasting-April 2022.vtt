00:00:01.418 --> 00:00:03.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome!

00:00:03.086 --> 00:00:06.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is my friend, Alex Reinmueller.

00:00:06.556 --> 00:00:09.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
Alex is going to help me host our program,

00:00:09.693 --> 00:00:13.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
which focuses on family.

00:00:13.196 --> 00:00:16.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
Alex, what do we have to look forward to?

00:00:16.132 --> 00:00:19.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Gerrit.
I’m delighted to be here with you.

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
For nearly a decade,

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:24.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
children have enjoyed our animated series

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Become Jehovah’s Friend.</i>

00:00:26.576 --> 00:00:29.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
How have they and their parents benefited?

00:00:29.345 --> 00:00:32.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
As teens, Tainara and Alex developed

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
a strong identity as servants of Jehovah.

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:39.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll learn how this helped them
resist temptations.

00:00:39.322 --> 00:00:42.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you married or contemplating marriage?

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:46.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll enjoy a new series
we’re introducing in our program.

00:00:46.396 --> 00:00:48.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s designed to help Christian couples

00:00:48.431 --> 00:00:51.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
achieve a happy marriage.

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:53.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m eager to get started.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is JW Broadcasting® for April 2022.

00:01:17.393 --> 00:01:19.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, we will talk about those

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:23.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are close to all of our hearts

00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:25.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
—our children.

00:01:25.568 --> 00:01:27.904 line:10% position:50% align:center
I am sure that you dear parents

00:01:27.904 --> 00:01:31.141 line:10% position:50% align:center
greatly love and appreciate your children.

00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:34.244 line:10% position:50% align:center
What a privilege it is to have them!

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:38.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about it: There are millions of angels.

00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:43.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, angels were not given
the privilege to produce children.

00:01:44.654 --> 00:01:47.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jesus was on earth, he was not married,

00:01:47.957 --> 00:01:51.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
so he did not have the privilege
of having children.

00:01:51.828 --> 00:01:54.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you parents have that privilege.

00:01:54.731 --> 00:01:56.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a treasure!

00:01:58.101 --> 00:02:01.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does the Governing Body
want to tell you children?

00:02:01.905 --> 00:02:04.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
That we love you!

00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:07.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are so happy to have you with us,

00:02:07.977 --> 00:02:11.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we would like to help you
to become and remain

00:02:11.815 --> 00:02:14.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
worshippers of Jehovah.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are like a beautiful gift,

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
a special gift, from Jehovah.

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:22.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christian parents value and appreciate
you children

00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:25.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than a million dollars!

00:02:25.628 --> 00:02:27.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we know?

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because Psalm 127:3 says

00:02:32.602 --> 00:02:37.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “[children] are
an inheritance from Jehovah.”

00:02:37.607 --> 00:02:39.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:02:40.443 --> 00:02:43.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
An inheritance is a very valuable gift

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:46.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
that has been given to someone.

00:02:46.015 --> 00:02:49.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
Often, the gift is
from an older family relative.

00:02:50.653 --> 00:02:55.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah views you children
as a very valuable gift

00:02:55.491 --> 00:02:58.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he has given to your parents.

00:02:58.228 --> 00:03:01.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
He expects parents
to take good care of this gift.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
He entrusts parents with the welfare
and happiness of their children.

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when parents do their best for you,

00:03:14.077 --> 00:03:17.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
it especially makes us happy
when you children

00:03:17.914 --> 00:03:21.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
do your best to please and serve Jehovah.

00:03:22.252 --> 00:03:24.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are so many children earth wide

00:03:24.954 --> 00:03:27.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are fine examples for others

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of their love
for Jehovah and the truth.

00:03:32.996 --> 00:03:36.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
Parents, will your children
become good examples

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:38.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
for other young ones in the truth?

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:44.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
One father of seven children,
all of whom grew up as lovers of Jehovah,

00:03:44.841 --> 00:03:46.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
would always tell new parents

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there are no guarantees with children.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
They each have their own personality

00:03:52.882 --> 00:03:57.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
and are exposed
to various outside influences.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he would always urge new parents
to do the best they can

00:04:01.124 --> 00:04:04.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
to teach their children
and reach their hearts.

00:04:05.361 --> 00:04:08.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your conscientious effort
increases the possibility

00:04:08.631 --> 00:04:12.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
of them becoming
a success in Jehovah’s service.

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:16.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
So parents, how are you caring

00:04:16.306 --> 00:04:18.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
for your “inheritance”?

00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:21.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are some vital steps

00:04:21.444 --> 00:04:24.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
to teach and reach the heart of your child?

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:28.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, please locate

00:04:28.318 --> 00:04:31.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
Judges 13:8.

00:04:33.056 --> 00:04:36.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
The parents of Samson likely prayed often

00:04:36.993 --> 00:04:40.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jehovah’s help
to properly raise their son.

00:04:41.898 --> 00:04:43.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 8 says:

00:04:44.767 --> 00:04:49.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Manoah pleaded with Jehovah and said:
‘Pardon me, Jehovah.

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:53.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Please let the man of the true God
whom you just sent

00:04:53.343 --> 00:04:56.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘come again to instruct us

00:04:56.079 --> 00:05:00.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what we should do
with the child who will be born.’”

00:05:01.284 --> 00:05:03.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you parents do the same,

00:05:03.453 --> 00:05:08.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will answer your prayers
through the Scriptures, Bible literature,

00:05:08.191 --> 00:05:11.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
or possibly by means
of a congregation meeting.

00:05:12.095 --> 00:05:15.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, being consistent
with family worship

00:05:15.598 --> 00:05:20.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
is vital to reach the heart of one’s child.

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:22.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is true that it takes some planning

00:05:22.972 --> 00:05:26.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
and absorbs some of your time each week.

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:29.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
But remember that in 2008,

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:31.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body gave us all

00:05:31.547 --> 00:05:35.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
the extra time each week for family worship

00:05:35.451 --> 00:05:38.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
by adjusting the weekly meeting schedule.

00:05:39.822 --> 00:05:41.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
A brother from Portugal wrote:

00:05:41.858 --> 00:05:44.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Aside from family worship,

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
“my father had a separate Bible study
on a different day

00:05:47.563 --> 00:05:50.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with each of us three children.

00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:53.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am sure that these studies
were very important

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:57.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us to resist
all of the pressures at school.”

00:05:58.508 --> 00:06:01.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is no surprise that all three children

00:06:01.044 --> 00:06:05.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been in special full-time service
for a number of years now.

00:06:07.183 --> 00:06:10.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
Similarly, a brother
from northern Italy wrote:

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We studied with each one of our children
personally

00:06:14.891 --> 00:06:18.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
in harmony with their age and gender.”

00:06:18.995 --> 00:06:23.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each family head must decide
what is best for his family.

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:27.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, a well-prepared
Family Worship program

00:06:27.036 --> 00:06:29.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
is essential.

00:06:30.506 --> 00:06:34.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another excellent way to teach your children
is by example.

00:06:35.878 --> 00:06:38.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
Children often pick up mannerisms

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:40.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
from their parents.

00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:42.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
They often walk and talk

00:06:42.051 --> 00:06:44.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
like one of the parents.

00:06:44.053 --> 00:06:48.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they also pick up
on godly personality traits and attitudes.

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:54.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
So be the kind of person
that you want your child to be.

00:06:54.997 --> 00:06:59.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though Jesus was the only perfect child
ever born on earth,

00:06:59.335 --> 00:07:03.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
it appears that his mother, Mary,
and adoptive father, Joseph,

00:07:03.806 --> 00:07:06.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
were good examples for him.

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:10.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke 2:41, 42

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:14.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
tells us that Jesus’ parents
“were accustomed to go from year to year

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jerusalem for . . . the Passover.”

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:20.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joseph could have viewed the trip

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:24.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
as inconvenient and even too expensive.

00:07:24.327 --> 00:07:28.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as parents, he and Mary
set a good example

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the young boy Jesus.

00:07:31.801 --> 00:07:36.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most young ones can quote
1 Corinthians 15:33 by heart.

00:07:37.473 --> 00:07:40.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe it is because their parents
have reminded them

00:07:40.376 --> 00:07:43.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the principle so often.

00:07:43.412 --> 00:07:48.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Bad associations spoil useful habits.”

00:07:49.752 --> 00:07:53.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember in Luke chapter 8
that Jesus spoke

00:07:53.623 --> 00:07:55.458 line:10% position:50% align:center
about the different kinds of soil

00:07:55.458 --> 00:07:59.128 line:10% position:50% align:center
that “the word of God” might fall on?

00:07:59.128 --> 00:08:02.465 line:10% position:50% align:center
The “soil” represents your child’s heart.

00:08:02.999 --> 00:08:06.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is our hope and prayer
that your child’s heart

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:10.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
is like “good,” or “fine,” soil.

00:08:12.208 --> 00:08:14.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 15,

00:08:14.343 --> 00:08:18.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus applied the illustration
of the fine soil,

00:08:18.181 --> 00:08:19.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
saying:

00:08:19.549 --> 00:08:22.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
“These are the ones who,

00:08:22.118 --> 00:08:25.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
“after hearing the word
with a fine and good heart,

00:08:25.188 --> 00:08:28.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
retain it and bear fruit with endurance.”

00:08:29.892 --> 00:08:34.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what can happen if after responding
to your training from God’s Word,

00:08:34.197 --> 00:08:38.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
your child is somehow exposed
to bad association?

00:08:39.235 --> 00:08:43.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
When young ones spend considerable time
with other young ones

00:08:43.372 --> 00:08:46.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have not been trained
by Bible principles,

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:50.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can counteract
your training from God’s Word.

00:08:50.813 --> 00:08:54.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such association is like a severe rainstorm

00:08:54.684 --> 00:08:59.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
that erodes the fine soil
that you have built up.

00:08:59.355 --> 00:09:03.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can quickly wash away
the good training that you have given.

00:09:04.327 --> 00:09:08.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 1:1 says that we can be happy

00:09:08.231 --> 00:09:12.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we do not “walk” with, “stand” with,

00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:16.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “sit” with those who do what is bad.

00:09:16.305 --> 00:09:18.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we could add to that

00:09:18.341 --> 00:09:22.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and do not text or email others

00:09:22.178 --> 00:09:25.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
who do not think wholesome thoughts.

00:09:25.014 --> 00:09:29.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help your children to choose good associates.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
So many young ones around the world

00:09:33.055 --> 00:09:36.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
have responded
to their parents’ fine instruction

00:09:36.626 --> 00:09:40.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
and express themselves from the heart.

00:09:40.029 --> 00:09:44.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me share a few experiences
that demonstrate this.

00:09:45.201 --> 00:09:50.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
One young person from the United States
wrote in saying:

00:09:50.139 --> 00:09:52.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am 11 years old,

00:09:52.775 --> 00:09:55.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I am an unbaptized publisher.

00:09:55.311 --> 00:09:58.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I can’t thank you enough
for all that you do!

00:09:58.814 --> 00:10:02.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I especially appreciate
all the time and effort you put

00:10:02.718 --> 00:10:06.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
“into the Caleb and Sophia videos.

00:10:06.522 --> 00:10:08.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I love these videos.

00:10:08.524 --> 00:10:12.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They help me to show good conduct at school.

00:10:12.595 --> 00:10:16.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am grateful that you encourage
family worship.

00:10:16.599 --> 00:10:20.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You see, I used to have
doubts about Jehovah.

00:10:20.169 --> 00:10:23.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If it were not for the time
at family worship,

00:10:23.639 --> 00:10:27.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I probably would have drifted more and more.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:31.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I love Jehovah and want to serve him,

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but I still have lots to work on.

00:10:34.784 --> 00:10:39.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I hope you will make more videos
to help me and other young ones

00:10:39.188 --> 00:10:43.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
to serve Jehovah with our whole heart
and whole soul.”

00:10:45.761 --> 00:10:47.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
We received this message:

00:10:47.963 --> 00:10:51.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Hi, I am ten years old.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I just wanted to say thank you!

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When I grow up, I want to work in Bethel

00:10:56.972 --> 00:11:01.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because I love Jehovah
and want to make him happy.

00:11:01.243 --> 00:11:05.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In Paradise, I want to open a zoo
without cages.

00:11:05.514 --> 00:11:07.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sending all my love!”

00:11:08.584 --> 00:11:13.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
I recall I once met an eight-year-old girl
in Denver, Colorado,

00:11:13.189 --> 00:11:16.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was baptized at eight years of age.

00:11:16.492 --> 00:11:21.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
By that time, she had read
the entire Bible through twice.

00:11:22.131 --> 00:11:25.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, each child is unique;

00:11:25.201 --> 00:11:28.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
not all children become mature
at the same rate

00:11:28.037 --> 00:11:30.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
or at the same point in life.

00:11:30.773 --> 00:11:32.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may recall that we read

00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:36.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 127:3 earlier,

00:11:36.278 --> 00:11:41.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
which said that “[children] are
an inheritance from Jehovah.”

00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:45.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read the next verse, number 4:

00:11:45.454 --> 00:11:48.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Like arrows in the hand of a mighty man,

00:11:48.858 --> 00:11:51.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
so are the sons of one’s youth.”

00:11:52.695 --> 00:11:55.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
Children are likened to “arrows”

00:11:55.164 --> 00:11:58.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
that should be aimed at a target.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
An archer cannot recall an arrow
once it leaves his bow.

00:12:02.772 --> 00:12:04.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
Parents have “arrows.”

00:12:04.907 --> 00:12:08.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have their children to aim at the target

00:12:08.644 --> 00:12:11.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a relatively brief time.

00:12:11.647 --> 00:12:13.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what is the target?

00:12:13.749 --> 00:12:15.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is the goal?

00:12:15.951 --> 00:12:19.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
For your children to become
wholesome, dedicated,

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:22.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
and baptized servants of Jehovah.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, arrows can be made
from different materials,

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:30.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they can vary in size.

00:12:30.232 --> 00:12:32.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
Parents must remember

00:12:32.234 --> 00:12:36.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
that no two children are precisely alike.

00:12:36.405 --> 00:12:38.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some have a good measure

00:12:38.441 --> 00:12:42.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
of mental and emotional maturity
at a young age

00:12:42.478 --> 00:12:46.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
and express a desire to get baptized.

00:12:46.282 --> 00:12:50.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others may not be ready for baptism
until they are a bit older.

00:12:51.854 --> 00:12:53.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus, discerning parents

00:12:53.956 --> 00:12:57.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
do not pressure their children
to get baptized.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, they assist each child

00:13:00.496 --> 00:13:05.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
in keeping with his or her own growth
and spiritual progress.

00:13:06.368 --> 00:13:08.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it is also true that some parents

00:13:08.938 --> 00:13:11.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
underestimate their children.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:16.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some hold them back
from dedicating their life to Jehovah,

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:18.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though they have developed

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
a close relationship with Him as a youngster.

00:13:23.252 --> 00:13:26.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
We received this comment
from a sister in Russia:

00:13:26.822 --> 00:13:31.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Thank you very much
for taking care of younger ones.

00:13:31.627 --> 00:13:34.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I particularly appreciate your support.

00:13:34.897 --> 00:13:37.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your loving words inspire me.

00:13:37.566 --> 00:13:39.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am 17.

00:13:39.602 --> 00:13:42.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am invigorated by articles and videos

00:13:42.738 --> 00:13:44.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
“which are prepared by you.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:49.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your work and love bring me to tears.

00:13:49.144 --> 00:13:52.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Thank you very much!

00:13:52.581 --> 00:13:57.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am touched by your affectionate care
of us here in Russia.

00:13:57.586 --> 00:14:02.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your warm words and prayers
are the best comfort for us.

00:14:02.091 --> 00:14:04.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am grateful to you.

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:06.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Thanks to your taking care of me,

00:14:06.862 --> 00:14:09.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I was able to begin pioneering
two years ago.

00:14:09.899 --> 00:14:12.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It’s the best life ever.

00:14:12.902 --> 00:14:14.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am happy.

00:14:14.904 --> 00:14:16.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I can’t be silent.

00:14:16.906 --> 00:14:19.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m filled with gratitude.”

00:14:19.909 --> 00:14:22.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  once commented:

00:14:22.211 --> 00:14:26.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It has been said that raising children
is a 20-year project,

00:14:26.749 --> 00:14:30.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
but parents never really stop being parents.”

00:14:31.554 --> 00:14:35.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
Among the very best things
you can give to your children

00:14:35.791 --> 00:14:40.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
are love, time, and Bible-based training

00:14:40.396 --> 00:14:44.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
—yes, endeavoring to reach their hearts.

00:14:44.667 --> 00:14:49.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Admittedly, each child
will respond differently to the training.

00:14:50.105 --> 00:14:54.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, many who have been raised
by parents that love Jehovah

00:14:54.476 --> 00:14:58.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
feel like Joanna Mae, a sister in Asia.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:59.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
She says:

00:14:59.648 --> 00:15:03.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Looking back on the training
I received from my parents,

00:15:03.752 --> 00:15:06.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am so thankful that they disciplined me

00:15:06.789 --> 00:15:10.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and taught me to love Jehovah.

00:15:10.059 --> 00:15:12.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They did not just give me life,

00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:15.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
they gave me a meaningful life.”

00:15:16.532 --> 00:15:19.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there are millions of adult Christians

00:15:19.568 --> 00:15:23.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
who would express similar sentiments
of appreciation.

00:15:24.673 --> 00:15:29.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
Parents, take care of your inheritance,
your precious children,

00:15:29.545 --> 00:15:33.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
by training them and reaching their heart.

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:37.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for those encouraging comments,
Gerrit.

00:15:37.553 --> 00:15:41.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
I especially appreciated
all the comments from the young ones.

00:15:42.825 --> 00:15:45.227 line:10% position:50% align:center
One in particular expressed appreciation

00:15:45.227 --> 00:15:47.763 line:10% position:50% align:center
for the Caleb and Sophia videos.

00:15:47.763 --> 00:15:49.298 line:10% position:50% align:center
We’ve grown quite attached

00:15:49.298 --> 00:15:51.433 line:10% position:50% align:center
to these characters, haven’t we?

00:15:51.433 --> 00:15:55.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our next segment, Brother Anthony Morris
of the Governing Body

00:15:55.571 --> 00:16:00.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
discusses how this series
has helped children and their parents.

00:16:13.656 --> 00:16:18.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s hard to believe
that it’s been almost a decade

00:16:18.494 --> 00:16:22.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
since that first release in 2012.

00:16:22.498 --> 00:16:24.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
In that time,

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.902 line:10% position:50% align:center
the <i>Become Jehovah’s Friend </i> series

00:16:26.902 --> 00:16:31.373 line:10% position:50% align:center
has proved to be a real gift from Jehovah.

00:16:32.241 --> 00:16:37.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through these Bible lessons,
children can learn to be kind,

00:16:37.112 --> 00:16:38.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be honest,

00:16:38.947 --> 00:16:40.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be respectful,

00:16:40.849 --> 00:16:43.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to develop other godly qualities

00:16:43.218 --> 00:16:47.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
that help them see and obey

00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:50.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the One who is invisible.”

00:16:50.059 --> 00:16:52.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we begin to understand

00:16:52.194 --> 00:16:54.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
the far-reaching impact

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:58.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
this series has had on Christian families?

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to let Christian parents tell

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:05.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
how these videos have helped their children

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:08.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become Jehovah’s friend.

00:17:10.379 --> 00:17:12.815 line:10% position:50% align:center
Kady-Ann had a really hard time

00:17:12.815 --> 00:17:14.817 line:10% position:50% align:center
working together with the older brothers

00:17:14.817 --> 00:17:16.885 line:10% position:50% align:center
and sisters in the congregation.

00:17:16.885 --> 00:17:20.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a really hard time because

00:17:22.157 --> 00:17:24.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re kind of slow.

00:17:25.994 --> 00:17:30.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
But <i>Lesson 25: Making Friends </i>

00:17:30.099 --> 00:17:32.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
was just what I needed.

00:17:32.735 --> 00:17:35.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
We spent a few weeks discussing the videos

00:17:35.671 --> 00:17:39.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
during our Family Worship evening.

00:17:39.074 --> 00:17:42.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
The videos helped her to be more open-minded

00:17:42.277 --> 00:17:45.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to be more respectful
to the elderly brothers and sisters

00:17:45.748 --> 00:17:48.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
and want to work with them in field service.

00:17:51.019 --> 00:17:53.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sophia liked chatting with Sister Elsa,

00:17:53.088 --> 00:17:56.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though she’s so old.

00:17:56.125 --> 00:17:58.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I can do that too.

00:17:58.594 --> 00:18:01.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
These videos strengthened

00:18:01.296 --> 00:18:03.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
my relationship with Jehovah.

00:18:03.999 --> 00:18:07.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that he hasn’t forgotten me
as a single parent.

00:18:08.804 --> 00:18:12.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can be so hard for single parents

00:18:12.541 --> 00:18:17.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they are trying to take on
the role of both parents.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
I got baptized because I love Jehovah

00:18:21.683 --> 00:18:24.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
with my whole heart.

00:18:24.153 --> 00:18:28.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah still loves me,
even though I’m made from dust,

00:18:28.123 --> 00:18:30.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I’m so little.

00:18:31.493 --> 00:18:34.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
He took some of the weight off my shoulders.

00:18:40.903 --> 00:18:42.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
Laura,

00:18:42.337 --> 00:18:43.839 line:10% position:50% align:center
our middle child,

00:18:43.839 --> 00:18:45.874 line:10% position:50% align:center
was perfectly healthy

00:18:45.874 --> 00:18:48.677 line:10% position:50% align:center
until she turned four years old.

00:18:48.677 --> 00:18:51.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s when she was diagnosed
with a rare tumor

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
in her central nervous system.

00:18:53.649 --> 00:18:57.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, when the treatment was over,
Laura passed away.

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:03.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even while she was sick,

00:19:03.592 --> 00:19:06.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
she just loved watching the videos.

00:19:06.261 --> 00:19:10.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
Her favorite one was <i>Let’s Go in Service.</i>

00:19:10.265 --> 00:19:13.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
This video really made her
want to talk about Jehovah.

00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:15.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the time that she was receiving

00:19:15.737 --> 00:19:19.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
chemotherapy treatments,
which lowered her immunity,

00:19:19.007 --> 00:19:21.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
we couldn’t even leave the house with her.

00:19:24.513 --> 00:19:29.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
But sometimes we’d bring her
to get a checkup or get an exam done,

00:19:29.051 --> 00:19:32.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the doctor would say
that everything was fine for now

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that her immunity was OK.

00:19:33.622 --> 00:19:37.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the very first thing
that she’d say to the doctor was,

00:19:37.025 --> 00:19:39.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So I can go in the ministry, right?”

00:19:39.795 --> 00:19:42.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the doctor would laugh and say,
“Sure you can.”

00:19:42.598 --> 00:19:45.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our family would take advantage
of those times

00:19:45.534 --> 00:19:49.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
to go in field service together as a family
—all together.

00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:52.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
That made Laura so happy.

00:19:55.644 --> 00:19:58.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
It does us good to remember

00:19:58.547 --> 00:20:02.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
why the <i>Become Jehovah’s Friend</i>  series
was created.

00:20:04.086 --> 00:20:09.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
These videos were not designed
as mere entertainment

00:20:09.091 --> 00:20:13.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
to simply pacify children
for a short period of time.

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:17.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
These lessons were designed to help children

00:20:17.666 --> 00:20:21.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
build a relationship with Jehovah

00:20:21.003 --> 00:20:25.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they can live and serve him forever.

00:20:26.408 --> 00:20:29.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loves children.

00:20:29.945 --> 00:20:34.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
That love was evident
in how his Son, Jesus Christ,

00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:36.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
treated children.

00:20:36.585 --> 00:20:41.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body shares that love as well.

00:20:41.456 --> 00:20:42.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also,

00:20:42.791 --> 00:20:46.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loves Christian parents.

00:20:46.695 --> 00:20:49.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sees how hard you work to impress

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:52.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
a love for God deep in your child’s heart.

00:20:54.202 --> 00:20:57.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt you look forward to sharing

00:20:57.005 --> 00:20:59.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
every new video with your child

00:20:59.808 --> 00:21:04.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help him learn
to love and respect Jehovah,

00:21:04.279 --> 00:21:07.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus, and God’s Word.

00:21:07.716 --> 00:21:09.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
But more important,

00:21:09.952 --> 00:21:12.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
how do you think Jehovah feels

00:21:12.854 --> 00:21:16.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing that a young child
can come to know him

00:21:16.658 --> 00:21:18.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
through this animated series

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:23.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
and grow up to become his dedicated servant?

00:21:23.632 --> 00:21:27.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is truly special.

00:21:29.204 --> 00:21:31.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will continue to pray

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:35.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this series reaches the hearts
of our young ones

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:38.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
and draws them closer to Jehovah

00:21:38.313 --> 00:21:41.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
—their Friend now and forever.

00:21:46.655 --> 00:21:49.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we heard, <i>Become Jehovah’s Friend</i>

00:21:49.491 --> 00:21:53.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
is much more
than an enjoyable animated series.

00:21:53.462 --> 00:21:56.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
These videos are powerful teaching tools

00:21:56.164 --> 00:22:00.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
that help young ones develop
a personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:22:00.969 --> 00:22:04.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
Parents, continue to use them wisely

00:22:04.139 --> 00:22:06.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
as part of your family worship.

00:22:07.376 --> 00:22:10.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, at some point in their lives,

00:22:10.245 --> 00:22:13.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
children must make the truth their own.

00:22:13.415 --> 00:22:15.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
What steps can they take

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:19.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
to establish their identity
as servants of Jehovah?

00:22:19.788 --> 00:22:24.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the topic of the next episode
of <i>My Teen Life.</i>

00:22:34.803 --> 00:22:37.539 line:10% position:50% align:center
Me and my mum started attending meetings

00:22:37.539 --> 00:22:40.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
and studying the Bible
when I was five years old.

00:22:40.709 --> 00:22:43.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was 13, I decided to get baptized.

00:22:45.447 --> 00:22:47.082 line:10% position:50% align:center
I decided to dedicate my life

00:22:47.082 --> 00:22:49.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah when I was 14.

00:22:50.485 --> 00:22:53.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
To me, Jehovah is a wonderful God.

00:22:53.355 --> 00:22:57.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s not just a Friend that you can count on 
but also a Father.

00:22:58.593 --> 00:23:01.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t have a spiritual father
here on earth,

00:23:01.329 --> 00:23:03.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I have Jehovah as my Father.

00:23:05.367 --> 00:23:08.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was always something that I had in mind

00:23:08.103 --> 00:23:10.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to let the truth convince me

00:23:10.272 --> 00:23:13.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not serve Jehovah
just because my family does,

00:23:13.375 --> 00:23:16.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
but to serve Jehovah
because of the love I feel for him.

00:23:16.878 --> 00:23:19.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Having that clearly in mind is very important

00:23:19.414 --> 00:23:22.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will make all the difference 
when a problem arises,

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:24.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
or when we have to deal
with something, in the future.

00:23:24.619 --> 00:23:28.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of the truths that convinced me

00:23:28.023 --> 00:23:30.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah was really my God

00:23:30.292 --> 00:23:33.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
were mainly basic truths.

00:23:33.361 --> 00:23:37.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
I believe that they’re like
the foundation of a house.

00:23:37.432 --> 00:23:41.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without a good base, a good foundation,

00:23:41.536 --> 00:23:43.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
a house will not remain standing.

00:23:44.973 --> 00:23:48.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, I wanted to understand better

00:23:48.543 --> 00:23:50.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
from a more scientific standpoint

00:23:50.946 --> 00:23:54.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah really created all things.

00:23:54.282 --> 00:23:57.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I read a lesson
from the brochure <i>Origin of Life.</i>

00:23:57.886 --> 00:24:01.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
From that, I saw how Jehovah
really made everything

00:24:01.323 --> 00:24:05.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a very complex way
and that there was no other explanation.

00:24:07.162 --> 00:24:12.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was doubts like that
that moved me to study the Bible more,

00:24:12.134 --> 00:24:15.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
which helped me to build
a better friendship with Jehovah

00:24:15.737 --> 00:24:19.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to be more convinced
that he was the true God.

00:24:19.307 --> 00:24:22.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
I always enjoyed and made a great effort

00:24:22.177 --> 00:24:25.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
to feed myself
in a spiritual sense in the morning.

00:24:25.347 --> 00:24:26.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was a teenager,

00:24:26.815 --> 00:24:30.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
I went through some problems
that were pretty tough.

00:24:30.352 --> 00:24:32.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt better in the morning.

00:24:32.521 --> 00:24:35.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a time of day when my problems

00:24:35.023 --> 00:24:38.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
didn’t seem so big in my mind.

00:24:38.293 --> 00:24:41.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s very important to have spiritual goals.

00:24:41.563 --> 00:24:43.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because if we don’t have goals,

00:24:43.165 --> 00:24:47.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s like going on a journey
with no direction, no destination.

00:24:48.503 --> 00:24:52.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we’ve got a purpose before leaving,
we know where we are going 

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how we can get there safely.

00:24:54.309 --> 00:24:57.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
I always think in terms
of setting short-range goals,

00:24:57.546 --> 00:25:00.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
medium-range goals, and long-range goals.

00:25:00.282 --> 00:25:02.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
So some goals that I was able to reach

00:25:02.384 --> 00:25:05.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
were getting baptized
and becoming a regular pioneer.

00:25:05.353 --> 00:25:08.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also had the privilege 
of serving in construction groups.

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:11.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter the choices that I had to make,

00:25:11.793 --> 00:25:15.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
I always thought about how
they would affect my goals in the future.

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:17.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was 17,

00:25:17.799 --> 00:25:20.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
I found out that my mum had cancer.

00:25:20.936 --> 00:25:23.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was a heartbreaking situation.

00:25:23.305 --> 00:25:26.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suddenly, my life was turned upside down.

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:32.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to learn how to care for our home,
how to cook,

00:25:32.147 --> 00:25:34.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to care for someone sick,

00:25:34.349 --> 00:25:37.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how to give emotional support
to that person.

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
The biggest challenge that I faced
when I was a teenager

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:44.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
was when my parents got divorced,

00:25:44.826 --> 00:25:47.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then my mum stopped serving Jehovah.

00:25:47.862 --> 00:25:52.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that time in my life,
I was 15 or 16 years old.

00:25:52.334 --> 00:25:54.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that age, you need a lot of support

00:25:54.736 --> 00:25:56.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
and guidance from your parents.

00:25:56.738 --> 00:26:00.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a time when I didn’t get
that guidance and that support.

00:26:00.542 --> 00:26:05.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mum was my best friend, and I lost her.

00:26:06.915 --> 00:26:09.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was always so loving.

00:26:10.118 --> 00:26:12.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
She always helped me.

00:26:12.754 --> 00:26:15.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
She always read the publications with me.

00:26:15.857 --> 00:26:18.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
We loved to study the Bible together.

00:26:21.229 --> 00:26:24.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know when problems
will suddenly come up.

00:26:27.035 --> 00:26:29.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s important that we take

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:31.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s side before the challenges,

00:26:31.539 --> 00:26:33.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
before problems, arise.

00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:37.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
A text that really helped me

00:26:37.579 --> 00:26:40.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
was Romans 8:37-39.

00:26:40.949 --> 00:26:43.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it says that ‘neither death

00:26:43.118 --> 00:26:45.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘nor life nor height nor depth

00:26:45.987 --> 00:26:48.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘nor anything else

00:26:48.056 --> 00:26:50.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
can separate us from Jehovah’s love.’

00:26:50.859 --> 00:26:53.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that really helped me
face those challenges.

00:26:53.461 --> 00:26:57.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Having a strong Christian identity

00:26:57.332 --> 00:27:00.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
means having values and principles

00:27:00.969 --> 00:27:03.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are the same as Jehovah’s.

00:27:04.172 --> 00:27:07.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
You clearly make up your mind
to please Jehovah,

00:27:07.309 --> 00:27:10.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
even with what’s happening all around you.

00:27:10.745 --> 00:27:13.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s very important to make
the choice to serve Jehovah

00:27:13.615 --> 00:27:16.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter the situation we face

00:27:16.284 --> 00:27:20.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
or no matter if our family
serves Jehovah or not,

00:27:20.689 --> 00:27:23.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it’s when we face
challenging situations

00:27:23.692 --> 00:27:27.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’ll see if we can continue
to be loyal to Jehovah or not.

00:27:27.128 --> 00:27:29.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt about it,

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:32.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m very proud
to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:27:32.534 --> 00:27:35.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah can help us in amazing ways.

00:27:36.371 --> 00:27:41.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is our Friend,
our Father, our Comforter.

00:27:41.343 --> 00:27:45.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s really good to be friends
with a God that is so powerful

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:48.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to have the chance to defend his name.

00:28:10.672 --> 00:28:13.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Establishing your identity as a Christian

00:28:13.942 --> 00:28:17.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
isn’t a single decision
or just a moment in time.

00:28:17.912 --> 00:28:21.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Tainara and Alex shared,

00:28:21.249 --> 00:28:25.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s a process
that leads to wonderful blessings.

00:28:26.321 --> 00:28:29.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
In many respects, marriage is like that.

00:28:29.591 --> 00:28:32.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
A wedding is a special day,

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
but marriage is something
that wives and husbands

00:28:35.697 --> 00:28:38.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
need to strengthen every day.

00:28:40.068 --> 00:28:42.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
To help Christian couples,

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:44.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body has approved
the development

00:28:44.906 --> 00:28:47.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a new series.

00:28:47.275 --> 00:28:51.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s called <i>For a Happy Marriage.</i>

00:28:52.013 --> 00:28:55.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each segment features dramatizations

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:57.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
of real marital challenges

00:28:57.619 --> 00:29:00.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how Bible principles can help us

00:29:00.922 --> 00:29:04.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
build healthy, loving relationships.

00:29:04.626 --> 00:29:06.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s our first episode.

00:29:28.016 --> 00:29:29.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
As married couples,

00:29:32.053 --> 00:29:34.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
most of us have been there.

00:29:37.058 --> 00:29:39.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
The day-to-day pace of life,

00:29:40.995 --> 00:29:42.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
work,

00:29:44.466 --> 00:29:47.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
and distractions

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:50.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
can cause us

00:29:50.505 --> 00:29:53.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
to draw away from our mate emotionally.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
We begin to talk less

00:30:10.291 --> 00:30:12.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
—distance ourselves.

00:30:16.865 --> 00:30:18.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may feel unappreciated

00:30:28.009 --> 00:30:30.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even become cold or unkind.

00:30:32.847 --> 00:30:37.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even our desire for intimacy and affection
may cool.

00:30:37.118 --> 00:30:39.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may go from being loving and passionate

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:45.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
to platonic roommates.

00:30:47.428 --> 00:30:49.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can we do to avoid this?

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
An excellent principle we can apply

00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:58.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
is found at Acts 20:35:

00:30:58.606 --> 00:31:00.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There is more happiness

00:31:00.642 --> 00:31:03.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
in giving than there is in receiving.”

00:31:07.248 --> 00:31:09.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how can we know what to give

00:31:11.586 --> 00:31:13.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
or what actions to take so our mate

00:31:13.621 --> 00:31:15.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
feels our love and affection?

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:22.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
The best way to know

00:31:22.096 --> 00:31:24.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
is simply to ask.

00:31:25.533 --> 00:31:28.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does our mate need?

00:31:33.675 --> 00:31:36.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some feel loved

00:31:36.411 --> 00:31:40.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they are actively listened to

00:31:40.014 --> 00:31:43.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
or hear warm expressions of appreciation.

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:49.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
For others, it’s expressions of love
shown through touch

00:31:49.757 --> 00:31:51.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
or simply quality time.

00:31:53.027 --> 00:31:54.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others find

00:31:54.329 --> 00:31:58.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
that helping them with chores
and sharing the workload at home

00:31:58.766 --> 00:32:01.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
makes them feel cherished.

00:32:03.237 --> 00:32:05.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
But whatever the discussion reveals

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:08.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
and regardless of our mate’s imperfections,

00:32:13.648 --> 00:32:15.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want to do what we can

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:19.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make them feel loved and cared for

00:32:20.421 --> 00:32:24.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
through the actions they appreciate.

00:32:32.133 --> 00:32:37.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, if we each do all we can
to show unselfish love,

00:32:40.508 --> 00:32:42.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
genuine affection will follow.

00:32:50.184 --> 00:32:53.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is just one of many secrets

00:32:53.855 --> 00:32:56.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a happy marriage.

00:33:01.396 --> 00:33:05.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now, why not just take a moment,
pause the video,

00:33:05.933 --> 00:33:09.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ask each other these three questions.

00:33:10.204 --> 00:33:13.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, share your honest feelings,

00:33:13.374 --> 00:33:16.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when listening, don’t be defensive.

00:33:16.611 --> 00:33:20.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is simply a chance to openly express
how each of you feels.

00:33:21.949 --> 00:33:26.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
So pause your video now, and really talk.

00:33:29.791 --> 00:33:33.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we see, this series is designed
to encourage couples

00:33:33.961 --> 00:33:37.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have open and honest discussions
with each other.

00:33:37.999 --> 00:33:41.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
These videos will be so helpful
for husbands and wives

00:33:41.469 --> 00:33:44.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for those who are thinking
about getting married.

00:33:44.639 --> 00:33:47.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are thankful to the Governing Body
for this series,

00:33:47.975 --> 00:33:50.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we look forward to future episodes.

00:33:51.746 --> 00:33:55.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whether we are married or single,
have children or not,

00:33:55.349 --> 00:33:58.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of us are part of Jehovah’s family.

00:33:58.286 --> 00:34:01.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love each other and help one another,

00:34:01.322 --> 00:34:04.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially during times of distress.

00:34:04.492 --> 00:34:08.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our next segment, we’ll see
how Jehovah’s spiritual family

00:34:08.696 --> 00:34:13.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped Brother Baston Nyirenda
endure years of intense hardship.

00:41:10.117 --> 00:41:12.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
How faith-strengthening to see

00:41:12.286 --> 00:41:17.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
how the brotherhood was a powerful source
of encouragement for Brother Nyirenda!

00:41:17.224 --> 00:41:20.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, persecution continues to affect

00:41:20.361 --> 00:41:22.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
many of our brothers today.

00:41:22.663 --> 00:41:24.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s spiritual family

00:41:24.732 --> 00:41:29.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
steadfastly prays for and helps
each one of them to endure.

00:41:30.337 --> 00:41:33.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, we’ll enjoy a recent morning worship

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:36.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
presented by Brother William Malenfant.

00:41:36.577 --> 00:41:40.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
He describes the power of parental training.

00:41:43.217 --> 00:41:45.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think all of us have had

00:41:45.219 --> 00:41:48.389 line:10% position:50% align:center
very interesting experiences with young ones,

00:41:48.389 --> 00:41:49.823 line:10% position:50% align:center
and we could go on quite a while

00:41:49.823 --> 00:41:51.825 line:10% position:50% align:center
speaking about them.

00:41:51.825 --> 00:41:53.627 line:10% position:50% align:center
But there is a story

00:41:53.627 --> 00:41:57.064 line:10% position:50% align:center
about a “child psychologist

00:41:57.064 --> 00:42:02.069 line:10% position:50% align:center
“who began his practice with four theories

00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:05.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and no children. . . .

00:42:05.005 --> 00:42:08.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Some years later he found
that he had four children

00:42:08.976 --> 00:42:10.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
and no theories!”

00:42:12.346 --> 00:42:15.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
He learned that there was quite a bit to do.

00:42:15.983 --> 00:42:18.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a lot to do to raise a child.

00:42:18.485 --> 00:42:21.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was far more than just a few theories.

00:42:21.722 --> 00:42:26.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this was a comment that was reported
by psychologist Bruce Narramore

00:42:26.427 --> 00:42:31.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
and published in the <i>Awake! </i>
of April 8, 1981.

00:42:31.432 --> 00:42:35.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
So theories about child raising come and go,

00:42:35.169 --> 00:42:39.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the best counsel on raising a child,
of course, is found in the Bible.

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:43.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that, because it’s been there
for thousands of years,

00:42:43.744 --> 00:42:45.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s consistent.

00:42:45.746 --> 00:42:48.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s consistently successful.

00:42:48.549 --> 00:42:50.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s another interesting point

00:42:50.551 --> 00:42:53.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there is four times as much counsel

00:42:53.787 --> 00:42:56.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
given to children in the book of Proverbs

00:42:56.523 --> 00:42:58.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
as given to adults.

00:42:58.959 --> 00:43:02.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
That might surprise you,
but that’s what I read, so I believe it.

00:43:04.231 --> 00:43:09.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 22:6 is a familiar scripture
for all of us.

00:43:09.169 --> 00:43:13.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 22:6, and here it says:

00:43:13.374 --> 00:43:17.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Train a boy in the way he should go;

00:43:17.211 --> 00:43:21.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when he grows old
he will not depart from it.”

00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:24.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is that true?

00:43:24.985 --> 00:43:27.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, it’s true.

00:43:27.087 --> 00:43:29.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does it mean that in every case

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:32.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
a boy that’s well-trained by his parents
won’t depart from it?

00:43:32.593 --> 00:43:35.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.
It does not mean that.

00:43:35.095 --> 00:43:37.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s giving a general, overall view

00:43:37.798 --> 00:43:39.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what will take place

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:43.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
if a child is trained properly
by his parents.

00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:48.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what it is,
this is an interesting brief statement

00:43:48.042 --> 00:43:51.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
from <i>The Watchtower</i>  of 2008, April 1st

00:43:51.679 --> 00:43:55.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if a child is trained
according to the Bible’s counsel,

00:43:55.482 --> 00:43:58.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
the parent or parents “are creating

00:43:58.552 --> 00:44:01.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the most favorable circumstances

00:44:01.255 --> 00:44:04.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bring about a marvelous result.”

00:44:04.491 --> 00:44:06.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
That marvelous result is

00:44:06.627 --> 00:44:09.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
a faithful servant of Jehovah God.

00:44:09.897 --> 00:44:12.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we can turn to Proverbs 23:24

00:44:12.766 --> 00:44:16.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
where reference is made to that

00:44:16.337 --> 00:44:18.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Proverbs 23:24.

00:44:18.339 --> 00:44:21.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how many parents are so delighted
with their children,

00:44:21.909 --> 00:44:26.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially in the case of so many
who are serving at Bethel!

00:44:26.046 --> 00:44:29.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
There at Proverbs 23:24, it says:

00:44:29.149 --> 00:44:33.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The father of a righteous one
will surely be joyful;

00:44:33.554 --> 00:44:37.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
whoever fathers a wise son
will rejoice in him.”

00:44:37.424 --> 00:44:41.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it does; it brings great pleasure
to parents when that happens.

00:44:41.562 --> 00:44:44.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there’s another side to the coin.

00:44:44.264 --> 00:44:47.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite the most earnest efforts of parents,

00:44:47.701 --> 00:44:50.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
some children do become unfaithful.

00:44:52.239 --> 00:44:53.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about Solomon.

00:44:53.607 --> 00:44:56.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wasn’t a child, but actually,

00:44:56.810 --> 00:44:58.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s very difficult to understand

00:44:58.812 --> 00:45:03.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
how that man turned away from Jehovah
in his old age, but he did.

00:45:03.117 --> 00:45:06.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then even Jehovah had sons
who proved unfaithful.

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:09.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what the June 1, 2007,<i> Watchtower </i>

00:45:09.656 --> 00:45:11.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
showed clearly,
and we’re all familiar with it

00:45:11.492 --> 00:45:15.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the angels who turned away
from their Father, their Creator.

00:45:15.496 --> 00:45:17.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
And something to keep in mind

00:45:17.865 --> 00:45:20.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
for parents, particularly,
who have really tried hard

00:45:20.901 --> 00:45:22.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
to raise their children properly,

00:45:24.004 --> 00:45:27.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
we don’t want to see them
beat themselves figuratively speaking,

00:45:27.508 --> 00:45:29.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
on and on for years and years

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:32.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they feel like they’re failures.

00:45:32.079 --> 00:45:33.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
They should not do that.

00:45:33.747 --> 00:45:36.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do you account
—if it seems to some parents

00:45:36.717 --> 00:45:38.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
that know somehow they failed—

00:45:38.552 --> 00:45:41.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well then, how do you account for children

00:45:41.088 --> 00:45:44.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
who receive no help whatsoever
from their parents

00:45:44.024 --> 00:45:47.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they love Jehovah
and they come into the truth?

00:45:47.661 --> 00:45:50.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s heart—heart condition.

00:45:50.898 --> 00:45:55.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
So parents would be wise
to focus on the future and what they can do,

00:45:55.436 --> 00:45:57.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to look back and beat themselves

00:45:57.971 --> 00:46:00.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
over problems of the past.

00:46:00.774 --> 00:46:05.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even when children do turn aside
from serving Jehovah,

00:46:05.112 --> 00:46:09.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
parents who have
conscientiously trained their children

00:46:09.082 --> 00:46:10.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the way to walk,

00:46:10.851 --> 00:46:12.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
they can still entertain the hope

00:46:12.886 --> 00:46:15.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
that those young ones
will come back some day.

00:46:15.923 --> 00:46:18.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
We never give up on our kids.

00:46:18.892 --> 00:46:22.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t give up
on our close friends or siblings

00:46:22.262 --> 00:46:24.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
who may have walked away from the truth.

00:46:24.264 --> 00:46:27.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
We always hope that they’ll come back.

00:46:27.334 --> 00:46:30.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 19:7 is interesting

00:46:30.838 --> 00:46:35.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Psalm 19:7—

00:46:35.342 --> 00:46:39.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
speaking of the reminders of Jehovah.

00:46:39.646 --> 00:46:44.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it reads: “The law of Jehovah
is perfect, restoring strength.”

00:46:44.485 --> 00:46:48.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then it says:
“The reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy,

00:46:48.455 --> 00:46:52.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
making the inexperienced one wise.”

00:46:52.359 --> 00:46:55.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, for those who leave the truth,

00:46:55.128 --> 00:46:58.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
many times it’s reminders
that come back to them

00:46:58.265 --> 00:47:02.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the way it was at home,
the counsel they received from their parents,

00:47:02.369 --> 00:47:06.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
the loving congregation that they attended.

00:47:06.273 --> 00:47:11.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
And who comes to mind when you think
about the reminders coming to mind

00:47:11.278 --> 00:47:14.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
after living a life of debauchery?

00:47:14.047 --> 00:47:16.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
The prodigal son.

00:47:16.049 --> 00:47:20.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was at his lowest,
and then who did he remember?

00:47:20.053 --> 00:47:23.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
His father
—his father, who undoubtedly had shown

00:47:23.524 --> 00:47:25.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
kindness and love to him.

00:47:25.526 --> 00:47:27.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we don’t want to overlook

00:47:27.528 --> 00:47:30.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
the power there is in parental training.

00:47:30.964 --> 00:47:33.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though they may not respond

00:47:33.267 --> 00:47:36.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
—children may not respond—
immediately,

00:47:36.169 --> 00:47:38.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
they do many times later on.

00:47:38.171 --> 00:47:40.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they go through experiences in life,
sometimes,

00:47:40.541 --> 00:47:45.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
that wake them up
to the facts of life and reality.

00:47:45.445 --> 00:47:48.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
The truth is there are
thousands upon thousands

00:47:48.148 --> 00:47:50.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
of children of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:47:50.317 --> 00:47:53.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are being raised in the truth
and whose way “is pure and right.”

00:47:53.921 --> 00:47:57.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
It really is thrilling to see young ones
who are able to think.

00:47:57.624 --> 00:47:59.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
They don’t just parrot
what their parents tell them.

00:47:59.927 --> 00:48:02.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re not just memorizing things.

00:48:02.029 --> 00:48:05.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ve learned to have thinking ability,
and they can speak about the truth.

00:48:05.766 --> 00:48:09.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
They defend the truth
in a very interesting way.

00:48:09.903 --> 00:48:14.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Britain, Tim and Sam, both 11 years old
and unbaptized publishers,

00:48:14.908 --> 00:48:18.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
were engaging in field service
with Tim’s mother.

00:48:18.545 --> 00:48:22.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
The boys needed new bags
to carry their Bibles and literature,

00:48:22.616 --> 00:48:25.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
but money was a problem.

00:48:25.218 --> 00:48:28.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
Earlier, before starting
in the field service that day,

00:48:28.121 --> 00:48:32.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
the mothers of the two publishers
made this a subject of prayer.

00:48:32.926 --> 00:48:35.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the last house to be visited that morning,

00:48:35.696 --> 00:48:39.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tim spoke to the householder
and read a Bible verse to her.

00:48:39.866 --> 00:48:43.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
She interrupted him
to ask what his religion was.

00:48:43.804 --> 00:48:47.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Tim replied
that he was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:49.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
the woman scolded him

00:48:49.142 --> 00:48:51.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
and said to his mother
that she could not understand

00:48:51.645 --> 00:48:54.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
why Jehovah’s Witnesses
let their children die

00:48:54.348 --> 00:48:58.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather than allow them
to accept blood transfusions.

00:48:58.118 --> 00:49:01.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that would be a difficult thing
to have thrown in your face

00:49:01.154 --> 00:49:04.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a young man there at the door
with his mother.

00:49:04.091 --> 00:49:07.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tim’s mother suggested
that the woman ask the boys

00:49:07.894 --> 00:49:10.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
how they felt about this.

00:49:10.631 --> 00:49:12.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
She did.

00:49:12.232 --> 00:49:16.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tim explained that he would always choose
alternative treatment

00:49:16.169 --> 00:49:19.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather than go against
his Bible-trained conscience.

00:49:19.473 --> 00:49:23.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was from this young boy himself.

00:49:23.310 --> 00:49:26.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sam then said, the other young boy,

00:49:26.513 --> 00:49:29.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
that his own sister
had received alternative treatment

00:49:29.583 --> 00:49:33.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
and had fared better
than patients who had received blood.

00:49:35.522 --> 00:49:38.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then the householder
again turned to Tim’s mother,

00:49:38.358 --> 00:49:41.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this time she expressed disapproval

00:49:41.294 --> 00:49:44.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
of taking young children from door to door.

00:49:44.097 --> 00:49:46.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve heard that many times, I’m sure.

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:50.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both of the boys responded to the woman
on this occasion

00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:53.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they enjoyed preaching,
adding that they preferred this

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:57.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
to roaming the streets
like others of their age.

00:49:57.511 --> 00:50:00.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this slowed the householder down a bit.

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:02.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was impressed by their reply.

00:50:02.416 --> 00:50:04.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
The householder asked the boys
to wait a moment

00:50:04.818 --> 00:50:06.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
while she went into her house.

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:11.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a surprise they had when she returned
and presented each of them

00:50:11.458 --> 00:50:14.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a smart, new, leather bag

00:50:14.194 --> 00:50:16.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
ideal for their ministry!

00:50:16.563 --> 00:50:19.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
She sold these items for a living.

00:50:19.066 --> 00:50:23.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Her changed attitude also allowed the boys
to arrange for a return visit.

00:50:23.904 --> 00:50:25.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as they were leaving,

00:50:25.906 --> 00:50:29.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
the householder’s 94-year-old mother,
who had been listening,

00:50:29.976 --> 00:50:32.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
came to the door and asked Tim’s mother

00:50:32.779 --> 00:50:35.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
to visit her at her home.

00:50:35.982 --> 00:50:38.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truly, we are proud of our young ones.

00:50:38.552 --> 00:50:41.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s a delight when you hear them

00:50:41.221 --> 00:50:44.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
make comments at the meetings
in their own words

00:50:44.858 --> 00:50:47.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when you are out
in the field ministry with them

00:50:47.694 --> 00:50:50.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you see them make expressions of faith.

00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:54.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have thousands upon thousands
of good children

00:50:54.835 --> 00:50:58.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
who really are showing that they’re mature
and that they love Jehovah God.

00:51:00.741 --> 00:51:03.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our program, we have been reminded

00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:08.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
that each of us
belongs to a loving, global family

00:51:08.115 --> 00:51:10.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jehovah’s family.

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:13.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as our new music video shows,

00:51:13.253 --> 00:51:17.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
each of us can help others
become part of our spiritual family.

00:51:36.243 --> 00:51:43.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this world,
it’s hard to find a friend—

00:51:43.450 --> 00:51:50.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
Someone you can turn to
who’s with you till the end.

00:51:50.857 --> 00:51:57.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
I used to dream
I’d find a people who could be

00:51:57.731 --> 00:52:08.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
More than just some friends
and more like family.

00:52:12.979 --> 00:52:20.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
My search is over.
I’ve come to know

00:52:20.253 --> 00:52:28.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve finally found God’s people;
I feel the love they show.

00:52:28.061 --> 00:52:35.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I live that dream
that meant so much to me.

00:52:35.135 --> 00:52:43.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
I found more than friends;
I found Jehovah’s family.

00:52:43.977 --> 00:52:54.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I have brothers;
I have sisters, mothers, fathers too,

00:52:54.321 --> 00:53:01.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
Little boys and little girls,
older brothers who

00:53:01.394 --> 00:53:10.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come from ev’ry tribe
and race and nationality.

00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:18.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love to be part
of Jehovah’s family.

00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:26.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love each other;
our bond is strong.

00:53:26.486 --> 00:53:34.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love to have the honor
of knowing we belong

00:53:34.194 --> 00:53:51.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the greatest brotherhood we’ll ever see.
We love to be part of Jehovah’s family.

00:54:07.227 --> 00:54:25.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we come from ev’ry race and nationality.
We love to be part of Jehovah’s family.

00:54:26.279 --> 00:54:32.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our God invites us
to be more than a friend.

00:54:32.953 --> 00:54:40.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants us in his fam’ly;
his love will never end.

00:54:40.927 --> 00:54:47.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just to think
that we will live eternally,

00:54:47.834 --> 00:55:06.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we’ll all be part of Jehovah’s family—
A part of Jehovah’s family,

00:55:10.357 --> 00:55:22.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
Family,
Family.

00:55:28.408 --> 00:55:30.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
What an encouraging video

00:55:30.643 --> 00:55:34.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
and an appropriate one
for this month’s broadcast,

00:55:34.047 --> 00:55:36.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
which has been all about family!

00:55:37.884 --> 00:55:40.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
Alex, thank you for being my cohost.

00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:42.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re welcome, Gerrit.

00:55:42.989 --> 00:55:44.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our program,

00:55:44.624 --> 00:55:47.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were reminded that our animated series

00:55:47.761 --> 00:55:51.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Become Jehovah’s Friend</i>
is a very effective teaching tool

00:55:51.231 --> 00:55:55.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
that continues to delight
and help children and parents.

00:55:55.969 --> 00:56:00.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
We learned how teens can develop
a strong identity as a servant of Jehovah

00:56:00.974 --> 00:56:05.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how this helps them
stand firm for their convictions.

00:56:05.545 --> 00:56:10.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we introduced an encouraging new series,
<i>For a Happy Marriage,</i>

00:56:10.216 --> 00:56:12.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we were reminded of the importance

00:56:12.218 --> 00:56:14.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
of showing our marriage mate affection.

00:56:15.822 --> 00:56:19.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now it’s time for our video postcard,
which comes to us

00:56:19.826 --> 00:56:22.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Zambia.

00:56:22.429 --> 00:56:25.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Situated in south-central Africa,

00:56:25.598 --> 00:56:29.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zambia is a land of vast open spaces,

00:56:29.002 --> 00:56:31.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
abundant wildlife,

00:56:31.204 --> 00:56:34.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
and spectacular waterways.

00:56:34.207 --> 00:56:37.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
It takes its name from the Zambezi River,

00:56:37.143 --> 00:56:40.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
which flows into Victoria Falls.

00:56:40.513 --> 00:56:42.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
Particularly at flood stage,

00:56:42.582 --> 00:56:47.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
Victoria Falls is considered
the largest sheet of falling water on earth,

00:56:47.587 --> 00:56:50.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
with up to 144 million gallons,

00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:54.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
or 545 million liters,

00:56:54.594 --> 00:56:57.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
plunging over the falls every minute.

00:56:58.798 --> 00:57:00.066 line:10% position:50% align:center
In the past,

00:57:00.066 --> 00:57:01.901 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses in Zambia

00:57:01.901 --> 00:57:03.403 line:10% position:50% align:center
faced strong opposition

00:57:03.403 --> 00:57:05.672 line:10% position:50% align:center
fueled by nationalism.

00:57:05.672 --> 00:57:08.074 line:10% position:50% align:center
During the 1960’s,

00:57:08.074 --> 00:57:11.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
thousands of children of Jehovah’s Witnesses
were expelled from school

00:57:11.778 --> 00:57:14.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
for refusing to salute the flag.

00:57:14.514 --> 00:57:16.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
Door-to-door preaching was banned.

00:57:17.517 --> 00:57:18.918 line:10% position:50% align:center
But with Jehovah’s help,

00:57:18.918 --> 00:57:21.354 line:10% position:50% align:center
the brothers persevered

00:57:21.354 --> 00:57:24.090 line:10% position:50% align:center
and many have embraced the truth.

00:57:24.090 --> 00:57:26.092 line:10% position:50% align:center
Today Zambia is home

00:57:26.092 --> 00:57:31.064 line:10% position:50% align:center
to more than 225,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:57:31.064 --> 00:57:34.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
To serve publishers
in areas with poor network service,

00:57:34.734 --> 00:57:37.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
the circuit overseer prerecords his talks,

00:57:37.570 --> 00:57:40.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
transfers the files onto a flash drive,

00:57:40.306 --> 00:57:44.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
and delivers the files to the elders,
who then distribute the talks.

00:57:46.112 --> 00:57:49.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s visit
the Lusaka Rockfield Congregation.

00:57:50.383 --> 00:57:53.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:57:53.887 --> 00:57:56.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brothers showed
great zeal in the ministry.

00:57:57.390 --> 00:58:01.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
The congregation grew to the point
that a new congregation was formed

00:58:01.127 --> 00:58:03.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
to support the territory.

00:58:03.163 --> 00:58:06.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
Attendance at meetings and assemblies
during the pandemic

00:58:06.466 --> 00:58:08.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
was strong.

00:58:08.468 --> 00:58:12.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Young ones in the congregation
help translate Kingdom songs.

00:58:13.373 --> 00:58:15.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers and sisters

00:58:15.375 --> 00:58:19.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Lusaka Rockfield Congregation
in Zambia send you

00:58:19.879 --> 00:58:22.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
their love and greetings!

00:58:22.582 --> 00:58:27.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we send our love to all of you as well.

00:58:27.587 --> 00:58:30.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:58:30.890 --> 00:58:33.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting!
