WEBVTT

00:00:02.652 --> 00:00:07.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
We extend a warm welcome to all of you.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re so happy to have you join us

00:00:10.126 --> 00:00:13.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
for this month’s broadcast.

00:00:13.196 --> 00:00:16.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s a little sample
of what will be contained

00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:18.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our program.

00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:20.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 3:5 tells us

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “trust in Jehovah with all [our] heart.”

00:00:24.374 --> 00:00:26.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll see how three brothers

00:00:26.543 --> 00:00:29.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
facing different challenges
overcame them

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:33.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
by trusting in Jehovah completely.

00:00:34.217 --> 00:00:37.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though personal attacks may start small,

00:00:37.153 --> 00:00:41.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
being bullied can quickly make you feel
alone and worthless,

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:43.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
wondering, ‘Why me?’

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this month’s <i>My Teen Life,</i>

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll hear how Charlie and Ferin
learned to cope with bullies

00:00:51.067 --> 00:00:55.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
and grew stronger and more confident
as a result.

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:58.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in a new dramatization,

00:00:58.007 --> 00:01:02.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll reconnect with two dear friends,
Neeta and Jade,

00:01:02.212 --> 00:01:05.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see how they remain loyal

00:01:05.448 --> 00:01:10.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
when confronted with false reports
about the truth.

00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:13.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, there’s much to look forward to

00:01:13.556 --> 00:01:18.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this September 2022 edition

00:01:18.428 --> 00:01:21.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
of JW Broadcasting®.

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:42.318 line:10% position:50% align:center
The theme for this program is

00:01:42.318 --> 00:01:44.354 line:10% position:50% align:center
“As Jehovah’s Sheep,

00:01:44.354 --> 00:01:48.391 line:10% position:50% align:center
Reject ‘the Voice of Strangers’!”

00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:50.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s estimated that there may be

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
15 million animal species on earth today.

00:01:54.898 --> 00:01:57.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
But of all these animals,

00:01:57.066 --> 00:02:01.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
which one is most often used in the Bible
to represent good people?

00:02:01.905 --> 00:02:03.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sheep!

00:02:03.573 --> 00:02:06.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus often used this illustration.

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:08.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here are three examples.

00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:11.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, to his 12 apostles, he said

00:02:11.014 --> 00:02:13.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Matthew 10:16:

00:02:13.483 --> 00:02:16.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am sending you out as sheep

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:18.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
among wolves.”

00:02:18.655 --> 00:02:22.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, regarding what he’ll do
shortly before Armageddon,

00:02:22.692 --> 00:02:25.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said at Matthew 25:32, 33

00:02:25.628 --> 00:02:29.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “he will separate people
one from another,

00:02:29.933 --> 00:02:33.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just as a shepherd separates the sheep

00:02:33.303 --> 00:02:35.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the goats.”

00:02:35.305 --> 00:02:39.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
In subsequent verses,
he describes how the sheep

00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:41.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
will inherit everlasting life

00:02:41.444 --> 00:02:45.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the goats will depart
into everlasting destruction.

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:49.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our third example: Jesus said

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
at John 10:16:

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:56.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have other sheep,
which are not of this fold;

00:02:56.626 --> 00:02:59.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
“those too I must bring in,

00:02:59.162 --> 00:03:02.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they will listen to my voice,

00:03:02.031 --> 00:03:05.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they will become one flock,
one shepherd.”

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
But a question arises:

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:12.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why did Jesus use a sheep illustration

00:03:12.675 --> 00:03:16.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
to represent people
who will gain everlasting life?

00:03:16.846 --> 00:03:20.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Undoubtedly, it was
because of the desirable qualities

00:03:20.583 --> 00:03:22.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
literal sheep have.

00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:27.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re gregarious,
having a liking for companionship.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
They don’t like to be alone.

00:03:29.692 --> 00:03:32.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s a good thing
because without the flock

00:03:32.662 --> 00:03:34.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the protection of the shepherd,

00:03:34.797 --> 00:03:39.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re defenseless
if a lion or a bear approaches.

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:43.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
About all they can do is bleat, “Baa.”

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Goodbye, little sheep.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another good quality is that sheep as a whole

00:03:50.713 --> 00:03:54.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
tend to be peaceful, inoffensive

00:03:54.183 --> 00:03:56.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
—very different from goats.

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
As little boys, my brother and I would pet
the goats that my grandfather had,

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:04.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
but if we turned our backs on them,

00:04:04.127 --> 00:04:06.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
one would often sneak up behind us

00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:10.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
and butt us for no reason.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
These are some
of the desirable characteristics

00:04:13.937 --> 00:04:18.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
that make sheep an appropriate illustration
for good people.

00:04:19.108 --> 00:04:22.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the quality
we especially want to focus on

00:04:22.712 --> 00:04:26.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
is identified at John chapter 10,

00:04:26.182 --> 00:04:28.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 4 and 5.

00:04:28.818 --> 00:04:31.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When he [that is, the shepherd]

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
“has brought all his own out,

00:04:33.856 --> 00:04:35.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he goes ahead of them,

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:40.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the sheep follow him,
because they know his voice.

00:04:40.563 --> 00:04:44.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They will by no means follow a stranger

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but will flee from him,

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:51.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they do not know
the voice of strangers.”

00:04:51.674 --> 00:04:54.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the desirable quality?

00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:57.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sheep listen to the voice of their shepherd

00:04:57.847 --> 00:05:01.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reject the voice of strangers.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regarding this quality of sheep,

00:05:03.686 --> 00:05:07.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
the September 1, 2004, <i>Watchtower </i> said this:

00:05:08.191 --> 00:05:12.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A book on Bible lands relates
that a visitor once claimed

00:05:12.895 --> 00:05:17.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that sheep recognize their shepherd
by his dress, not his voice.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A shepherd answered
that it was the voice they knew.

00:05:20.803 --> 00:05:24.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To prove this, he exchanged clothing
with the stranger.

00:05:24.841 --> 00:05:29.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Dressed in the shepherd’s garb,
the stranger called the sheep,

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:32.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but they did not respond.

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:34.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They did not know his voice.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Yet, when the shepherd called them,

00:05:37.186 --> 00:05:42.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
though he was disguised,
the sheep came at once.”

00:05:42.658 --> 00:05:44.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please ask yourself,

00:05:44.894 --> 00:05:47.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘As one of Jehovah’s figurative sheep,

00:05:47.563 --> 00:05:51.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘do I obediently respond
to the voice of the Fine Shepherd

00:05:51.834 --> 00:05:54.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
and flee from the voice of strangers?’

00:05:54.837 --> 00:05:56.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s talk about this.

00:05:56.839 --> 00:06:01.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
The original stranger was Satan the Devil.

00:06:01.044 --> 00:06:05.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like a ventriloquist,
he made a serpent appear to talk,

00:06:05.648 --> 00:06:08.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the words were Satan’s words.

00:06:08.551 --> 00:06:13.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan thereby used his voice
to slander Jehovah

00:06:13.556 --> 00:06:15.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
and deceive Eve.

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:21.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, Satan continues his work
as an evil ventriloquist

00:06:21.264 --> 00:06:25.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
using, not serpents, but human puppets

00:06:25.034 --> 00:06:27.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
to enunciate his voice

00:06:27.737 --> 00:06:29.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
—these acting as his agents

00:06:29.972 --> 00:06:33.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
either wittingly or unwittingly.

00:06:34.444 --> 00:06:37.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now let’s discuss three examples

00:06:37.847 --> 00:06:41.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
of how our Fine Shepherd tells us one thing

00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:44.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Satan’s underlings, or strangers,

00:06:44.587 --> 00:06:47.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
tell us something opposite.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must be vigilant to listen

00:06:50.993 --> 00:06:53.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the right voice.

00:06:53.696 --> 00:06:58.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our Fine Shepherd tells us,
as our first example,

00:06:58.167 --> 00:07:02.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
these words at Matthew chapter 24,

00:07:02.705 --> 00:07:05.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 45-47:

00:07:06.142 --> 00:07:10.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who really is the faithful
and discreet slave

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:14.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
“whom his master appointed
over his domestics,

00:07:14.217 --> 00:07:16.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to give them their food at the proper time?

00:07:16.786 --> 00:07:21.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Happy is that slave if his master on coming

00:07:21.357 --> 00:07:23.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
“finds him doing so!

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:26.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Truly I say to you, he will appoint him

00:07:26.896 --> 00:07:29.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
over all his belongings.”

00:07:29.832 --> 00:07:32.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know the Master, Jesus,

00:07:32.401 --> 00:07:35.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
found “the faithful and discreet slave”

00:07:35.071 --> 00:07:39.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
spiritually feeding
righthearted ones in 1919,

00:07:39.609 --> 00:07:41.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
and at a future time

00:07:41.911 --> 00:07:46.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will appoint him over all his belongings.”

00:07:46.215 --> 00:07:48.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the implication?

00:07:48.251 --> 00:07:50.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Obviously, even now,

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:55.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus fully trusts the faithful slave.

00:07:55.158 --> 00:07:57.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
And all of us,

00:07:57.693 --> 00:07:59.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
even individual members
of the Governing Body,

00:07:59.929 --> 00:08:02.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
should do the same.

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:06.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what does the voice of strangers
say on this subject?

00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:09.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Don’t trust the faithful slave.

00:08:09.705 --> 00:08:12.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will mislead you!”

00:08:12.208 --> 00:08:14.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
And who often have the loudest voice

00:08:14.944 --> 00:08:17.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
promoting this false message?

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
Apostates.

00:08:20.016 --> 00:08:24.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hebrews 13:9 labels false messages

00:08:24.253 --> 00:08:26.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
as “strange teachings.”

00:08:26.822 --> 00:08:30.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, they are the teachings of strangers.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some examples of their strange teachings

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:38.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
are that the faithful slave
protects pedophiles

00:08:38.534 --> 00:08:41.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
or that the slave will exploit you

00:08:41.837 --> 00:08:45.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they can live lives of luxury.

00:08:45.374 --> 00:08:50.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those are both bald-faced lies.

00:08:51.714 --> 00:08:55.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acts 20:30 says that apostates

00:08:55.284 --> 00:08:58.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
“speak twisted things.”

00:08:58.154 --> 00:09:02.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
They do this
in order to draw God’s sheep away

00:09:02.124 --> 00:09:05.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make them followers of themselves.

00:09:05.228 --> 00:09:08.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something that’s twisted
is bent out of shape,

00:09:08.664 --> 00:09:11.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
or distorted.

00:09:11.167 --> 00:09:15.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
They speak twisted things
by leaving out vital details,

00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:18.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
taking things out of context,

00:09:18.174 --> 00:09:21.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
or in some other way manipulating a truth

00:09:21.677 --> 00:09:26.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
into a lie or into a misleading half-truth.

00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:30.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Peter 2:3 says:

00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:34.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They will greedily exploit you

00:09:34.023 --> 00:09:36.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
with counterfeit words.”

00:09:36.926 --> 00:09:38.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
A counterfeit is something

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:42.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s carefully designed
to look like the real thing.

00:09:42.098 --> 00:09:44.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take, for example, counterfeit money:

00:09:44.667 --> 00:09:46.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
It might look genuine,

00:09:46.702 --> 00:09:49.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s fake and thus worthless.

00:09:49.438 --> 00:09:53.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we’re deceived into accepting it,
we’ll lose money.

00:09:54.644 --> 00:09:59.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we’re deceived into accepting
the counterfeit words of apostates,

00:09:59.515 --> 00:10:02.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll lose our life.

00:10:03.753 --> 00:10:08.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
And apostates will give us
absolutely nothing of value in exchange.

00:10:09.625 --> 00:10:12.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine really needing

00:10:12.762 --> 00:10:15.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
a loving shepherding visit

00:10:15.231 --> 00:10:18.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
and asking apostates to give you one?

00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:22.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
Similarly, we must be careful

00:10:22.538 --> 00:10:25.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
about believing everything
presented in the media

00:10:25.741 --> 00:10:28.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
about Jehovah’s organization.

00:10:28.444 --> 00:10:33.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, the media is commonly motivated
by prejudice, hatred,

00:10:33.382 --> 00:10:35.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a desire for profit.

00:10:35.818 --> 00:10:39.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
False and exaggerated news reports

00:10:39.355 --> 00:10:42.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
are very common.

00:10:42.358 --> 00:10:44.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, in one European country,

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
many people were indignant
when an emotional press report stated

00:10:49.332 --> 00:10:51.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a young female Witness died

00:10:51.967 --> 00:10:56.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
because she refused a blood transfusion.

00:10:56.405 --> 00:10:58.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Were those the complete facts?

00:10:58.874 --> 00:11:00.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:11:00.543 --> 00:11:04.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
The patient refused a blood transfusion
on religious grounds,

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
but she did agree

00:11:06.682 --> 00:11:10.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
to alternative nonblood medical management.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
This could have been implemented immediately

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:16.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
and likely would have saved her life.

00:11:16.792 --> 00:11:18.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
However,

00:11:18.127 --> 00:11:22.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
the hospital delayed matters unnecessarily

00:11:22.498 --> 00:11:24.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
until it was too late.

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
The press report didn’t mention these facts.

00:11:30.373 --> 00:11:33.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
While it’s unreasonable to distrust

00:11:33.142 --> 00:11:36.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
all secular sources of information,

00:11:36.379 --> 00:11:38.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must be wary.

00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:41.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
First John 5:19 says:

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:44.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The whole world is lying

00:11:44.887 --> 00:11:47.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the power of the wicked one.”

00:11:49.825 --> 00:11:52.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s discuss a second example

00:11:52.628 --> 00:11:55.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the voice of our Fine Shepherd, Jesus.

00:11:55.464 --> 00:11:58.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew chapter 5,

00:11:58.667 --> 00:12:02.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 27 and 28, Jesus said:

00:12:03.472 --> 00:12:05.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You heard that it was said:

00:12:05.474 --> 00:12:08.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘You must not commit adultery.’

00:12:08.778 --> 00:12:13.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But I say to you that everyone
who keeps on looking at a woman

00:12:13.482 --> 00:12:15.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so as to have a passion for her

00:12:15.785 --> 00:12:20.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
has already committed adultery with her
in his heart.”

00:12:20.923 --> 00:12:23.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our Fine Shepherd is telling us

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only to avoid sexual immorality

00:12:26.962 --> 00:12:29.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also to flee from anything

00:12:29.031 --> 00:12:30.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
that could lead to it,

00:12:30.699 --> 00:12:33.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as immoral thoughts.

00:12:33.469 --> 00:12:38.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at Matthew 19:9,
our Fine Shepherd tells us:

00:12:38.774 --> 00:12:43.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I say to you that whoever divorces his wife,

00:12:43.479 --> 00:12:48.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
“except on the grounds of sexual immorality,
and marries another

00:12:48.484 --> 00:12:50.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
commits adultery.”

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here Jesus makes clear

00:12:53.122 --> 00:12:56.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the only valid basis
for divorce and remarriage

00:12:56.592 --> 00:12:58.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
in God’s eyes

00:12:58.594 --> 00:13:03.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
is if a disloyal mate
commits sexual immorality.

00:13:04.333 --> 00:13:08.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what’s the voice of strangers
of Satan’s world telling us

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:10.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding divorce, adultery,

00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:14.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other forms of sexual immorality?

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:18.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No problem.
It’s your choice.

00:13:18.581 --> 00:13:23.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have the freedom to do what you want.”

00:13:23.285 --> 00:13:28.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, in order to make sexual immorality
appear more innocent,

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:30.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s often euphemized.

00:13:30.926 --> 00:13:34.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sexual perversion, such as homosexuality,

00:13:34.663 --> 00:13:39.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
is called an alternative lifestyle.

00:13:39.702 --> 00:13:42.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
One so-called expert said

00:13:42.271 --> 00:13:45.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it’s simply like being left-handed!

00:13:45.608 --> 00:13:50.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pornography is called adult entertainment.

00:13:50.579 --> 00:13:54.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
Adulterous betrayal of one’s marriage mate

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:59.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
is called having an affair.

00:13:59.121 --> 00:14:02.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many call getting married old-fashioned

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:05.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see nothing wrong with living together

00:14:05.194 --> 00:14:07.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
without marriage.

00:14:07.396 --> 00:14:10.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this world’s media is very skillful

00:14:10.566 --> 00:14:15.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
at presenting something bad as good.

00:14:15.137 --> 00:14:19.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, in a movie,
a female character might be portrayed

00:14:19.341 --> 00:14:22.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
as having a husband who is abusive.

00:14:22.611 --> 00:14:26.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
You like the woman,
and you want her to find happiness.

00:14:26.782 --> 00:14:30.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then a handsome man
starts working in her office,

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s so nice to her.

00:14:33.556 --> 00:14:36.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s an attraction between them,

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:39.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the budding romance is presented

00:14:39.628 --> 00:14:41.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
as something good.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soft background music makes it hard

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
to consider her course to be bad.

00:14:48.704 --> 00:14:50.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s easy to keep watching

00:14:50.806 --> 00:14:53.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hope she leaves her marriage mate

00:14:53.976 --> 00:14:56.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
and runs off with her workmate.

00:14:56.779 --> 00:14:59.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
And usually that’s what happens.

00:14:59.848 --> 00:15:02.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
So easily we can forget

00:15:02.952 --> 00:15:05.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah and Jesus hate adultery

00:15:05.588 --> 00:15:07.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
and unscriptural divorce.

00:15:08.624 --> 00:15:13.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when we reject the voice of this world

00:15:13.062 --> 00:15:17.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
and listen to the voice of Jehovah and Jesus,

00:15:17.199 --> 00:15:20.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
we bring protection and blessings

00:15:20.436 --> 00:15:24.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
to ourselves and others.

00:15:24.206 --> 00:15:29.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now our third example
of the voice of our Fine Shepherd

00:15:29.078 --> 00:15:31.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
is at Matthew chapter 6,

00:15:31.981 --> 00:15:35.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to read verses 19 and 20:

00:15:36.518 --> 00:15:41.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Stop storing up for yourselves
treasures on the earth,

00:15:41.256 --> 00:15:44.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
“where moth and rust consume

00:15:44.026 --> 00:15:46.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and where thieves break in and steal.

00:15:46.762 --> 00:15:49.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Rather, store up for yourselves

00:15:49.732 --> 00:15:51.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
“treasures in heaven,

00:15:51.934 --> 00:15:55.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
“where neither moth nor rust consumes,

00:15:55.104 --> 00:15:59.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
and where thieves do not break in and steal.”

00:15:59.808 --> 00:16:01.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re told that our focus

00:16:02.511 --> 00:16:04.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
should be on spiritual things

00:16:04.513 --> 00:16:06.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not on physical things.

00:16:06.749 --> 00:16:08.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is especially true

00:16:08.951 --> 00:16:10.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
when thinking about where we are

00:16:10.953 --> 00:16:13.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the stream of time

00:16:13.155 --> 00:16:16.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
—in the final part of the final part

00:16:16.558 --> 00:16:18.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the last days.

00:16:18.961 --> 00:16:21.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what’s the voice of strangers

00:16:21.497 --> 00:16:24.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
of this world on this subject?

00:16:24.833 --> 00:16:29.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Exert yourself vigorously to acquire

00:16:29.104 --> 00:16:31.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
“material possessions.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Pursue things

00:16:33.375 --> 00:16:35.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that will make your life comfortable

00:16:35.711 --> 00:16:40.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
because that is
what will bring you happiness.”

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:45.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
The question is, To whom are we listening?

00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:49.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah and Jesus tell us to be content now

00:16:49.124 --> 00:16:51.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a spiritual paradise,

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
to concentrate on our lifesaving
preaching work,

00:16:55.164 --> 00:16:59.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that they will provide
a physical paradise later.

00:17:00.936 --> 00:17:03.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Peter 2:11 indicates

00:17:03.472 --> 00:17:05.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we should view ourselves

00:17:05.708 --> 00:17:08.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
as “temporary residents”

00:17:08.677 --> 00:17:11.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are just passing through this old system

00:17:11.213 --> 00:17:15.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
and headed for “the real life”
in the new world.

00:17:15.684 --> 00:17:19.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we mean by “temporary resident”?

00:17:19.655 --> 00:17:23.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, imagine that you rent
an old house to live in

00:17:23.058 --> 00:17:27.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
while a new beautiful house
is being built for you.

00:17:27.229 --> 00:17:30.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll live there only a few months.

00:17:30.165 --> 00:17:33.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you install a new concrete driveway?

00:17:33.769 --> 00:17:37.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you put in new electrical wiring
and plumbing?

00:17:37.873 --> 00:17:41.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you install brand new vinyl siding?

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:17:43.212 --> 00:17:48.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might do a few cosmetic things
to make your stay a little more comfortable,

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:50.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you wouldn’t do anything major.

00:17:50.619 --> 00:17:51.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:17:51.754 --> 00:17:56.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because you know you’re
just a temporary resident and that soon

00:17:56.759 --> 00:18:01.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll move into your beautiful new home.

00:18:01.196 --> 00:18:03.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if we think of ourselves

00:18:03.298 --> 00:18:07.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as temporary residents
in this old system,

00:18:07.035 --> 00:18:11.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’ll be a real protection
against the materialism

00:18:11.807 --> 00:18:16.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is promoted by the voice of strangers.

00:18:17.279 --> 00:18:20.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve now discussed three examples

00:18:20.249 --> 00:18:23.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jesus’ voice:

00:18:23.585 --> 00:18:28.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) Trust “the faithful and discreet slave.”

00:18:28.157 --> 00:18:31.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) Reject sexual immorality

00:18:31.627 --> 00:18:34.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
and unscriptural divorce.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:38.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
(3) Focus on storing up spiritual treasures

00:18:38.834 --> 00:18:41.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather than material treasures.

00:18:42.404 --> 00:18:46.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, there are many other examples
of these two different voices,

00:18:46.875 --> 00:18:49.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
but may we all be vigilant

00:18:49.678 --> 00:18:53.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
to listen to the right voice!

00:18:53.682 --> 00:18:57.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of Jesus, Jehovah himself said:

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:02.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is my Son, the beloved,
whom I have approved.

00:19:02.891 --> 00:19:06.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen to him.”

00:19:06.195 --> 00:19:11.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in order to do so obediently
as Jehovah’s sheep,

00:19:11.033 --> 00:19:15.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must reject the voice of strangers.

00:19:16.972 --> 00:19:19.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how would you handle things

00:19:19.274 --> 00:19:23.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
if “the voice of strangers”
was brought to you by someone close

00:19:23.779 --> 00:19:28.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a friend or perhaps even a family member?

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:30.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what Jade faces

00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:33.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the following dramatization.

00:19:33.689 --> 00:19:37.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
How will she learn to reject
the voice of strangers

00:19:37.526 --> 00:19:40.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a sensitive situation?

00:20:09.124 --> 00:20:10.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Amen.

00:20:10.359 --> 00:20:12.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
Smells wonderful.

00:20:12.995 --> 00:20:14.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, wait. I forgot.

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
You should cook every night.

00:20:17.466 --> 00:20:19.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you clean every night.

00:20:19.835 --> 00:20:23.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Uh, no, we’ll take it in turns.

00:20:23.872 --> 00:20:24.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ta-da!

00:20:24.873 --> 00:20:27.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this looks amazing!

00:20:27.743 --> 00:20:28.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:20:28.744 --> 00:20:31.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s practice for my first guest.

00:20:31.413 --> 00:20:32.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really? Who?

00:20:32.881 --> 00:20:34.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mum.

00:20:34.983 --> 00:20:36.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s wonderful!

00:20:36.585 --> 00:20:39.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had our first phone call in a year
that wasn’t a total disaster.

00:20:39.821 --> 00:20:42.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I invited her around tomorrow.

00:20:43.592 --> 00:20:45.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’ll go great.

00:21:10.385 --> 00:21:11.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi, Mum.

00:21:11.386 --> 00:21:13.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello, love.

00:21:13.355 --> 00:21:14.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come in.

00:21:15.557 --> 00:21:17.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nice to see you.

00:21:18.627 --> 00:21:19.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nice to see you too.

00:21:19.861 --> 00:21:20.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me take that.

00:21:20.929 --> 00:21:21.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, thanks, my love.

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:22.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s fine.

00:21:33.141 --> 00:21:36.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your roommates,
did you say they’re explorers?

00:21:37.612 --> 00:21:39.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pioneers

00:21:39.614 --> 00:21:41.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
—they preach full-time,

00:21:41.917 --> 00:21:43.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they work part-time.

00:21:44.886 --> 00:21:46.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm, I see.

00:21:46.088 --> 00:21:47.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you’re not?

00:21:47.289 --> 00:21:49.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, not yet anyway.

00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:55.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jade, love,

00:21:55.564 --> 00:21:57.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
all this,

00:21:57.566 --> 00:22:00.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see it’s made you a better person.

00:22:00.569 --> 00:22:02.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Heaven knows I tried.

00:22:04.406 --> 00:22:07.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I miss bits of the old Jade.

00:22:07.809 --> 00:22:10.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bits?
What, what bits?

00:22:10.812 --> 00:22:13.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where’s the Jade that questioned everything?

00:22:20.422 --> 00:22:23.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
So then she pulls out her phone
and starts showing me stuff about Witnesses.

00:22:23.959 --> 00:22:25.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
What kind of stuff?

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:29.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
News stories, all negative and slanted.

00:22:29.097 --> 00:22:32.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried to change the subject,
but she just kept at it.

00:22:32.768 --> 00:22:34.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
See you later, girls.

00:22:34.369 --> 00:22:35.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bye.

00:22:35.037 --> 00:22:36.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bye, Keesha.

00:22:36.038 --> 00:22:39.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sorry, I’ve got to get ready.

00:23:04.633 --> 00:23:06.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how long are you going to be gone for?

00:23:06.868 --> 00:23:08.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll stay another month.

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:12.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
I told my daughter it’s too hot here.

00:23:12.374 --> 00:23:14.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s happened to me?

00:23:15.477 --> 00:23:16.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abigay.

00:23:17.679 --> 00:23:19.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jade girl.
How are you?

00:23:20.482 --> 00:23:22.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Been better.

00:23:23.251 --> 00:23:25.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
Neeta said that your mother visited.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hope you don’t mind.

00:23:27.189 --> 00:23:28.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:30.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mum’s driving me mad.

00:23:30.158 --> 00:23:33.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s—it’s like it’s her hobby
to ruin my life.

00:23:33.562 --> 00:23:35.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh,

00:23:35.097 --> 00:23:37.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
she sounds wonderful,

00:23:37.165 --> 00:23:40.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
like me when my daughter got baptized.

00:23:40.836 --> 00:23:43.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
You opposed your daughter?

00:23:43.071 --> 00:23:45.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, mercy, yes.

00:23:45.207 --> 00:23:48.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love her so much.

00:23:48.577 --> 00:23:51.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I didn’t want to lose her.

00:23:51.046 --> 00:23:53.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I’m not going anywhere.

00:23:53.882 --> 00:23:57.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course not,
but a worried mother doesn’t know that.

00:23:58.286 --> 00:24:00.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mother, lunch is ready.

00:24:00.188 --> 00:24:02.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve got to go,

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:05.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I have a scripture for you.

00:24:05.727 --> 00:24:07.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you read it,

00:24:07.863 --> 00:24:11.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
remember your Mum is not the “stranger.”

00:24:13.568 --> 00:24:16.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
John 10:5:

00:24:20.942 --> 00:24:23.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They will by no means follow a stranger

00:24:23.945 --> 00:24:26.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but will flee from him,

00:24:26.481 --> 00:24:30.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they do not know
the voice of strangers.”

00:24:35.457 --> 00:24:37.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mum is not the “stranger.”

00:24:38.793 --> 00:24:40.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s what she shares.

00:24:45.834 --> 00:24:48.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Reject the voice,”

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:50.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
not her.

00:24:54.609 --> 00:24:57.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you look at those links that I sent you?

00:25:00.081 --> 00:25:02.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mum,

00:25:02.083 --> 00:25:04.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want us to get together,

00:25:04.352 --> 00:25:07.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I won’t hear anything negative
about my beliefs.

00:25:10.091 --> 00:25:12.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, perhaps we just won’t talk religion.

00:25:12.694 --> 00:25:14.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a deal then?

00:25:14.262 --> 00:25:15.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right then.

00:25:15.764 --> 00:25:17.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can see I’m not going to get anywhere.

00:25:17.165 --> 00:25:19.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what subject do you want to talk about?

00:25:24.472 --> 00:25:26.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
The deal fell apart

00:25:26.975 --> 00:25:28.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
—fast.

00:25:30.478 --> 00:25:33.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jade, I know
we weren’t going to talk religion,

00:25:33.682 --> 00:25:36.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I must tell you
this one thing that I read.

00:25:36.518 --> 00:25:39.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mum, I thought
we weren’t going to talk about this!

00:25:44.492 --> 00:25:46.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s getting late.

00:25:46.494 --> 00:25:48.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to go.

00:25:51.066 --> 00:25:53.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks for dinner.

00:25:53.068 --> 00:25:55.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll call you tomorrow.

00:26:12.387 --> 00:26:14.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jade, I got an alert this morning
that I really wanted—

00:26:14.756 --> 00:26:16.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mum, no.
I don’t—

00:26:17.492 --> 00:26:20.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was sure this wouldn’t work.

00:26:22.597 --> 00:26:25.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then it happened.

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:28.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jade, I’d like to change our agreement.

00:26:30.538 --> 00:26:32.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
If I ask you what you believe,

00:26:33.408 --> 00:26:35.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
you get to answer.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
Short answers
—I won’t be converting.

00:26:43.718 --> 00:26:45.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a deal then?

00:26:45.754 --> 00:26:47.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, it’s a deal.

00:26:58.366 --> 00:27:01.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
How wise it was for Jade to distinguish

00:27:01.936 --> 00:27:06.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
between the dangerous falsehoods
about Jehovah’s people

00:27:06.374 --> 00:27:10.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the person unwittingly promoting them!

00:27:10.178 --> 00:27:12.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jade took a clear stand,

00:27:12.647 --> 00:27:15.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
but she also patiently showed

00:27:15.183 --> 00:27:18.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
that she loved her mother.

00:27:18.219 --> 00:27:21.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
This not only protected Jade
from dangerous thinking

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:24.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also helped her mother.

00:27:24.726 --> 00:27:29.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, as our children grow
and attend school,

00:27:29.731 --> 00:27:32.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
many face a modern scourge:

00:27:32.767 --> 00:27:35.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
bullying.

00:27:35.103 --> 00:27:39.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can they overcome
the fear and negative feelings

00:27:39.107 --> 00:27:41.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
that being bullied causes?

00:27:41.876 --> 00:27:46.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll listen to two of our teenagers share
what worked for them

00:27:46.748 --> 00:27:50.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this edition of <i>My Teen Life.</i>

00:27:58.593 --> 00:27:59.994 line:10% position:50% align:center
My experience with bullying

00:27:59.994 --> 00:28:01.363 line:10% position:50% align:center
ultimately started

00:28:01.363 --> 00:28:03.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
in physical education

00:28:03.932 --> 00:28:08.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
when this kid who shared a locker
a few spaces away from me

00:28:08.169 --> 00:28:11.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
took that opportunity
and started to verbally attack me.

00:28:11.172 --> 00:28:14.209 line:10% position:50% align:center
I first experienced bullying

00:28:14.209 --> 00:28:16.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
in elementary school,

00:28:16.277 --> 00:28:19.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it was little stuff, nothing too big.

00:28:19.481 --> 00:28:23.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
In middle school is when
it was really, really something.

00:28:26.054 --> 00:28:28.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was upsetting that I

00:28:28.456 --> 00:28:30.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
was being bullied; it made me feel

00:28:30.959 --> 00:28:34.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
like I was doing something wrong.

00:28:34.329 --> 00:28:37.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why did I have to be the target?

00:28:37.232 --> 00:28:39.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
It got really personal.

00:28:39.033 --> 00:28:40.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
He would call me names.

00:28:40.335 --> 00:28:42.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
He would say that, you know,

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:44.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wasn’t good at anything, that no one
cared about me, that I was 

00:28:44.539 --> 00:28:45.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
dumb, that I was weak.

00:28:45.707 --> 00:28:47.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
Especially after he found out
that I was a Witness,

00:28:47.809 --> 00:28:49.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
the texts just got even more intense.

00:28:49.811 --> 00:28:52.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was one day specifically
that was really bad.

00:28:53.581 --> 00:28:55.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
It started in a classroom.

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:57.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
I heard one girl

00:28:57.385 --> 00:28:59.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
talk to another girl about me,

00:28:59.854 --> 00:29:02.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
right in front of me, and these were lies.

00:29:02.724 --> 00:29:04.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
We went to lunch, and I was cornered again.

00:29:05.427 --> 00:29:07.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Is this how middle school is going to be?

00:29:08.163 --> 00:29:10.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I don’t have anybody to be with,

00:29:10.999 --> 00:29:14.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
to hang out with during school,
because everybody doesn’t like me.’

00:29:14.769 --> 00:29:16.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt no one liked me.

00:29:16.738 --> 00:29:18.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the worst day ever.

00:29:18.406 --> 00:29:22.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
I no longer felt
that I was valuable at that point.

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:25.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was starting to feel more that I was

00:29:25.346 --> 00:29:28.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
this weak person, that I was

00:29:28.216 --> 00:29:30.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
defenseless, that no one cared about me,

00:29:30.518 --> 00:29:32.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that I was worthless to anybody.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:36.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
So hearing that over and over
really took a toll 

00:29:36.224 --> 00:29:37.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
on my mental health and my emotional health.

00:29:37.892 --> 00:29:40.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think at my lowest point,
after receiving so many

00:29:40.161 --> 00:29:42.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
of these vicious attacks,
I started to have really,

00:29:42.931 --> 00:29:44.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
really dark feelings.

00:29:44.265 --> 00:29:48.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I realized that I shouldn’t let this go
any further than it already had.

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:50.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the moment
when I knew I had to get help.

00:29:50.839 --> 00:29:53.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
I told my parents about it, of course.

00:29:53.241 --> 00:29:57.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
And especially on the worst day,
I told them everything.

00:29:57.412 --> 00:29:59.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
My parents always brought up scriptures

00:29:59.981 --> 00:30:01.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Proverbs 27:12.

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:04.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anytime I saw the bullies,

00:30:04.152 --> 00:30:06.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would avoid them as much as possible.

00:30:06.154 --> 00:30:08.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another thing that I was always doing

00:30:08.223 --> 00:30:11.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
was praying constantly
—always praying—

00:30:11.826 --> 00:30:15.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
before school, during school, after school.

00:30:15.296 --> 00:30:17.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were times
that I would go into the library

00:30:17.832 --> 00:30:20.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
and just read books, just stay to myself.

00:30:21.936 --> 00:30:24.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
During those times, I would also pray

00:30:24.005 --> 00:30:26.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah, and he was a Friend to me.

00:30:26.341 --> 00:30:27.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was Somebody that I could speak to

00:30:27.976 --> 00:30:29.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
on this matter.

00:30:29.677 --> 00:30:31.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
I did end up talking to my parents about it.

00:30:31.746 --> 00:30:33.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
They let me get my side of the story out.

00:30:33.848 --> 00:30:35.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were listening,
and they wanted to help out.

00:30:35.884 --> 00:30:37.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they made me feel loved.

00:30:39.921 --> 00:30:43.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
I definitely took this time
to reach out to the elders.

00:30:44.759 --> 00:30:48.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they really encouraged me and assured me

00:30:48.463 --> 00:30:50.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I was not only somewhere
where I was needed

00:30:50.231 --> 00:30:52.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that I was also somewhere
where I was wanted.

00:30:52.367 --> 00:30:53.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
I took some practical steps.

00:30:53.868 --> 00:30:57.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
I moved my locker;
I made sure not to retaliate.

00:31:00.508 --> 00:31:02.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
Walking away is something very powerful.

00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:04.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
Retaliation is something that’s weak

00:31:04.546 --> 00:31:07.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you’re giving in to your emotions,
and you’re just lashing out.

00:31:07.982 --> 00:31:10.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually, the bully got suspended,

00:31:10.752 --> 00:31:12.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
which gave me some peace.

00:31:12.787 --> 00:31:15.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
He ended up coming back after a week,

00:31:15.456 --> 00:31:17.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he started up again with the attack.

00:31:17.792 --> 00:31:21.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
I noticed that he hadn’t changed at all,
but I had.

00:31:21.062 --> 00:31:23.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was much more confident.

00:31:23.064 --> 00:31:25.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
With that change, I began to fear him less.

00:31:25.833 --> 00:31:26.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wasn’t scared of him.

00:31:26.901 --> 00:31:29.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just saw him as this person
who wanted attention from me.

00:31:29.837 --> 00:31:31.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
All the principles that you read

00:31:31.839 --> 00:31:34.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
about whether in “Young People Ask”
or scriptures that you pick out

00:31:34.676 --> 00:31:37.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
—everything really, really helps.

00:31:37.845 --> 00:31:39.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you can either see the situation

00:31:39.847 --> 00:31:41.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
die down or that it’s not that bad.

00:31:41.983 --> 00:31:45.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can deal with it, or it just stops.

00:31:45.653 --> 00:31:48.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was so encouraging for me,
and it helped strengthen

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:53.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
my faith in seeing how Jehovah
really is there to help.

00:31:53.461 --> 00:31:54.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t keep this to yourself.

00:31:54.562 --> 00:31:57.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t bottle it up,
because that’ll make things worse.

00:31:57.665 --> 00:32:02.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a problem that won’t go away
because you ignore it.

00:32:02.337 --> 00:32:03.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
You need to talk to someone.

00:32:03.871 --> 00:32:06.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Talk to your parents, talk to your friend,

00:32:06.207 --> 00:32:07.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
talk to Jehovah, talk to someone
in the congregation.

00:32:08.676 --> 00:32:11.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because if you don’t know what to do,
they’ll help you find out

00:32:11.412 --> 00:32:13.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
what to do and they’ll give you guidance.

00:32:13.514 --> 00:32:16.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you’ll be so impressed
by how much Jehovah takes care of you,

00:32:16.951 --> 00:32:19.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’ll show you that you are loved by him.

00:32:39.674 --> 00:32:43.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are loved by Jehovah.

00:32:43.444 --> 00:32:46.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if you’re suffering
at the hands of a bully,

00:32:46.648 --> 00:32:48.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t bottle it up.

00:32:48.716 --> 00:32:50.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are not alone.

00:32:50.918 --> 00:32:52.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Talk to your parents.

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:55.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
It won’t go away if you ignore it.

00:32:55.556 --> 00:32:59.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah can help you face up to bullies,

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:02.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you can trust Bible principles

00:33:02.597 --> 00:33:05.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they always work.

00:33:05.667 --> 00:33:09.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they work across a wide range
of challenges.

00:33:09.937 --> 00:33:13.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our next video, see how three brothers

00:33:13.107 --> 00:33:18.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
learned to trust completely
in Jehovah and his righteous principles

00:33:18.012 --> 00:33:21.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
when confronted with persecution,

00:33:21.649 --> 00:33:23.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
immoral influences,

00:33:23.951 --> 00:33:26.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the snare of pride.

00:33:27.922 --> 00:33:30.124 line:10% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 3:5, 6

00:33:30.124 --> 00:33:32.260 line:10% position:50% align:center
made a tremendous impression on me:

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:36.798 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Trust in Jehovah with all your heart.”

00:33:36.798 --> 00:33:39.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was younger, I probably said:

00:33:39.233 --> 00:33:41.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All right.
Let me try it and see if it works.”

00:33:42.704 --> 00:33:44.205 line:10% position:50% align:center
As much as I loved

00:33:44.205 --> 00:33:45.940 line:10% position:50% align:center
what I was learning from Jehovah,

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:47.341 line:10% position:50% align:center
I was still leaning a lot

00:33:47.341 --> 00:33:49.677 line:10% position:50% align:center
on my own understanding.

00:33:50.478 --> 00:33:51.813 line:10% position:50% align:center
Obviously, when we make

00:33:51.813 --> 00:33:53.381 line:10% position:50% align:center
decisions in our lives—

00:33:53.381 --> 00:33:54.482 line:10% position:50% align:center
A spiritual person

00:33:54.482 --> 00:33:56.584 line:10% position:50% align:center
will review and think,

00:33:56.584 --> 00:33:58.386 line:10% position:50% align:center
‘Let’s do this Jehovah’s way.’

00:33:58.386 --> 00:34:00.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that was something
that I had lost sight of

00:34:00.855 --> 00:34:02.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
at that moment in my life.

00:34:06.694 --> 00:34:10.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was considerable opposition
to the work.

00:34:10.198 --> 00:34:14.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
We expected that when we did street work,

00:34:14.168 --> 00:34:18.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might be picked up and taken to jail.

00:34:18.039 --> 00:34:22.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah’s organization
had explained to us

00:34:22.577 --> 00:34:24.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
how we were to handle it.

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:29.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
I do remember
when the police finally picked me up,

00:34:29.183 --> 00:34:31.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they drove me down to Chicago.

00:34:31.686 --> 00:34:34.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was about an hour’s drive,

00:34:34.021 --> 00:34:37.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they asked me,
“So, what did you do wrong?”

00:34:37.058 --> 00:34:39.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I had one hour to witness to them.

00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:43.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as I recall, I kept track of it,
and I counted the time too.

00:34:45.266 --> 00:34:47.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
Things didn’t disturb us

00:34:47.368 --> 00:34:50.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we were being trained
by Jehovah’s organization.

00:34:50.705 --> 00:34:52.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
We knew what to do.

00:34:53.508 --> 00:34:58.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I ended up in a jail
in Chicago for a weekend,

00:34:58.412 --> 00:35:02.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there was nothing I could do about it,

00:35:02.083 --> 00:35:04.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I put up with it.

00:35:05.019 --> 00:35:07.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I was home for a day or two.

00:35:07.188 --> 00:35:10.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then I went back to my assignment,
and I kept on working.

00:35:10.057 --> 00:35:12.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
I left the rest in Jehovah’s hands,

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:15.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he handled it very nicely,

00:35:15.196 --> 00:35:19.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether we were in jail
or whether we were not.

00:35:23.771 --> 00:35:28.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually, I stumbled
upon the punk rock anarchist scene.

00:35:28.476 --> 00:35:33.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this really called out to me
because here I could be myself;

00:35:33.481 --> 00:35:35.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could establish my own standards.

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:37.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that scene eventually led me down

00:35:37.685 --> 00:35:40.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a very dark path of immorality,

00:35:40.755 --> 00:35:44.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
drug abuse, drunkenness,
and a lot of violence.

00:35:47.228 --> 00:35:48.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt lonely.

00:35:48.696 --> 00:35:50.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt betrayed.

00:35:50.298 --> 00:35:52.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt that nothing made sense.

00:35:54.769 --> 00:35:57.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember thinking back

00:35:57.004 --> 00:36:01.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
to when I was learning about Jehovah
and how simple things were.

00:36:02.243 --> 00:36:04.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
I decided to give Jehovah another shot.

00:36:05.646 --> 00:36:10.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reading Matthew 16:24 hit me really hard,

00:36:10.451 --> 00:36:12.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
where it says to ‘disown yourself,’

00:36:12.987 --> 00:36:16.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I knew that scripture,
but I still hadn’t really focused

00:36:16.324 --> 00:36:18.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
on what it meant for me.

00:36:19.527 --> 00:36:23.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew I had to let go
of certain parts of my personality

00:36:23.831 --> 00:36:26.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
and of my old lifestyle.

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:30.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d never really given Jehovah
a completely fair chance.

00:36:30.137 --> 00:36:33.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I started applying more fully
the principles I found,

00:36:33.441 --> 00:36:35.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I started trusting Jehovah more.

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:38.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very quickly things
started falling into place:

00:36:38.246 --> 00:36:40.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
the determination that I had to serve him,

00:36:40.248 --> 00:36:44.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
the changes that I needed to make
—changes that I never thought I could make.

00:36:49.457 --> 00:36:52.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt that spiritual progress was

00:36:52.526 --> 00:36:55.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
appointments and assignments.

00:36:55.363 --> 00:36:58.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think pride got the best of me there.

00:37:02.136 --> 00:37:04.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very shortly after we got
to the congregation in Brooklyn,

00:37:04.972 --> 00:37:08.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m out in service with the coordinator,

00:37:08.209 --> 00:37:10.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he says to me:

00:37:10.411 --> 00:37:14.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The letter came back,
and you weren’t recommended as a servant.

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:17.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you know what happened?”

00:37:18.352 --> 00:37:19.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I said,
“Well, you know,

00:37:19.987 --> 00:37:22.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think those brothers
have some problems over there.”

00:37:23.991 --> 00:37:26.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he said:
“Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:37:26.027 --> 00:37:28.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Stop for a second here.

00:37:28.062 --> 00:37:33.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You don’t need to tell me anything negative
about the brothers in that hall.

00:37:33.034 --> 00:37:35.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Focus on what you need to do,

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:38.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah
will take care of the rest of it.”

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:42.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
It really did feel like Jehovah
was just saying: ‘OK, stop.

00:37:42.743 --> 00:37:46.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right now you need to focus on you.’

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:48.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that really just allowed me to relax

00:37:48.916 --> 00:37:51.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
and focus on what
was really a lot more important

00:37:51.619 --> 00:37:55.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
than whether I had a certain position
in Jehovah’s organization.

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:58.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
The humility and the patience

00:37:58.759 --> 00:38:02.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the love and the adjustments
that I needed to make

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:05.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
—being a more obedient servant of Jehovah—

00:38:05.266 --> 00:38:07.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
those were the things that were so important

00:38:07.301 --> 00:38:10.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I had forgotten about for a while.

00:38:12.039 --> 00:38:15.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
All the time that I spent pursuing
my own interests

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:18.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
always led to disappointment.

00:38:18.112 --> 00:38:21.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now that I’ve learned about Jehovah

00:38:21.215 --> 00:38:23.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
and living by his principles,

00:38:23.484 --> 00:38:25.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have been having the time of my life.

00:38:25.653 --> 00:38:28.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
To know that Jehovah just simply wants

00:38:28.389 --> 00:38:30.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make me the best version of me

00:38:30.491 --> 00:38:33.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
and teach me to enhance my personality

00:38:33.761 --> 00:38:35.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to become better,

00:38:35.796 --> 00:38:38.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
that really endeared me to Jehovah.

00:38:39.266 --> 00:38:43.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah really cared about me enough

00:38:43.838 --> 00:38:46.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
to mold my thinking.

00:38:47.141 --> 00:38:49.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was kind of like my life
was back in focus,

00:38:49.844 --> 00:38:54.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was able to just relax
and serve Jehovah happily.

00:38:55.683 --> 00:39:00.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then, of course, the blessings
started really pouring in after that.

00:39:00.121 --> 00:39:03.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything I’ve done
connected with the truth,

00:39:03.824 --> 00:39:06.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have enjoyed every speck of it.

00:39:09.363 --> 00:39:12.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might have some great idea,
but

00:39:12.767 --> 00:39:15.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
I found out:
You do things Jehovah’s way

00:39:18.005 --> 00:39:20.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the end result is nothing but good.

00:39:24.445 --> 00:39:28.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t it wonderful that Jehovah cares so much

00:39:28.649 --> 00:39:32.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he takes the time to mold our thinking

00:39:32.386 --> 00:39:37.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
and help us be the best possible version
of ourselves?

00:39:38.259 --> 00:39:41.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what a life lesson from Brother Adams:

00:39:41.796 --> 00:39:45.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do things Jehovah’s way

00:39:45.099 --> 00:39:49.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the end result
[will be] nothing but good”!

00:39:51.205 --> 00:39:53.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
With success like that,

00:39:53.841 --> 00:39:56.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
why would we try any other way?

00:39:56.710 --> 00:40:00.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or as this month’s music video asks,

00:40:00.381 --> 00:40:03.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>To Whom Could I Go Away? </i>

00:40:03.551 --> 00:40:08.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
Enjoy this faith-strengthening original song.

00:40:30.611 --> 00:40:36.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have listened to Jesus
In these troublesome days.

00:40:36.884 --> 00:40:42.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
He lights up my path
As I hear and obey.

00:40:42.523 --> 00:40:48.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is the Fine Shepherd,
And he shows me the way.

00:40:48.395 --> 00:40:55.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
He guides ev’ry step,
Never leads me astray.

00:40:57.371 --> 00:41:08.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why should I ever listen
To voices in opposition,

00:41:08.916 --> 00:41:22.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who would make me stray
From the path I’m on today?

00:41:22.496 --> 00:41:29.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
To whom
could I go away?

00:41:29.003 --> 00:41:34.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where could I turn
in times of trouble?

00:41:34.742 --> 00:41:40.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
To whom
could I go away?

00:41:40.214 --> 00:41:46.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
The voice of the stranger
Leads only to danger.

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:54.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s Jesus’ words I hear
and obey.

00:42:08.809 --> 00:42:14.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m secure and contented
With my place in his care,

00:42:14.882 --> 00:42:20.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
Surrounded by love
In the faith that we share.

00:42:20.888 --> 00:42:26.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
I look to the future
That Jehovah provides.

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:33.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
His Son is my Savior
With sayings of life.

00:42:35.569 --> 00:42:47.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will never listen
To voices in opposition.

00:42:47.147 --> 00:43:00.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why would I ever stray
From the path I’m on today?

00:43:00.761 --> 00:43:07.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
To whom
could I go away?

00:43:07.635 --> 00:43:13.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where could I turn
in times of trouble?

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:18.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
To whom
could I go away?

00:43:18.479 --> 00:43:24.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
The voice of the stranger
Leads only to danger.

00:43:24.551 --> 00:43:33.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s Jesus’ words I hear
and obey.

00:43:35.696 --> 00:43:42.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
To whom
could I go away?

00:43:42.169 --> 00:43:47.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where could I turn
in times of trouble?

00:43:47.808 --> 00:43:53.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
To whom
could I go away?

00:43:53.047 --> 00:43:59.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
The voice of the stranger
Leads only to danger.

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:09.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s Jesus’ words
I hear and obey.

00:44:10.531 --> 00:44:16.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
To whom
could I go away?

00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:32.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never, never ever will I stray.

00:44:34.154 --> 00:44:37.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
Certainly, that’s how we all feel.

00:44:37.725 --> 00:44:40.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never do we want to stray

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:43.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
from “the great shepherd,” Jesus Christ,

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:48.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he leads us through the end
of this troubled system of things.

00:44:48.068 --> 00:44:50.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
May this song encourage us

00:44:50.437 --> 00:44:53.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stick close to Jehovah’s organization

00:44:53.941 --> 00:44:56.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter what befalls us.

00:44:58.145 --> 00:45:03.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
For imperfect humans,
unity rarely comes easily.

00:45:03.117 --> 00:45:05.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our following video, please note

00:45:05.786 --> 00:45:09.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
how the Governing Body has always worked

00:45:09.056 --> 00:45:11.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
to maintain unity

00:45:11.492 --> 00:45:15.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
in behalf of the worldwide brotherhood.

00:45:21.869 --> 00:45:24.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know I’ve had an illness,

00:45:24.605 --> 00:45:28.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I’m getting along all right.

00:45:30.511 --> 00:45:35.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s a little tumor here in the brain,

00:45:35.149 --> 00:45:37.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
which the doctors are treating.

00:45:38.952 --> 00:45:43.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
And whatever comes, one way or the other,

00:45:45.993 --> 00:45:50.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, it has been wonderful
to work with you all these years,

00:45:51.799 --> 00:45:54.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I enjoyed it tremendously.

00:45:54.768 --> 00:45:56.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’m very grateful to Jehovah

00:45:56.970 --> 00:46:00.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could come to this meeting

00:46:00.274 --> 00:46:01.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
and be with you.

00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:18.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like C. T. Russell before him,

00:46:18.025 --> 00:46:20.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr had an exceptional gift

00:46:20.461 --> 00:46:22.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
for organizing the Kingdom work.

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:25.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
That set the stage for the amazing growth

00:46:25.999 --> 00:46:28.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the organization experienced
during the closing decades

00:46:28.869 --> 00:46:31.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the 20th century.

00:46:31.472 --> 00:46:35.843 line:10% position:50% align:center
Nathan Knorr died on June 8, 1977.

00:46:35.843 --> 00:46:38.178 line:10% position:50% align:center
Note what Brother Albert Schroeder,

00:46:38.178 --> 00:46:39.880 line:10% position:50% align:center
a fellow member of the Governing Body,

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:41.682 line:10% position:50% align:center
wrote about him:

00:46:41.682 --> 00:46:44.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As the Society’s principal administrator,

00:46:44.384 --> 00:46:46.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
“there have come to be over 90 branches.

00:46:46.954 --> 00:46:48.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Brother Knorr has proved to be

00:46:48.956 --> 00:46:51.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the right theocratic entrepreneur

00:46:51.325 --> 00:46:53.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
for this period of Jehovah’s Kingdom work.”

00:46:56.330 --> 00:46:59.032 line:10% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr helped to clarify the role

00:46:59.032 --> 00:47:01.401 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the Governing Body and its committees.

00:47:01.401 --> 00:47:03.403 line:10% position:50% align:center
Headquarters representatives

00:47:03.403 --> 00:47:06.039 line:10% position:50% align:center
were sent out to various branches,

00:47:06.039 --> 00:47:08.342 line:10% position:50% align:center
branches were better organized,

00:47:08.342 --> 00:47:10.711 line:10% position:50% align:center
bodies of elders were appointed

00:47:10.711 --> 00:47:12.980 line:10% position:50% align:center
in various congregations,

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:15.549 line:10% position:50% align:center
training programs were instituted,

00:47:15.549 --> 00:47:17.584 line:10% position:50% align:center
and schools were established.

00:47:18.185 --> 00:47:19.686 line:10% position:50% align:center
Because of the organizational growth,

00:47:19.686 --> 00:47:21.421 line:10% position:50% align:center
the number of conventions

00:47:21.421 --> 00:47:22.923 line:10% position:50% align:center
being held worldwide

00:47:22.923 --> 00:47:25.058 line:10% position:50% align:center
now numbered into the hundreds,

00:47:25.058 --> 00:47:27.094 line:10% position:50% align:center
and the Governing Body members

00:47:27.094 --> 00:47:28.328 line:10% position:50% align:center
wanted to be present

00:47:28.328 --> 00:47:30.697 line:10% position:50% align:center
at as many of those conventions as possible.

00:47:31.164 --> 00:47:32.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:47:32.666 --> 00:47:35.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the 1969 “Peace on Earth”
International Convention,

00:47:35.502 --> 00:47:36.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
a Governing Body member

00:47:36.937 --> 00:47:38.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
would fly to the convention city

00:47:38.772 --> 00:47:40.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the opening day,

00:47:40.274 --> 00:47:43.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
catch a flight to another convention city,

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:45.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then return to the original city

00:47:45.712 --> 00:47:48.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he could speak on the closing day.

00:47:48.215 --> 00:47:50.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the 1970’s and 1980’s,

00:47:50.551 --> 00:47:52.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
many existing branches

00:47:52.052 --> 00:47:54.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
with printing and shipping capabilities

00:47:54.221 --> 00:47:56.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
needed to expand to ensure

00:47:56.523 --> 00:47:58.625 line:10% position:50% align:center
that the worldwide supply of spiritual food

00:47:58.625 --> 00:48:00.394 line:10% position:50% align:center
would flow uninterrupted

00:48:00.394 --> 00:48:03.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter what happened on the world scene.

00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:04.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times,

00:48:04.264 --> 00:48:06.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
there were more than 20 branch construction

00:48:06.567 --> 00:48:08.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
or expansion projects

00:48:08.135 --> 00:48:09.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
going on simultaneously.

00:48:09.736 --> 00:48:10.871 line:10% position:50% align:center
And the Governing Body

00:48:10.871 --> 00:48:12.906 line:10% position:50% align:center
was very interested in each one

00:48:12.906 --> 00:48:14.274 line:10% position:50% align:center
and eager to dedicate

00:48:14.274 --> 00:48:16.810 line:10% position:50% align:center
the new facilities once completed.

00:48:18.412 --> 00:48:22.649 line:10% position:50% align:center
For me, it was always very encouraging

00:48:22.649 --> 00:48:26.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have contact
with the brothers of the Governing Body,

00:48:26.253 --> 00:48:28.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see their great zeal

00:48:28.655 --> 00:48:30.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their loving interests

00:48:30.724 --> 00:48:34.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the brothers behind the Iron Curtain.

00:48:34.428 --> 00:48:36.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1977,

00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:39.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
something outstanding happened.

00:48:39.733 --> 00:48:42.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1977,

00:48:42.402 --> 00:48:44.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was possible

00:48:44.404 --> 00:48:47.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Brothers Jaracz, Franz, and Sydlik

00:48:47.975 --> 00:48:50.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
to visit the brothers in Poland.

00:48:50.811 --> 00:48:53.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that was the first time

00:48:53.146 --> 00:48:55.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the first time—

00:48:55.148 --> 00:48:57.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
that members of the Governing Body

00:48:57.684 --> 00:48:59.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
could visit the country

00:48:59.686 --> 00:49:01.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
behind the Iron Curtain.

00:49:01.688 --> 00:49:04.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
They spoke to many overseers,

00:49:04.257 --> 00:49:07.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
pioneers, and longtime Witnesses.

00:49:07.828 --> 00:49:11.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was, of course, a wonderful experience.

00:49:11.298 --> 00:49:13.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
One year after this visit,

00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:15.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Jaracz along with Brother Henschel

00:49:15.669 --> 00:49:18.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
were able to get an appointment
with government officials

00:49:18.672 --> 00:49:23.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
to promote a more tolerant attitude
of Jehovah’s organization

00:49:23.176 --> 00:49:25.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the work
that Jehovah’s Witnesses were doing

00:49:25.445 --> 00:49:28.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Eastern Europe and especially in Poland.

00:49:28.015 --> 00:49:30.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, mind you, this was all taking place

00:49:30.217 --> 00:49:32.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
some ten years prior

00:49:32.519 --> 00:49:35.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe.

00:49:36.056 --> 00:49:37.958 line:10% position:50% align:center
They took various steps

00:49:37.958 --> 00:49:40.027 line:10% position:50% align:center
to meet with the local brothers in person.

00:49:40.861 --> 00:49:42.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Brother Barry of the Governing Body

00:49:42.696 --> 00:49:45.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
had the opportunity to hold a secret meeting

00:49:45.065 --> 00:49:47.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the city of Leningrad with Brother Kose,

00:49:47.901 --> 00:49:50.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was responsible
for the activity in the territory.

00:49:50.537 --> 00:49:52.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Kose said that he received

00:49:52.539 --> 00:49:54.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
tremendous encouragement
from that discussion,

00:49:54.975 --> 00:49:57.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the conversation with Brother Barry.

00:49:58.679 --> 00:50:02.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was interesting
that it wasn’t until after that meeting

00:50:02.182 --> 00:50:04.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Brother Kose found out
that he had been talking

00:50:04.818 --> 00:50:06.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a member of the Governing Body.

00:50:08.221 --> 00:50:09.322 line:10% position:50% align:center
The brothers in Eastern Europe

00:50:09.322 --> 00:50:11.191 line:10% position:50% align:center
really needed help to resist

00:50:11.191 --> 00:50:13.026 line:10% position:50% align:center
decades of satanic efforts

00:50:13.026 --> 00:50:15.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
to destroy their faith in Jehovah

00:50:15.095 --> 00:50:19.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
and weaken the unity
and confidence in His organization.

00:50:19.099 --> 00:50:21.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
The members of the Governing Body

00:50:21.868 --> 00:50:24.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
showed very deep appreciation

00:50:24.604 --> 00:50:26.606 line:10% position:50% align:center
for the brothers

00:50:26.606 --> 00:50:29.376 line:10% position:50% align:center
who kept the communication

00:50:29.376 --> 00:50:31.511 line:10% position:50% align:center
with the brothers behind the Iron Curtain.

00:50:31.511 --> 00:50:33.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because you have to imagine

00:50:33.513 --> 00:50:36.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
that to get the spiritual food there,

00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:40.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
they had to be willing
to take a personal risk

00:50:40.921 --> 00:50:42.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
to visit

00:50:42.923 --> 00:50:46.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to bring the spiritual food
to the brothers there,

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:51.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just to the countries right close

00:50:51.064 --> 00:50:54.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
but down there to the brothers

00:50:54.134 --> 00:50:57.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
—down there to Siberia.

00:50:57.204 --> 00:51:00.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the second half of the 1980’s,

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:02.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Iron Curtain began to open up.

00:51:03.944 --> 00:51:06.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a sense of freedom in the air.

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:11.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers in Eastern Europe
could feel that freedom.

00:51:11.084 --> 00:51:13.520 line:10% position:50% align:center
As governments granted permission,

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:15.322 line:10% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body organized

00:51:15.322 --> 00:51:19.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
conventions in Eastern-bloc countries

00:51:19.059 --> 00:51:22.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
—for example, in Poland and Czechoslovakia.

00:51:23.163 --> 00:51:25.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when bans were lifted,

00:51:25.432 --> 00:51:27.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
the members of the Governing Body

00:51:27.667 --> 00:51:32.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
traveled many times
to all the countries that were possible

00:51:32.405 --> 00:51:34.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Poland, Hungary, Romania,

00:51:34.407 --> 00:51:36.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
Czechoslovakia, Russia, Ukraine,

00:51:36.877 --> 00:51:38.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to the Baltic States,

00:51:38.979 --> 00:51:42.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also to Belarus.

00:51:42.149 --> 00:51:44.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
In November 1989,

00:51:44.184 --> 00:51:46.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Berlin Wall came down.

00:51:46.186 --> 00:51:48.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this was a great turning point

00:51:48.188 --> 00:51:50.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the history of the 20th century.

00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:53.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it also meant greater freedom
for our brothers.

00:51:53.326 --> 00:51:55.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body really sprung into action.

00:51:55.796 --> 00:51:57.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
They wanted to go

00:51:57.097 --> 00:51:58.331 line:10% position:50% align:center
and accelerate the work there.

00:51:58.331 --> 00:52:00.333 line:10% position:50% align:center
So Brother Jaracz as well as other members

00:52:00.333 --> 00:52:01.368 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the Governing Body

00:52:01.368 --> 00:52:03.103 line:10% position:50% align:center
closely supervised the work.

00:52:03.103 --> 00:52:04.571 line:10% position:50% align:center
Therefore, the number of visits they made,

00:52:04.571 --> 00:52:06.573 line:10% position:50% align:center
well, just skyrocketed.

00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:09.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the fall of 1989,

00:52:09.209 --> 00:52:11.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers Milton Henschel and Theodore Jaracz

00:52:11.545 --> 00:52:13.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
had the unique opportunity of visiting

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brothers in the Soviet Union

00:52:15.782 --> 00:52:17.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the first time.

00:52:17.784 --> 00:52:20.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers really wanted
to study the situation on the ground.

00:52:22.489 --> 00:52:26.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
They met with all of the elders,
circuit overseers,

00:52:26.159 --> 00:52:29.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
district overseers,
and members of the Country Committee.

00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:34.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was like one big shepherding visit.

00:52:36.369 --> 00:52:40.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in Eastern Europe,
1991 was the stage

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:42.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
for three international conventions

00:52:42.976 --> 00:52:46.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the subject
“Lovers of Godly Freedom.”

00:52:46.012 --> 00:52:49.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, of course,
besides these international conventions,

00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:52.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
other open conventions

00:52:52.452 --> 00:52:56.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
(so not in secret, no, open conventions)

00:52:56.423 --> 00:52:58.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
were held for the first time

00:52:58.892 --> 00:53:01.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the former Soviet Union

00:53:01.127 --> 00:53:05.866 line:10% position:50% align:center
—in Estonia, in Russia, and in the Ukraine.

00:53:06.466 --> 00:53:08.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just imagine!

00:53:08.468 --> 00:53:11.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
After decades of such difficult persecution,

00:53:11.571 --> 00:53:14.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
we experienced the opportunity to be together

00:53:14.174 --> 00:53:16.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our worldwide brotherhood

00:53:16.409 --> 00:53:19.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to see the brothers
from the Governing Body.

00:53:19.746 --> 00:53:22.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was an unforgettable time.

00:53:22.349 --> 00:53:24.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the happiest of times.

00:53:25.385 --> 00:53:27.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was super!

00:53:27.554 --> 00:53:32.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
One outstanding convention
was held in Zagreb.

00:53:32.425 --> 00:53:37.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, it was a loving
and a courageous decision

00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:40.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Governing Body to go there

00:53:40.667 --> 00:53:43.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite the uncertainty

00:53:43.737 --> 00:53:47.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the political situation in the country

00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:51.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
and maybe (coming up) a civil war.

00:53:51.444 --> 00:53:55.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
This convention was the only public event

00:53:55.615 --> 00:53:58.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was allowed by the government

00:53:58.551 --> 00:53:59.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the city of Zagreb.

00:53:59.619 --> 00:54:02.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
All other public events

00:54:02.455 --> 00:54:04.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
were canceled,

00:54:04.124 --> 00:54:07.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the convention
of Jehovah’s Witnesses was not.

00:54:07.594 --> 00:54:09.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Policemen and soldiers

00:54:09.663 --> 00:54:13.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
assigned to keep security
and order in the stadium

00:54:13.066 --> 00:54:16.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
were astonished that Serbians, Croats,

00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:19.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
Slovenians, Montenegrins, and Bosnians

00:54:19.973 --> 00:54:24.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
were sitting together in peace and in unity.

00:54:25.812 --> 00:54:28.248 line:10% position:50% align:center
At those international conventions

00:54:28.248 --> 00:54:29.516 line:10% position:50% align:center
in Eastern Europe,

00:54:29.516 --> 00:54:33.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
members of the Governing Body
gave the final motivating talk.

00:54:33.286 --> 00:54:36.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
And those talks,
given less than five months

00:54:36.823 --> 00:54:39.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
after the thrill
of obtaining legal recognition

00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:42.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
for our work in the Soviet Union,

00:54:42.495 --> 00:54:44.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
strengthened and encouraged our brothers

00:54:44.764 --> 00:54:47.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
for trials they would face in the future.

00:54:48.335 --> 00:54:51.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s plain to see
that the Governing Body of years past

00:54:51.304 --> 00:54:52.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
expended themselves

00:54:52.906 --> 00:54:55.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “know well the appearance of [the] flock.”

00:54:55.475 --> 00:54:57.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
They poured themselves out

00:54:57.544 --> 00:54:58.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
“like a drink offering”

00:54:58.845 --> 00:55:01.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to “take good care of [the] sheep.”

00:55:01.715 --> 00:55:03.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same deep love

00:55:03.717 --> 00:55:05.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
and tender concern for you,

00:55:05.986 --> 00:55:08.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
the sheep of the Great Shepherd’s flock,

00:55:08.388 --> 00:55:10.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been evident throughout modern times

00:55:10.724 --> 00:55:12.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
right down to this day.

00:55:14.627 --> 00:55:17.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
What striking evidence of unity

00:55:17.897 --> 00:55:21.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
our conventions provide! 

00:55:21.201 --> 00:55:24.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
While the world around them
roiled with ethnic strife,

00:55:24.671 --> 00:55:27.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
hatred, and violence,

00:55:27.107 --> 00:55:30.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers enjoyed a peaceful convention

00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:34.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
that rightly impressed the authorities.

00:55:34.381 --> 00:55:37.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our faith in the fine shepherd and his Father

00:55:37.484 --> 00:55:40.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
surely is being rewarded now

00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:45.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will be even more abundantly rewarded
in the future.

00:55:46.526 --> 00:55:51.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps, like many,
you’re still talking about last year’s drama,

00:55:51.097 --> 00:55:54.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Daniel: A Lifetime of Faith.</i>

00:55:54.834 --> 00:55:58.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
What moving lessons
and awesome depictions

00:55:58.638 --> 00:56:02.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
of visions and events from his life!

00:56:02.042 --> 00:56:04.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you like to take a look
behind the scenes

00:56:04.844 --> 00:56:07.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see what went into making it?

00:56:07.247 --> 00:56:10.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s enjoy a tour of some of the work

00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:14.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
that helped bring this account to life.

00:56:27.033 --> 00:56:29.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible book of Daniel

00:56:29.102 --> 00:56:31.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
is filled with imagery,

00:56:31.638 --> 00:56:33.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
visions,

00:56:34.407 --> 00:56:36.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
and amazing scenery and architecture.

00:56:39.112 --> 00:56:40.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of it serves

00:56:40.246 --> 00:56:43.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
to teach readers about the times we live in now

00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:46.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how we can faithfully serve Jehovah.

00:56:46.553 --> 00:56:48.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
The team that made 

00:56:48.154 --> 00:56:50.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Daniel: A Lifetime of Faith</i>

00:56:50.623 --> 00:56:54.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
had to portray these amazing things on film.

00:56:54.194 --> 00:56:56.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did they do it?

00:56:58.298 --> 00:57:00.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
Early concept art

00:57:00.133 --> 00:57:02.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
was made to help in the development

00:57:02.535 --> 00:57:05.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the many visual effects scenes.

00:57:16.015 --> 00:57:18.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
The architecture and aesthetics of Babylon

00:57:18.952 --> 00:57:20.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
were quite different

00:57:20.653 --> 00:57:22.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
from what the Israelites were used to.

00:57:23.957 --> 00:57:26.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sets needed to be designed in a way

00:57:26.359 --> 00:57:29.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
that helped convey
what it was like to be captured

00:57:33.933 --> 00:57:35.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
and brought to a foreign land.

00:57:39.272 --> 00:57:41.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
The production design and sets

00:57:41.875 --> 00:57:46.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
and props departments built 360-degree sets,

00:57:46.012 --> 00:57:49.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
which made for an immersive environment.

00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:58.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of the other wise men are unable to make
the interpretation known to me.

00:57:59.893 --> 00:58:01.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you are able to do so.

00:58:12.739 --> 00:58:15.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many costumes and props

00:58:15.508 --> 00:58:17.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
were carefully handmade for the production.

00:58:22.215 --> 00:58:24.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
Spearheads were hand-forged.

00:58:28.721 --> 00:58:30.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of the filming was done

00:58:30.423 --> 00:58:33.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Mount Ebo Studios in Brewster, New York.

00:58:39.666 --> 00:58:42.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some additional scenes
were filmed in nearby locations

00:58:45.705 --> 00:58:47.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in Florida.

00:58:49.042 --> 00:58:50.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
You need to rest.

00:58:55.615 --> 00:58:57.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
Several miniature sets were built,

00:58:57.951 --> 00:58:59.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
including a ziggurat,

00:59:03.723 --> 00:59:06.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then actors were filmed
in front of a green screen

00:59:06.593 --> 00:59:09.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
and inserted into the final shots.

00:59:12.765 --> 00:59:16.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
As filming was completed,
scenes were edited together

00:59:17.403 --> 00:59:18.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the visual-effects team

00:59:18.905 --> 00:59:21.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
went to work on many specialized shots.

00:59:28.147 --> 00:59:31.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
Digital models of people and animals

00:59:31.251 --> 00:59:32.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
were animated and combined

00:59:32.619 --> 00:59:34.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
with footage of real environments

00:59:34.487 --> 00:59:36.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make scenes

00:59:36.122 --> 00:59:38.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would have been impossible to film otherwise.

00:59:39.926 --> 00:59:41.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:59:41.427 --> 00:59:43.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
a digital model was made of the immense image

00:59:43.963 --> 00:59:46.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
in King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream.

00:59:47.433 --> 00:59:49.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
The team researched the characteristics

00:59:49.769 --> 00:59:52.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the actual materials described
in the Scriptures,

00:59:52.972 --> 00:59:56.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as metals and rocks,

00:59:56.576 --> 00:59:58.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that when the image falls,

00:59:58.511 --> 01:00:01.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
it appears realistic and believable.

01:00:16.629 --> 01:00:19.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just look at the results of thousands of hours

01:00:19.899 --> 01:00:22.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
spent modeling,

01:00:22.201 --> 01:00:25.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
animating, simulating,

01:00:25.204 --> 01:00:28.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
rendering, and compositing!

01:00:44.691 --> 01:00:48.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Music and sound effects add the final touches.

01:01:01.307 --> 01:01:02.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What do you see?”

01:01:03.543 --> 01:01:05.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah asked the prophet Amos.

01:01:08.381 --> 01:01:11.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
What Amos saw taught him important lessons.

01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:18.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the drama <i>Daniel: A Lifetime of Faith,</i>

01:01:19.492 --> 01:01:21.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
what did you see?

01:01:24.731 --> 01:01:28.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
And more important, what did you learn?

01:01:32.839 --> 01:01:34.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did you see?

01:01:34.907 --> 01:01:37.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hours of hard work?

01:01:37.377 --> 01:01:40.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dramatic visual effects?

01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:44.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bible characters brought to life on-screen?

01:01:44.417 --> 01:01:48.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t it amazing how they all combine

01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:50.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make what happened
thousands of years ago

01:01:50.857 --> 01:01:55.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
seem so real, so vivid,
and so faith-strengthening?

01:01:56.329 --> 01:02:00.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s enjoy this month’s postcard

01:02:00.133 --> 01:02:04.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
as together we climb
the peaks of Switzerland.

01:02:05.838 --> 01:02:09.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
About 70 percent of Switzerland

01:02:09.075 --> 01:02:11.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
is covered by mountains.

01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:17.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
Its tallest mountain rises to 4,634 meters,

01:02:17.116 --> 01:02:21.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
or over 15,000 feet, above sea level.

01:02:21.888 --> 01:02:26.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
Switzerland has
four official languages: German,

01:02:26.826 --> 01:02:30.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
French, Italian, and Romansh,

01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:35.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
a descendant language of the Latin
spoken in the Roman Empire.

01:02:35.635 --> 01:02:38.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
Switzerland has beautiful waterfalls,

01:02:38.838 --> 01:02:41.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
glaciers, lakes,

01:02:41.474 --> 01:02:43.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
rivers, streams,

01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:46.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
and alpine meadows.

01:02:46.412 --> 01:02:48.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cows graze these meadows,

01:02:48.981 --> 01:02:52.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
and from their milk, the Swiss make

01:02:52.018 --> 01:02:56.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
about 450 varieties of delicious cheese.

01:02:57.256 --> 01:03:00.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Switzerland is also well-known

01:03:00.259 --> 01:03:02.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
for another treat: chocolate.

01:03:02.762 --> 01:03:06.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, the Swiss consume
more chocolate per person

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:09.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
than people in any other country
in the world!

01:03:10.169 --> 01:03:14.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since Switzerland didn’t participate
in World War I,

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:18.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
it provided an ideal location to establish

01:03:18.678 --> 01:03:22.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
the first Central European branch office
of Jehovah’s Witnesses

01:03:22.615 --> 01:03:25.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the early 1920’s.

01:03:25.651 --> 01:03:29.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
During World War II,
Jehovah’s Witnesses from Switzerland

01:03:30.623 --> 01:03:34.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped to provide waters of truth
to other countries in Europe.

01:03:34.827 --> 01:03:38.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
At great effort and cost,
our brothers found ways

01:03:38.965 --> 01:03:42.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get spiritual food
to their brothers in Nazi Germany.

01:03:43.803 --> 01:03:48.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
After World War II,
our Swiss brothers generously donated

01:03:48.274 --> 01:03:52.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
food, clothing, and money
to support the brotherhood

01:03:52.245 --> 01:03:55.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
as part of the first
large-scale relief effort

01:03:55.982 --> 01:03:58.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our modern-day organization.

01:03:59.652 --> 01:04:03.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, over 19,000 Witnesses
across the country

01:04:03.823 --> 01:04:06.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
meet in 264 congregations

01:04:06.993 --> 01:04:08.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as in 39 groups

01:04:08.861 --> 01:04:11.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
or pregroups in 26 languages.

01:04:12.632 --> 01:04:16.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though a small percentage
of the population speaks Romansh,

01:04:16.369 --> 01:04:20.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
our fellow Witnesses make a concerted effort

01:04:20.706 --> 01:04:24.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reach them in the language of their heart.

01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:29.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
The 53 publishers in the Bever Congregation

01:04:29.181 --> 01:04:32.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
are busy spreading Kingdom truth.

01:04:32.952 --> 01:04:36.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Kingdom Hall in Bever
is located in the middle of the Alps

01:04:36.956 --> 01:04:41.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
at a height of some 1,700 meters,
or 5,500 feet,

01:04:41.494 --> 01:04:44.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
making it one of the highest Kingdom Halls

01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:46.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all of Europe.
