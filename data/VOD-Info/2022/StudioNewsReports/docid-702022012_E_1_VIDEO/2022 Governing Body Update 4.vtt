00:00:01.618 --> 00:00:04.120 line:10% position:50% align:center
Welcome, brothers and sisters!

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.556 line:10% position:50% align:center
It’s a pleasure to be with you.

00:00:06.556 --> 00:00:08.992 line:10% position:50% align:center
In this update, we’re going to share

00:00:08.992 --> 00:00:11.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
a few brief reports.

00:00:11.227 --> 00:00:15.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we’ll watch
a very encouraging video interview.

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:18.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure you’ll find it faith-strengthening.

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:21.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, here are the updates.

00:00:21.137 --> 00:00:23.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
In late April,

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Mark Sanderson traveled to Poland.

00:00:25.308 --> 00:00:29.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
A special meeting
was held at the Assembly Hall in Warsaw

00:00:29.713 --> 00:00:32.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
to encourage the brothers and sisters

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:36.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
affected by the ongoing war in Ukraine.

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:40.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over 250,000 from Poland,

00:00:40.023 --> 00:00:42.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ukraine, and the Donbas region

00:00:42.892 --> 00:00:44.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
tied in for the program.

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:49.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
One circuit overseer
in the Donbas region wrote:

00:00:49.365 --> 00:00:52.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[It was a] wonderful program

00:00:52.669 --> 00:00:55.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and ‘food [at the] proper time.’

00:00:55.205 --> 00:00:58.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It brings tears of joy 

00:00:58.074 --> 00:01:00.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see how Jehovah loves us!”

00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:02.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
After the program,

00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:05.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Sanderson
and three Branch Committee members

00:01:05.682 --> 00:01:09.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
traveled 2,500 kilometers,

00:01:09.252 --> 00:01:12.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
or 1,550 miles,

00:01:12.856 --> 00:01:15.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
throughout Poland to visit refugees

00:01:15.925 --> 00:01:19.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hardworking volunteers at Assembly Halls,

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kingdom Halls, and border crossings.

00:01:25.135 --> 00:01:28.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truly, this visit was a warm expression

00:01:28.138 --> 00:01:31.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s love for his people.

00:01:31.241 --> 00:01:35.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
We sincerely
thank all of you for your prayers

00:01:35.145 --> 00:01:40.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
and generous donations
that make the relief work possible.

00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:46.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
On May 4,
71-year-old Sister Valentina Baranovskaya

00:01:46.256 --> 00:01:48.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
was finally released from prison.

00:01:48.825 --> 00:01:51.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was imprisoned for well over a year.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a warm reception she received!

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:03.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
We rejoice with you, Sister Valentina!

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:06.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we’ve not forgotten that your son,

00:02:06.142 --> 00:02:09.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
Roman, is still in prison for his faith.

00:02:09.846 --> 00:02:12.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
We keep you both in our prayers.

00:02:13.783 --> 00:02:15.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
On May 24,

00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:20.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Dennis Christensen
was released from a prison in Russia.

00:02:20.323 --> 00:02:24.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
He spent five years
in various detention facilities.

00:02:24.527 --> 00:02:28.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
After his release,
he was immediately deported.

00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:30.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
He and his wife, Irina,

00:02:30.466 --> 00:02:33.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
are now safe in Denmark,

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:35.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we can see in the following video.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today is a happy day 

00:02:56.726 --> 00:02:59.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a happy day because I,

00:02:59.128 --> 00:03:02.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
at least I, got freed from the prison

00:03:02.031 --> 00:03:06.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I came home to Copenhagen, Denmark,

00:03:06.703 --> 00:03:11.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
where I can again be together
with my friends and my beloved family.

00:03:11.708 --> 00:03:15.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am also looking forward to living

00:03:15.211 --> 00:03:19.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
a more normal family life
with my beloved wife, Irina.

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m very glad,

00:03:21.584 --> 00:03:25.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I appreciate
all that the brothers and sisters

00:03:25.021 --> 00:03:29.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
have done for me in these five years.

00:03:29.525 --> 00:03:34.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
All these thoughts, all these letters,

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
all these prayers,
all the drawings and other gifts

00:03:38.368 --> 00:03:42.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I got from the children
have encouraged me a lot.

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
And through all this,

00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:48.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have always felt that I was not alone,

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:53.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah’s hand
was never too short to save,

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
to support, and to help.

00:03:55.184 --> 00:03:57.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many people ask me:

00:03:57.186 --> 00:04:01.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Oh, Dennis, has the prison time crushed you?

00:04:01.424 --> 00:04:03.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did they break you?”

00:04:03.092 --> 00:04:06.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
No way!
Never ever!

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:07.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you know what?

00:04:07.363 --> 00:04:12.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am more determined than ever
to be faithful to Jehovah,

00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:17.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
more determined to preach the good news,
to help other brothers and sisters

00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:20.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other people to gain their goals.

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:23.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
The goal is eternal life in Paradise,
where we all have the opportunity

00:04:23.947 --> 00:04:26.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
to serve and praise Jehovah forever.

00:04:26.616 --> 00:04:29.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, no, I’m not broken.

00:04:29.252 --> 00:04:30.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, I’m not crushed.

00:04:30.853 --> 00:04:32.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m still here.
I’m back!

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:37.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
We rejoice with you, Dennis and Irina!

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your faith and integrity
have strengthened all of us.

00:04:41.798 --> 00:04:43.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are overjoyed to have you back.

00:04:44.834 --> 00:04:47.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although we’re happy
about these developments,

00:04:47.737 --> 00:04:50.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
we keep in mind that around the world

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:54.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
over 150 of our brothers and sisters

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
are in prison for their faith.

00:04:57.647 --> 00:05:02.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Russia, four brothers
are serving eight-year prison sentences,

00:05:02.652 --> 00:05:07.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
and one sister
is serving a six-year sentence.

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:09.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hebrews 13:3 says: 

00:05:10.126 --> 00:05:13.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep in mind those in prison,

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:18.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
as though you were imprisoned with them.”

00:05:19.135 --> 00:05:22.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we keep
our imprisoned brothers and sisters in mind?

00:05:23.806 --> 00:05:25.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we live close by,

00:05:25.808 --> 00:05:29.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
there may be practical things
we can do to assist.

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:32.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
But all of us can pray for them

00:05:32.682 --> 00:05:36.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their family members every day.

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:40.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also can meditate on their fine example.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we see these brothers and sisters
endure unjust imprisonment

00:05:45.661 --> 00:05:47.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and do so with joy—

00:05:47.797 --> 00:05:51.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re encouraged to imitate their faith,

00:05:51.834 --> 00:05:56.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re motivated
to endure our own current trials,

00:05:56.506 --> 00:05:59.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re assured that we can endure

00:05:59.742 --> 00:06:03.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
future trials with joy.

00:06:03.312 --> 00:06:05.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following video interview,

00:06:05.848 --> 00:06:09.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
two brothers from Russia share how they

00:06:09.352 --> 00:06:11.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
faithfully and joyfully

00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:15.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
endured a four-year prison sentence.

00:06:17.126 --> 00:06:19.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
My criminal prosecution

00:06:19.128 --> 00:06:22.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
began on July 22, 2018.

00:06:22.965 --> 00:06:26.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a Sunday.
A meeting was in progress.

00:06:26.002 --> 00:06:28.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
After the search had finished,

00:06:28.938 --> 00:06:31.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
they told me that I had to go with them.

00:06:33.076 --> 00:06:36.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
I opened the door because FSB officers

00:06:36.212 --> 00:06:38.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
were persistently ringing the doorbell.

00:06:39.415 --> 00:06:44.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then after a few seconds
came the sound of smashing glass.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had smashed the balcony

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:49.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then had broken down
the door on the balcony.

00:06:50.026 --> 00:06:54.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when my wife had tried
to tell them the door was already open

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:58.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they wouldn’t smash anything,
pieces of glass cut her forehead.

00:06:58.568 --> 00:07:00.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
And a vein was—

00:07:02.405 --> 00:07:04.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
They cut a vein in her hand.

00:07:06.576 --> 00:07:11.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the officers approached me
and showed me the search warrant.

00:07:11.047 --> 00:07:13.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I said to them:

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:16.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’m not interested in the warrant.

00:07:16.385 --> 00:07:18.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
Call an ambulance!”

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:21.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to send my wife to the hospital,

00:07:21.424 --> 00:07:23.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
but she decided to stay with me.

00:07:24.827 --> 00:07:27.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
The search continued for five hours.

00:07:29.632 --> 00:07:31.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they locked me up.

00:07:31.934 --> 00:07:34.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two days later there was a court hearing

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
at which they ruled to place me under arrest

00:07:36.572 --> 00:07:39.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
and send me to a pretrial detention center.

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:50.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
The most difficult part
of all the persecution

00:07:50.186 --> 00:07:52.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
was being in the pressure cell.

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:55.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I entered, or rather,

00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:57.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the workers and guards
of the detention center

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
pushed me in there,

00:07:59.428 --> 00:08:02.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
the first thing I heard were the words,
“Get down on your knees!”

00:08:02.632 --> 00:08:07.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I told them that the only person
I bend down on my knees for was God.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then they started shouting, ridiculing me,

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
though I didn’t understand

00:08:16.812 --> 00:08:20.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
what they were asking of me
or what they wanted.

00:08:20.683 --> 00:08:23.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
I only found out after several hours

00:08:23.953 --> 00:08:28.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they told me directly
that I had to give them information

00:08:28.357 --> 00:08:32.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
about two brothers who had been
detained in a neighboring town.

00:08:33.129 --> 00:08:37.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
They laid out instruments
of torture in front of me

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
and said that I wouldn’t
be able to stand it or hold out,

00:08:43.172 --> 00:08:46.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I’d better agree to cooperate with them.

00:08:47.343 --> 00:08:50.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t give any evidence
against those brothers

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:55.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I knew it would
make their situation worse.

00:08:55.251 --> 00:08:57.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
I faced my own hardships

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I was put into pretrial detention.

00:09:02.425 --> 00:09:06.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every day from morning to night,
they had the radio on.

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:08.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
The radio was very loud in the cells.

00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:10.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
People were talking.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then after several months
in the detention center,

00:09:13.302 --> 00:09:15.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
they put me into a solitary-confinement cell.

00:09:15.338 --> 00:09:18.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was worried about who I would

00:09:18.674 --> 00:09:21.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
preach to if I had to spend
the whole period there.

00:09:21.944 --> 00:09:24.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
That evening I prayed very hard.

00:09:32.255 --> 00:09:37.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
A few days later,
a man was placed in the cell next to mine.

00:09:38.427 --> 00:09:41.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had been in prison for 13 years.

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:44.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the last year,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
he had begun to think deeply
about spiritual subjects

00:09:47.703 --> 00:09:50.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
and had even started to read the Bible.

00:09:50.172 --> 00:09:52.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
We often talked about spiritual matters

00:09:52.908 --> 00:09:54.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
—every day for several hours.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:58.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
I sang Kingdom songs to him
and read scriptures

00:09:58.614 --> 00:10:01.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the brothers and sisters
had sent me in letters.

00:10:02.118 --> 00:10:05.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of those who was in the pressure cell

00:10:05.921 --> 00:10:08.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
collaborated with the administration,

00:10:08.591 --> 00:10:11.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
and physically he was very strong

00:10:11.827 --> 00:10:14.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
—like a mountain of muscle.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:18.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
The thought came to me
that what was in front of me

00:10:18.834 --> 00:10:21.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
was actually 80 percent water.

00:10:23.806 --> 00:10:28.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know,
but maybe at that moment, I even smiled.

00:10:28.778 --> 00:10:32.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that thought,
which undoubtedly Jehovah gave me,

00:10:32.615 --> 00:10:36.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
at that moment
changed my view of those people.

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:42.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a cell next to mine
that was also a solitary-confinement cell,

00:10:42.658 --> 00:10:44.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it was often empty.

00:10:44.927 --> 00:10:48.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
Almost every day,
I prayed to Jehovah

00:10:48.664 --> 00:10:52.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
that my friend and brother, Vadim,

00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:54.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be transferred to that cell.

00:10:54.437 --> 00:10:56.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Vadim found out that I was making

00:10:56.505 --> 00:10:59.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
requests like that to Jehovah, he said:

00:10:59.141 --> 00:11:01.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Sergey!
You’re too naive!

00:11:01.711 --> 00:11:05.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You and I, in prison terms,
are ‘partners in crime.’

00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:08.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
So by law, we wouldn’t be allowed
to be in adjacent cells.”

00:11:09.985 --> 00:11:12.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said, “Let’s just wait and see.”

00:11:12.855 --> 00:11:16.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in the evening,
someone came into my cell and said,

00:11:16.892 --> 00:11:19.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Levchuk, you are being transferred!”

00:11:19.462 --> 00:11:23.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they took me out to a different block,
took me into a cell,

00:11:23.165 --> 00:11:26.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I heard Sergey’s voice
in the next cell through the wall, saying:

00:11:26.702 --> 00:11:28.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Vadim?
Is that you?”

00:11:28.904 --> 00:11:30.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said, “Yes, it’s me!”

00:11:30.973 --> 00:11:32.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he said: “Oh, that’s wonderful!

00:11:32.975 --> 00:11:34.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
I begged Jehovah for you!”

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:38.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when I heard that he had begged
for me to be moved to the next cell,

00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:42.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was quite angry
because my return visits had been messed up;

00:11:42.985 --> 00:11:45.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
we had agreed
that I would tell them a Bible story.

00:11:45.888 --> 00:11:49.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then I realized why Jehovah
had arranged things in that way,

00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:52.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we both needed
emotional support from each other.

00:11:52.995 --> 00:11:56.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we were together for two weeks.

00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:59.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
We read and discussed the text for each day,

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:01.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we shared thoughts from letters.

00:12:07.643 --> 00:12:11.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a situation
when I was depressed for several days

00:12:11.847 --> 00:12:14.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I was in the solitary-confinement cell.

00:12:14.417 --> 00:12:16.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I received a new package of letters.

00:12:16.619 --> 00:12:19.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
I usually sorted them
into those I would read first

00:12:19.688 --> 00:12:21.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
and those I would read later.

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:25.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was one letter
that I didn’t want to read at all,

00:12:25.094 --> 00:12:27.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I put it in a separate pile
for the future.

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then something inside said to me,

00:12:30.266 --> 00:12:32.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘No, you need to read that letter.’

00:12:32.935 --> 00:12:35.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that letter was the answer to my prayer.

00:12:35.671 --> 00:12:38.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
The main theme of this letter

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
is how Satan uses
one of his most effective weapons

00:12:42.645 --> 00:12:44.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
—discouragement.

00:12:45.781 --> 00:12:50.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started applying the counsel
on that subject straightaway,

00:12:50.085 --> 00:12:53.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that helped me
to come out of that state of mind

00:12:53.088 --> 00:12:55.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
and get rid of negative thoughts.

00:12:57.359 --> 00:13:02.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everywhere, I was having good discussions
with those in the neighboring cells.

00:13:03.265 --> 00:13:05.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were able to talk through the walls.

00:13:05.901 --> 00:13:10.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I kept asking myself
why I was constantly being moved around.

00:13:10.973 --> 00:13:13.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Couldn’t I just be left in one cell?’

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:17.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at that moment,
I received a letter

00:13:17.179 --> 00:13:19.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
in which a sister wrote the phrase,

00:13:20.916 --> 00:13:23.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you move from one cell to another,

00:13:23.285 --> 00:13:25.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
“view it as being
assigned to a new territory,

00:13:25.955 --> 00:13:28.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you have completed the previous one.”

00:13:28.023 --> 00:13:30.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had such a reaction to that!

00:13:30.092 --> 00:13:31.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said, “That’s the answer!”

00:13:33.128 --> 00:13:38.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
In their letters,
brothers and sisters from all over the world

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
sent various illustrations,
pictures, photographs.

00:13:42.671 --> 00:13:46.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
Someone sent this portrait, for example.

00:13:46.008 --> 00:13:50.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s my wife, Natasha,
and I sitting in Jehovah’s hands.

00:13:51.547 --> 00:13:54.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
All the spiritual food
we got was in the letters,

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:59.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the extent that even the entire
three-day convention was written out

00:13:59.555 --> 00:14:02.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sent to us in letters.

00:14:02.391 --> 00:14:04.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when I was reading the letters,

00:14:04.393 --> 00:14:08.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was as though I wasn’t there
in the detention center or the prison colony.

00:14:09.765 --> 00:14:13.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was with my friends,
as if being with them as guests,

00:14:13.736 --> 00:14:15.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I was reading their letters.

00:14:15.337 --> 00:14:19.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it was as though for half
of the three-and-a-half-year sentence,

00:14:19.074 --> 00:14:23.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wasn’t really there
in the detention center or the prison colony.

00:14:23.712 --> 00:14:28.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each day throughout
the entire time of my imprisonment,

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:32.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
each morning,
I would ask Jehovah for godly peace,

00:14:32.988 --> 00:14:35.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a sense of calm.

00:14:35.424 --> 00:14:39.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in circumstances like that,

00:14:39.228 --> 00:14:44.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
words just cannot express
how much you feel that calmness.

00:14:44.233 --> 00:14:48.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is totally opposite
to the circumstances you’re in,

00:14:48.604 --> 00:14:51.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
the company that surrounds you,

00:14:51.473 --> 00:14:54.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even your state of health.

00:14:54.243 --> 00:14:58.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to have peace of heart,
that’s a real sense of calm.

00:14:58.347 --> 00:15:01.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
As well as that,
I felt enormous support from the brothers

00:15:01.884 --> 00:15:05.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah’s love
during the court proceedings

00:15:06.488 --> 00:15:08.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
because there was always a large number

00:15:08.924 --> 00:15:11.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
of brothers and sisters
at the court hearings.

00:15:14.396 --> 00:15:15.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
For the first few times

00:15:15.931 --> 00:15:18.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
when brothers and sisters
came for the hearings

00:15:18.267 --> 00:15:19.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the measures of restriction,

00:15:19.868 --> 00:15:22.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
the FSB would write down their names

00:15:22.972 --> 00:15:26.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then hand them orders
to appear for interrogation.

00:15:27.376 --> 00:15:30.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we would arrive for the next hearing

00:15:30.145 --> 00:15:33.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see the same brothers and sisters there,

00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:35.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that really strengthened us.

00:15:35.618 --> 00:15:37.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
We saw that they were not afraid,

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:41.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that they sincerely wanted to support us.

00:15:41.023 --> 00:15:43.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that was how it was right to the end.

00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:53.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
In one letter,
I received the outline for the Memorial,

00:15:53.402 --> 00:15:56.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was very eager to give the talk.

00:15:58.273 --> 00:16:00.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just a few days later,

00:16:00.676 --> 00:16:03.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
while exercising in the prison yard,

00:16:03.879 --> 00:16:07.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started speaking with an inmate
who was interested in the Bible.

00:16:07.082 --> 00:16:09.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the day before the Memorial,

00:16:09.585 --> 00:16:12.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were talking again, 
and I said to him,

00:16:12.955 --> 00:16:15.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Did you know that tomorrow

00:16:15.024 --> 00:16:19.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
a celebration will be taking place
all over the world?”

00:16:19.028 --> 00:16:22.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
I explained to him what the celebration was,

00:16:22.564 --> 00:16:26.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
how it was going to be held,
and that there will be a talk given.

00:16:26.201 --> 00:16:29.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he said to me,
“Sergey, do you have this talk?”

00:16:29.538 --> 00:16:31.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said, “Yeah, I do!”

00:16:33.042 --> 00:16:35.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so we agreed that the next day,

00:16:35.444 --> 00:16:39.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the day of the Memorial,
I would give the talk.

00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:41.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so the day came.

00:16:41.483 --> 00:16:44.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was already ten o’clock in the evening,

00:16:44.987 --> 00:16:47.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the man was still busy with something.

00:16:47.956 --> 00:16:50.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
I prayed to Jehovah, “What shall I do?”

00:16:50.693 --> 00:16:52.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then at 10:30,

00:16:52.861 --> 00:16:56.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
he shouts to me:
“Sergey, you can begin!

00:16:56.665 --> 00:16:58.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re all listening to you carefully!”

00:16:58.734 --> 00:17:01.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that was how I began my presentation.

00:17:03.072 --> 00:17:05.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
Literally, a few minutes pass,

00:17:05.774 --> 00:17:08.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I hear footsteps in the corridor.

00:17:08.811 --> 00:17:11.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
The inspector comes to my door

00:17:11.146 --> 00:17:13.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
and looks through
the spyhole on the cell door.

00:17:16.485 --> 00:17:19.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
I ask him, “Did something happen?”

00:17:19.221 --> 00:17:21.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “Nothing, nothing!

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:24.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Continue reading!
Read!”

00:17:24.126 --> 00:17:27.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said: “Oh, Jehovah!
Thank you so much.”

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:29.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so I continued with the talk.

00:17:38.273 --> 00:17:41.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew that we would probably be separated

00:17:41.343 --> 00:17:44.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we could be assigned
to separate sections,

00:17:44.947 --> 00:17:49.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we wouldn’t have
the opportunity to support each other

00:17:49.318 --> 00:17:51.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
and conduct meetings,

00:17:51.453 --> 00:17:54.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was really important to me.

00:17:54.089 --> 00:17:56.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
He explained his position,

00:17:56.091 --> 00:18:00.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he needed to look after me
as I was disabled,

00:18:00.562 --> 00:18:03.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the administration made the concession.

00:18:03.132 --> 00:18:05.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was such a support

00:18:05.934 --> 00:18:09.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
—spiritually, emotionally, and physically.

00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:29.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
We conducted congregation meetings together.

00:18:31.426 --> 00:18:35.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each week at the same time,
we held the congregation meetings.

00:18:58.053 --> 00:19:02.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes others would join us
to listen to the talk.

00:19:13.335 --> 00:19:18.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Vadim and I always prayed
in full view of everyone;

00:19:19.174 --> 00:19:23.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was in the dining hall,
before meetings, after meetings,

00:19:23.545 --> 00:19:26.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
and before going to bed.

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:32.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a witness to the others,
and people took note of it.

00:19:33.856 --> 00:19:38.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
And because of that,
we were respected for being people of faith.

00:19:45.534 --> 00:19:49.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
I always knew that I had
to make special use of this time.

00:19:49.404 --> 00:19:51.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I prayed.

00:19:51.406 --> 00:19:54.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
The whole time,
I said a particular prayer to Jehovah.

00:19:54.776 --> 00:19:59.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said to him, “Jehovah, you are the Potter,
and I am the clay,

00:19:59.248 --> 00:20:01.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
so please mold me.”

00:20:02.918 --> 00:20:06.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the situations
that I found myself in throughout

00:20:06.188 --> 00:20:08.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
those three and a half years,

00:20:08.357 --> 00:20:10.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
both the good and the bad ones,

00:20:10.692 --> 00:20:13.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
were always opportunities to be molded.

00:20:13.595 --> 00:20:16.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
In going through all of those trials,

00:20:16.498 --> 00:20:20.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw and felt
that my relationship with Jehovah

00:20:20.636 --> 00:20:24.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
was getting stronger
—stronger and more trusting.

00:20:25.841 --> 00:20:30.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was because in those circumstances,
there was a lot of time for prayer.

00:20:30.779 --> 00:20:35.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I saw very often how Jehovah
answers specific prayers.

00:20:35.784 --> 00:20:38.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
That really drew me closer to Jehovah.

00:20:40.022 --> 00:20:42.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
Throughout the whole period of persecution,

00:20:42.824 --> 00:20:47.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was strengthened
by the words of Jeremiah 48:10:

00:20:47.229 --> 00:20:51.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Cursed is the one who carries out
the mission of Jehovah neglectfully!”

00:20:51.099 --> 00:20:55.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I found myself in such
hard and difficult circumstances,

00:20:55.103 --> 00:20:58.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
I understood that I had the responsibility

00:20:58.173 --> 00:21:00.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give a witness for Jehovah’s name

00:21:00.475 --> 00:21:02.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
by my conduct and deeds.

00:21:02.778 --> 00:21:07.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another thing that always
strengthened me throughout the whole time

00:21:07.149 --> 00:21:11.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the scripture at Isaiah 57:15

00:21:12.688 --> 00:21:16.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the thought that Jehovah
lives with those who are “crushed”

00:21:16.224 --> 00:21:18.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
and who are in a bad place emotionally.

00:21:20.829 --> 00:21:24.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
At such times, I was able to imagine
Jehovah sitting right next to me

00:21:24.866 --> 00:21:27.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
and stroking my shoulder

00:21:27.502 --> 00:21:30.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reassuring me: “Everything will be fine.

00:21:30.572 --> 00:21:33.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am with you.”

00:21:33.342 --> 00:21:37.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have seen that in all the trials
that have been allowed,

00:21:37.012 --> 00:21:39.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite their difficulty,

00:21:39.381 --> 00:21:42.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has turned them all into blessings.

00:22:07.242 --> 00:22:09.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a touching interview!

00:22:09.578 --> 00:22:11.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:16.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
what helped our brothers to joyfully
endure their unjust imprisonment?

00:22:16.451 --> 00:22:18.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
They mentioned how vital it was

00:22:18.954 --> 00:22:23.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep a good routine of Bible reading,

00:22:23.458 --> 00:22:28.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
prayer, and meetings
even though they were in prison.

00:22:28.463 --> 00:22:32.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
They witnessed
to others at every opportunity.

00:22:32.634 --> 00:22:37.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they saw Jehovah’s love and care
in very personal ways.

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:41.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can do these same things
to strengthen our faith

00:22:41.777 --> 00:22:44.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
and maintain our joy.

00:22:44.413 --> 00:22:46.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
Speaking of joy,

00:22:46.415 --> 00:22:49.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
what a blessing it has been for us

00:22:49.084 --> 00:22:52.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
to return to in-person meetings!

00:22:52.421 --> 00:22:55.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
It takes some effort to attend,

00:22:55.157 --> 00:22:57.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
but seeing our brothers and sisters,

00:22:57.926 --> 00:22:59.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
hearing their laughter,

00:22:59.928 --> 00:23:03.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
and joining with them in song and prayer

00:23:03.598 --> 00:23:06.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
makes the effort so worthwhile!

00:23:08.103 --> 00:23:12.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s another gift from Jehovah
to help us joyfully endure.

00:23:13.809 --> 00:23:16.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
So whatever trials you’re dealing with,

00:23:16.711 --> 00:23:21.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t lose your joy in serving Jehovah.

00:23:21.149 --> 00:23:23.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Nehemiah 8:10 says:

00:23:23.151 --> 00:23:25.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not feel sad,

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:29.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.”

00:23:29.925 --> 00:23:32.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters,

00:23:32.427 --> 00:23:36.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
we appreciate you
and the joy that you maintain

00:23:36.298 --> 00:23:40.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite the many challenges we face.

00:23:40.001 --> 00:23:42.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
It makes us love you all the more.

00:23:44.272 --> 00:23:47.642 line:90% position:50% align:center

of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
