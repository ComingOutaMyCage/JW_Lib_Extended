00:00:02.218 --> 00:00:05.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters, welcome to this update.

00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:08.625 line:10% position:50% align:center
No doubt, we’re all still thinking

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:10.560 line:10% position:50% align:center
about the Memorial of Christ’s death

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.062 line:10% position:50% align:center
and the great love

00:00:12.062 --> 00:00:14.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah and Jesus have shown.

00:00:14.464 --> 00:00:17.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was so good that many of us

00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:19.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
were able to be together in person

00:00:19.736 --> 00:00:22.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
for this most important occasion of the year.

00:00:22.906 --> 00:00:25.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
Were you excited when you heard

00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:28.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we would resume
in-person meetings worldwide

00:00:28.478 --> 00:00:30.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
on April 1?

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body
really felt Jehovah’s direction

00:00:33.583 --> 00:00:37.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
when making that decision,
and we were excited to share it.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
Less than two hours after our meeting,

00:00:40.423 --> 00:00:43.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Breaking News was posted.

00:00:43.226 --> 00:00:46.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likely, you can identify with the feelings

00:00:46.663 --> 00:00:49.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our brothers and sisters
in the following video.

00:01:37.514 --> 00:01:39.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
Going back to the Kingdom Hall,

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s wonderful seeing
the brothers and sisters,

00:01:41.885 --> 00:01:44.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
hugging them; it’s emotional.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, Jehovah knows what we need.

00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:16.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel very excited.

00:02:16.085 --> 00:02:19.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m happy to be here,
hearing everybody’s comments.

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:22.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, my stomach was in knots this morning,

00:02:22.358 --> 00:02:26.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
but right now, I’m really excited
and happy that we’re all here.

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:28.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
For Jehovah’s people to get back

00:02:28.798 --> 00:02:32.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
to worshipping together at meetings

00:02:32.602 --> 00:02:34.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
—talk about a spiritual paradise.

00:03:46.376 --> 00:03:48.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seeing one another face-to-face

00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:51.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
(or, more accurately, “mask-to-mask”)

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:54.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
after so long was wonderful!

00:03:54.584 --> 00:03:57.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Singing together, praying together,

00:03:57.687 --> 00:03:59.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
meeting new ones in person

00:03:59.956 --> 00:04:02.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all of this is so refreshing.

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
One seven-year-old girl said:

00:04:05.628 --> 00:04:08.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have never been more patient in my life

00:04:08.731 --> 00:04:13.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
than waiting to go back
to the Kingdom Hall for two years.”

00:04:13.636 --> 00:04:17.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our return to the Kingdom Hall
has been possible

00:04:17.707 --> 00:04:22.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
because in many ways
we’re in another phase of the pandemic.

00:04:22.612 --> 00:04:26.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now that there is a high rate of vaccination

00:04:26.115 --> 00:04:28.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
and new treatments are becoming available,

00:04:28.618 --> 00:04:31.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
many governments have relaxed restrictions.

00:04:31.921 --> 00:04:34.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
In various parts of the world,

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
life is somewhat returning to normal.

00:04:37.593 --> 00:04:39.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does it mean?

00:04:39.996 --> 00:04:43.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re all learning to live with COVID-19

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:46.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
while still taking reasonable precautions.

00:04:46.736 --> 00:04:49.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
In time, we look forward to being able

00:04:49.305 --> 00:04:53.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
to resume additional theocratic activities.

00:04:53.343 --> 00:04:56.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, for the rest of our update,

00:04:56.646 --> 00:05:01.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to talk about
the situation in Ukraine and Russia.

00:05:01.484 --> 00:05:05.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
How are our brothers and sisters
in those countries doing?

00:05:05.855 --> 00:05:08.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we cope with any anxiety

00:05:08.691 --> 00:05:12.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may feel about the situation?

00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:15.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure we’ve all appreciated

00:05:15.098 --> 00:05:18.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
the timely updates on jw.org.

00:05:18.067 --> 00:05:21.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers and sisters in Eastern Europe

00:05:21.304 --> 00:05:23.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
have had a wonderful share in the ministry

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:26.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite war and the pandemic.

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:30.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are deeply touched
by their godly devotion.

00:05:30.446 --> 00:05:34.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
The branch office in Ukraine is functioning

00:05:34.217 --> 00:05:38.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
and actively assisting
tens of thousands of refugees.

00:05:39.555 --> 00:05:44.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
The branch reports
that as of Monday, April 18,

00:05:44.193 --> 00:05:48.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
over 42,000
of our brothers and sisters in Ukraine

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:50.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been displaced.

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:56.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
Close to 19,000
have chosen to flee to other countries.

00:05:56.105 --> 00:05:58.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are deeply saddened to report

00:05:58.875 --> 00:06:03.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
that 32 brothers and sisters have died.

00:06:03.413 --> 00:06:07.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
How should we view this situation?

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recall Jesus’ words
when he described the sign of his presence,

00:06:12.188 --> 00:06:14.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded at Matthew 24:6.

00:06:14.957 --> 00:06:16.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said:

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:18.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You are going to hear

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:22.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
of wars and reports of wars.”

00:06:22.432 --> 00:06:25.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some Bible scholars say that this means

00:06:25.735 --> 00:06:30.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
wars that are nearby
and wars that are in distant places.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
One translation says:

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:36.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You are going to hear
the noise of battles close by

00:06:36.946 --> 00:06:40.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the news of battles far away.”

00:06:40.283 --> 00:06:42.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s true today.

00:06:42.718 --> 00:06:46.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of us are hearing
the sounds of war nearby;

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:51.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
others are hearing of wars in distant lands.

00:06:51.294 --> 00:06:53.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
These news reports

00:06:53.396 --> 00:06:57.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
often involve graphic pictures of bloodshed.

00:06:57.033 --> 00:07:00.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, it seems like we’re right there

00:07:00.636 --> 00:07:02.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the middle of the battle.

00:07:02.705 --> 00:07:05.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, we see and hear reports

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:08.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
of how our brothers are affected.

00:07:08.111 --> 00:07:10.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do you feel?

00:07:10.113 --> 00:07:12.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
Overwhelmed?

00:07:12.115 --> 00:07:14.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shocked?

00:07:14.117 --> 00:07:16.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Angry?

00:07:16.119 --> 00:07:18.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
Traumatized?

00:07:18.121 --> 00:07:21.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
We feel the pain of our brothers and sisters.

00:07:21.424 --> 00:07:24.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, we may even ask:

00:07:24.994 --> 00:07:27.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why does Jehovah allow this?’

00:07:27.797 --> 00:07:30.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s only natural to feel that way.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we need to be careful.

00:07:33.503 --> 00:07:35.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Jesus say?

00:07:35.771 --> 00:07:39.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
The rest of Matthew 24:6 says:

00:07:39.342 --> 00:07:42.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
“See that you are not alarmed,

00:07:42.478 --> 00:07:45.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for these things must take place,

00:07:45.348 --> 00:07:47.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the end is not yet.”

00:07:48.818 --> 00:07:53.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Do not be alarmed’ or,
as another translation says:

00:07:53.656 --> 00:07:56.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Take care not to be scared
out of your wits.”

00:07:56.959 --> 00:07:59.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
And another says:

00:07:59.195 --> 00:08:03.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be sure that you don’t get upset.”

00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:07.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will help us not to be alarmed?

00:08:07.236 --> 00:08:10.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here are four points:

00:08:10.273 --> 00:08:14.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, remember why Jehovah

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:17.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
permits our brothers to be affected by war.

00:08:17.213 --> 00:08:19.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of Job’s example.

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:24.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Job 1:10, Satan complained to Jehovah:

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:27.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Have you not put up a protective hedge

00:08:27.723 --> 00:08:31.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
around him and his house
and everything he has?”

00:08:32.562 --> 00:08:34.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan claimed that Job

00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:36.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and by extension all humans—

00:08:36.999 --> 00:08:40.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
serve Jehovah only for selfish reasons.

00:08:40.736 --> 00:08:43.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah allowed Job to lose everything,

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
and yet Job kept his integrity

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:49.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
and proved Satan a liar!

00:08:49.145 --> 00:08:51.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same is true today.

00:08:51.814 --> 00:08:55.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of our dear brothers and sisters
have lost everything

00:08:55.918 --> 00:08:58.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
—their homes, their possessions,

00:08:58.287 --> 00:09:01.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
their jobs, and even their loved ones—

00:09:01.257 --> 00:09:03.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they have fled the conflict.

00:09:03.826 --> 00:09:05.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as our brothers and sisters

00:09:05.828 --> 00:09:09.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
remain loyal to Jehovah
despite war and other hardships,

00:09:09.865 --> 00:09:13.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
they give a loud reply to Satan’s taunts

00:09:13.135 --> 00:09:15.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
about Jehovah’s sovereignty.

00:09:15.771 --> 00:09:20.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, we need to be realistic

00:09:20.009 --> 00:09:22.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our expectations.

00:09:22.044 --> 00:09:24.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recall that in the first century,

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:27.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stephen and James were executed.

00:09:27.483 --> 00:09:32.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ disciples fled Jerusalem
and lost their possessions.

00:09:32.488 --> 00:09:37.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
These types of things
have already happened since 1914.

00:09:37.493 --> 00:09:41.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of us have been born in a generation

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we have not witnessed firsthand

00:09:43.266 --> 00:09:45.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
the effects of war.

00:09:45.301 --> 00:09:47.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet many of our brothers and sisters

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:52.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
have had to live through wars
and civil unrest of all sorts.

00:09:52.541 --> 00:09:54.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
And some in various places

00:09:54.877 --> 00:09:57.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
are experiencing it now.

00:09:57.847 --> 00:10:01.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how encouraging to consider

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
that so many have faithfully
and successfully endured

00:10:04.987 --> 00:10:07.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
such challenging times!

00:10:07.823 --> 00:10:11.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, the fact
that we see these events occurring

00:10:11.527 --> 00:10:15.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
is evidence that Jehovah will soon intervene

00:10:15.164 --> 00:10:19.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
and put an end to all these wicked things
we see in the world today.

00:10:19.735 --> 00:10:22.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
As one brother said:

00:10:22.238 --> 00:10:24.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The disciples weren’t asking

00:10:24.507 --> 00:10:28.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because they wanted to know
when things would get really bad.

00:10:28.744 --> 00:10:32.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They wanted to know when was the solution

00:10:32.782 --> 00:10:35.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when was the fix going to come.”

00:10:36.819 --> 00:10:41.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Third, we remember
that this is an opportunity

00:10:41.357 --> 00:10:44.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show our trust in Jehovah.

00:10:44.627 --> 00:10:48.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
This reminds me
of an experience of a couple in Japan

00:10:48.597 --> 00:10:51.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
who had lost everything in a flood.

00:10:51.167 --> 00:10:53.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
They said:

00:10:53.169 --> 00:10:57.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We thought that we trusted
in Jehovah before,

00:10:57.039 --> 00:11:01.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
but now we really know what it means!”

00:11:01.444 --> 00:11:04.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as one missionary commented:

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It’s not until your back is against the wall

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:10.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you see Jehovah’s hand.”

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we keep in mind
the words recorded

00:11:13.723 --> 00:11:16.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Isaiah 30:15:

00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:20.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your strength will be
in keeping calm

00:11:20.196 --> 00:11:22.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
and showing trust.”

00:11:22.565 --> 00:11:26.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we remain calm
and show our trust in Jehovah.

00:11:26.869 --> 00:11:29.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have absolute confidence

00:11:29.772 --> 00:11:33.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he knows our brothers’ needs
and will care for them.

00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:36.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
As our 2022 yeartext,

00:11:36.412 --> 00:11:39.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 34:10, reminds us:

00:11:39.148 --> 00:11:43.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Those seeking Jehovah
will lack nothing good.”

00:11:43.986 --> 00:11:48.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps we could illustrate this
with a caregiving situation.

00:11:49.392 --> 00:11:53.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we are caring
for a loved one who is suffering,

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:57.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can be harder
than if we were the one suffering.

00:11:57.767 --> 00:11:59.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is that?

00:11:59.769 --> 00:12:03.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because when we’re the one
suffering a problem

00:12:03.172 --> 00:12:05.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we rely on Jehovah,

00:12:05.508 --> 00:12:08.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
we experience the peace

00:12:08.177 --> 00:12:10.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
that only he can provide.

00:12:10.613 --> 00:12:13.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
But for the caregiver observing it,

00:12:13.549 --> 00:12:15.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can be much harder.

00:12:15.818 --> 00:12:18.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
The caregiver’s imagination can run wild

00:12:18.687 --> 00:12:22.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
with all the problems
and worries and what-ifs.

00:12:22.658 --> 00:12:25.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we see the point?

00:12:25.094 --> 00:12:27.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it comes to our brothers and sisters

00:12:27.797 --> 00:12:30.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are affected
by the war in Eastern Europe,

00:12:30.566 --> 00:12:32.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are much like a caregiver.

00:12:32.968 --> 00:12:35.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re concerned about them.

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:39.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that’s different
than actually being in the situation.

00:12:39.642 --> 00:12:42.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gives his holy spirit

00:12:42.478 --> 00:12:45.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
according to the actual need.

00:12:45.247 --> 00:12:48.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’re sure that Jehovah is providing

00:12:48.317 --> 00:12:53.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
just what our brothers and sisters
in Eastern Europe need at this time.

00:12:53.322 --> 00:12:55.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we remember this,

00:12:55.691 --> 00:12:58.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can help us to cope with our anxiety.

00:13:00.262 --> 00:13:03.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the fourth point that can help us?

00:13:03.232 --> 00:13:06.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must remain neutral.

00:13:06.635 --> 00:13:11.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
We realize that many news reports
may be propaganda

00:13:11.173 --> 00:13:15.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is designed and slanted
to motivate listeners to take sides.

00:13:15.911 --> 00:13:19.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we respond
when we hear such reports?

00:13:19.815 --> 00:13:22.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
We safeguard our hearts and minds,

00:13:22.918 --> 00:13:25.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
realizing that all human governments

00:13:25.421 --> 00:13:28.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
will soon be replaced by God’s Kingdom.

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:30.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that no human efforts

00:13:30.759 --> 00:13:33.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
can bring true peace
and security to the earth

00:13:33.796 --> 00:13:37.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
—only God’s Kingdom can and will do so.

00:13:37.766 --> 00:13:40.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, our hearts and minds

00:13:40.803 --> 00:13:42.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
are devoted to that Kingdom.

00:13:44.139 --> 00:13:46.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve discussed four things

00:13:46.141 --> 00:13:50.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can help us not to be terrified
by the events in Eastern Europe:

00:13:51.213 --> 00:13:53.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
We remember why Jehovah

00:13:53.215 --> 00:13:55.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
allows these things;

00:13:55.284 --> 00:13:58.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
we keep realistic expectations;

00:13:58.888 --> 00:14:01.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
we show our trust in Jehovah;

00:14:01.757 --> 00:14:04.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we remain neutral.

00:14:06.195 --> 00:14:09.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
What has helped
some of our brothers and sisters

00:14:09.064 --> 00:14:13.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
to deal successfully with hearing
“of wars and reports of wars”?

00:14:13.802 --> 00:14:16.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s watch the following video.

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.342 line:10% position:50% align:center
While reading the news

00:14:20.342 --> 00:14:22.545 line:10% position:50% align:center
about the horrific effects of the bombings,

00:14:22.545 --> 00:14:24.713 line:10% position:50% align:center
I felt cut to the heart.

00:14:24.713 --> 00:14:28.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
Feelings of powerlessness
and helplessness overwhelmed me.

00:14:29.385 --> 00:14:31.387 line:10% position:50% align:center
You feel overwhelmed

00:14:31.387 --> 00:14:32.988 line:10% position:50% align:center
by all the news reports on the war,

00:14:32.988 --> 00:14:37.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you pretty much get pulled
into everything that’s happening.

00:14:37.126 --> 00:14:40.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
That definitely affects you
and your thinking,

00:14:40.496 --> 00:14:43.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your neutrality
can really be put to the test.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.735 line:10% position:50% align:center
My family lives in Ukraine,

00:14:46.735 --> 00:14:48.771 line:10% position:50% align:center
so from the beginning of the war,

00:14:48.771 --> 00:14:50.406 line:10% position:50% align:center
I was worried about their safety.

00:14:51.206 --> 00:14:53.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
To keep up-to-date
with what was happening with them,

00:14:53.909 --> 00:14:56.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried to call them every day.

00:14:56.145 --> 00:14:59.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
What I learned from them affected me a lot,

00:14:59.381 --> 00:15:03.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it didn’t allow me to think calmly
about the situation.

00:15:03.619 --> 00:15:06.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was moved by the stories of our brothers

00:15:06.488 --> 00:15:08.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
who had to flee
their homes with their children

00:15:08.624 --> 00:15:11.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to save their lives.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:15.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have found that reading the Bible
often works well for me.

00:15:15.097 --> 00:15:19.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
I read it in the morning, during the day,
and before going to bed.

00:15:19.268 --> 00:15:23.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
It removes negative images
and emotions from my mind

00:15:23.005 --> 00:15:25.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, more important, it often allows me,

00:15:25.708 --> 00:15:28.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
so to speak, to “hear” God’s voice

00:15:28.377 --> 00:15:31.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
and regain my emotional balance.

00:15:31.213 --> 00:15:33.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried to reflect on how Jehovah

00:15:33.816 --> 00:15:36.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
had protected his servants in the past.

00:15:36.151 --> 00:15:38.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also imagined the times

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
described at Psalm 46:9,
which says that “[Jehovah] is bringing an end

00:15:42.491 --> 00:15:44.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
to wars throughout the earth.”

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
This verse reinforces my belief

00:15:47.129 --> 00:15:49.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
that soon Jehovah will destroy all weapons

00:15:49.898 --> 00:15:52.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there will be peace in all the earth.

00:15:52.301 --> 00:15:55.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
I try to pray about specific individuals.

00:15:55.137 --> 00:15:58.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helps me to be more effective
in giving practical help.

00:15:59.708 --> 00:16:04.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve made a real effort
to follow less news on the war.

00:16:04.146 --> 00:16:06.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
What has really helped

00:16:06.849 --> 00:16:09.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
is following the news releases
on our website,

00:16:09.084 --> 00:16:11.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
jw.org,

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
about brothers and sisters
from different countries,

00:16:13.522 --> 00:16:15.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just Ukraine and Russia.

00:16:17.292 --> 00:16:20.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their example of neutrality and loyalty

00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:22.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
has also helped me to keep my focus.

00:16:24.166 --> 00:16:28.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
A lot of things convince me
that the only solution is God’s Kingdom

00:16:28.671 --> 00:16:32.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
—first of all, the stark contrast
between Jehovah’s people

00:16:32.875 --> 00:16:35.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the people who do not believe in him.

00:16:35.044 --> 00:16:38.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no prejudice, no injustice.

00:16:38.781 --> 00:16:40.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re motivated by love for each other,

00:16:40.783 --> 00:16:43.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s beautiful
to see that in every country.

00:16:43.452 --> 00:16:46.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t get carried away
with our own different backgrounds.

00:16:46.255 --> 00:16:50.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s beautiful to see
that it’s possible even now.

00:16:50.426 --> 00:16:53.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure that Jehovah
by means of his Kingdom

00:16:53.729 --> 00:16:58.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
wants and is able to undo all the harm
that results from human rule.

00:16:58.567 --> 00:17:00.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m convinced that only God’s Kingdom

00:17:00.936 --> 00:17:03.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
can provide a lasting solution
to all problems.

00:17:03.939 --> 00:17:07.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
I fully believe in what Jehovah says
because it’s always true.

00:17:09.078 --> 00:17:11.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon, when God’s Kingdom
rules over the whole earth,

00:17:11.547 --> 00:17:14.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we’ll really enjoy peace.

00:17:17.553 --> 00:17:21.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice how they cope
with the trauma of news reports?

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:25.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
They focus on God’s Kingdom as the solution;

00:17:25.561 --> 00:17:28.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
they limit the amount of news they consume;

00:17:28.564 --> 00:17:32.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
meditate on how Jehovah
has helped his servants in the past;

00:17:32.968 --> 00:17:35.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
pray frequently;

00:17:35.003 --> 00:17:37.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
and focus on the time

00:17:37.306 --> 00:17:42.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
when there will be no more war
but instead lasting peace.

00:17:43.378 --> 00:17:47.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt, these same things will help us too.

00:17:47.216 --> 00:17:50.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah understands that we need

00:17:50.219 --> 00:17:54.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only physical support
but also emotional support.

00:17:54.723 --> 00:17:56.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:17:56.725 --> 00:17:59.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
think about the latest <i>Awake!</i>  magazine,

00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:02.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
entitled “A World in Turmoil

00:18:02.264 --> 00:18:03.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
—How You Can Cope.”

00:18:03.966 --> 00:18:05.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
It highlights

00:18:05.968 --> 00:18:08.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
how you can protect your health,

00:18:08.003 --> 00:18:11.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
livelihood, relationships, and your hope.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:13.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for each of these topics,

00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:16.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
it includes helpful tips.

00:18:16.111 --> 00:18:19.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is “food at the proper time”!

00:18:20.282 --> 00:18:23.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the midst of all this turmoil
in Eastern Europe,

00:18:23.652 --> 00:18:27.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
it has been so encouraging
to hear of the generosity

00:18:27.289 --> 00:18:30.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our brothers and sisters in nearby lands.

00:18:30.259 --> 00:18:33.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tens of thousands
have offered accommodations

00:18:33.862 --> 00:18:35.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
to those who are displaced.

00:18:35.964 --> 00:18:38.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many are helping with relief efforts,

00:18:38.834 --> 00:18:42.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether it is assisting those
who arrive at border crossings,

00:18:42.971 --> 00:18:47.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
at relief centers,
or providing food and other basic items.

00:18:48.243 --> 00:18:51.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of their proximity to Ukraine,

00:18:51.046 --> 00:18:54.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers in Hungary, Moldova, Poland,

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:57.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
Romania, Slovakia, and other lands

00:18:57.152 --> 00:19:00.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been very busy
in coordinating relief efforts

00:19:00.355 --> 00:19:02.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
in their branch territories.

00:19:02.558 --> 00:19:05.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
And many are working hard

00:19:05.093 --> 00:19:07.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help our refugee brothers and sisters

00:19:07.596 --> 00:19:10.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get settled and back on their feet.

00:19:10.732 --> 00:19:15.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
We continue to keep
all you dear brothers and sisters

00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:17.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our prayers.

00:19:17.606 --> 00:19:19.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we’ve discussed,

00:19:19.775 --> 00:19:24.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
we do not need to be alarmed
by “wars and reports of wars.”

00:19:24.012 --> 00:19:27.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, we have full confidence

00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:31.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah will continue
to care for his precious sheep.

00:19:33.055 --> 00:19:36.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
