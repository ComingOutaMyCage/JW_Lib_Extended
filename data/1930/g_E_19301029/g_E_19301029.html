<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Estonia w </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ven vest</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">HERE was a time when if people heard the name Estonia they exercised their minds to determine where on earth it was. This is not so common today, when thousands of tourists are visiting it each year; nevertheless there are many who do not know exactly where Estonia is, although they have perhaps an idea. This year about fifteen hundred Americans and British touring the Baltic visited Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. They were mainly from liners visiting the Northern European capitals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Estonian republic is situated on the east coast of the Baltic Sea. To the north is the Gulf of Finland; on the west, the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Riga; on the south the Latvian republic, (mention of which has already been made in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age)</span><span class="font7">; and eastward is the great Lake Peipus and the Soviet republic. Comparisons are sometimes useful to convey ideas; and for those who have been fortunate enough to visit the delightful little country of Denmark it 'will be comparatively easy to think of the size of Estonia, for Estonia is just a little larger. But while it has a greater land surface, its population is by no means as great; for Denmark lias a population of about three millions, whereas Estonia has a population of just over a million, and composed of peoples of four nationalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By far the largest part of the population is Estonian, the balance being Russians 8.2 percent, Germans 1.7 percent, and Swedes .7 percent. It is interesting to note how the various minorities keep to their own particular circles. This is especially noticeable with the Swedes, most of whom are engaged in the fishing industry. They occupy some of the islands to the west, and although forced to trade with the Estonian population of the mainland they very rarely marry any except those of their own nationality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The minorities enjoy a great deal of freedom, and, in this, little Estonia is a living example of tolerance. In contrast with the master Italian terrorist who has endeavored to stamp out the languages of the Italian minorities, I should like to quote from the Estonian Constitution. It provides that :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All Estonian citizens are equal in the eyes of the law. There cannot be any public privileges or prejudices derived from birth, religion, sex, rank or nationality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Estonia, there are no legal class divisions or titles. Science, art, and the teaching of same, are free in Estonia. Education is compulsory for children who have reached the school age, and is free in the elementary schools. The minority nationalities are guaranteed education in their mother tongue. Education is carried on under the control of the government. The members of the minority nationalities within the confines of Estonia may form their own autonomous institutions for the promotion of the interests of their national culture and welfare so far as these do not run contrary to the interests of the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And everywhere there are evidences of the government’s abiding by this declaration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Even the Jews have their own schools where Yiddish and Hebrew are spoken. The Estonians rightly esteem education a very important factor in the life of the nation. About 20 percent of the children completing the elementary school course of six years go to secondary schools. About 2 percent of the population have had a university education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">According to the official figures for 1881 the number of persons 'who could read and write was about 40 percent of the population. It is interesting to compare with the latest figures available, which show that of the whole population the percent of illiterates is 1.9. This would be considerably lower if it were not for the Russian country dwellers who up to the present have not shown the same desire to learn as have the Estonians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">History</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Soon after the beginning of the Christian era Estonia was occupied by the forefathers of the present-day Estonians. They were a sturdy people akin to the Finns and the Hungarians. The relationship of the Finns and Estonians can be clearly noted by the similarity of language, although this is not so pronounced with the Hungarian language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Although living in villages, the Estonians, in order to protect themselves against invasion, erected a number of strongholds. Of these Lin-danissa occupied an important strategic and commercial position, guarding the sea route along the Finnish gulf. When an attempt was made by the German order of knights to conquer Estonia, Lindanissa remained impregnable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was not taken until 1219, when Valdemar the Victorious attacked with a large army. Valdemar proceeded the same year to erect the Castle of Reval. The present name of the capital is Tallinn, or Taani linn, which in English signifies “Danish city”. The name Reval was taken from a local tribe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1285 Tallinn was able to join the Hanseatic League, and the steady increase in prosperity stimulated building activities. As one might expect, many churches were built. The present town hall was erected in the first half of the 14th century, and is the oldest in the Baltic States. The building of the Great Guild, used as an exchange even now, and occasionally for meetings of the Bible Students, was erected in 1405.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Germans controlled until the Russian invasion of 1561, the German order having purchased the possessions of the Danes in 1346. The outcome of the Russian invasion was the dividing of the country between the Poles and the Swedes. The Poles continued to occupy the southern part of Estonia until the whole country was united under Gustavus Adolphus. As a result of the Great Northern War of 1710 Estonia became an autonomous Russian province.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Although this review of Estonian history is very brief, we can easily realize the relief which, was felt by the Estonian people when the events which followed 1917 finally severed the bonds which connected Estonia with the Russian Empire and the independence of Estonia was proclaimed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Religious Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first propagators of “Christianity” (so called) came to Estonia in the beginning of the 12th century. As they accomplished very little by peaceful methods they began to use force in their missionary endeavors. After twenty years of war the inhabitants were forced to embrace the Roman Catholic faith. The Catholic clergy were unable to influence the people to any great extent. The people soon became familiar with the ceremonial side of the Catholic worship and adopted it, seeing what many bright people fail to see today, that it was just another branch of their pagan customs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bible was translated in 1739. It is rather interesting to note in passing that in May, 1920, the Constituent Assembly passed an elementary school law, the second article of which stipulated that education in elementary schools must not include the teaching of Scripture. This law did not meet with general approval, and a bill reintroducing the teaching of Scripture was submitted to the first state assembly. The latter refused to pass it, and so this bill, in accordance with, the Constitution, was made a subject for popular referendum. The great majority of the people decided in favor of this bill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is not without reason, however, that the government regarded with suspicion the teaching of the Scriptures; for, as in all other countries, the clergy have dishonored the God they claim to represent. The churches drew their support from church estates and were under the control of patrons, that is, estate owners of the parish. The patronage system wms enforced until the end of the Russian rule and, as one can imagine, caused estrangement between the church and the parishioners, who regarded the church as the tool of the landowner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the Russian rule the Greek Orthodox church strove to convert the Estonian people by both persuasion and force. Although making some progress, it was unable to realize its aim. Thirty years ago a dissenting movement began with the support of the British and American Methodists, Baptists and various other organizations. And now the Bible Students are here. But what a difference! They are not out to fleece the people, but to tell them about God's kingdom and give the Estonian people hope in their time of need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Travel</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A writer recently commenting upon the Arabs and Jews in Palestine said it was as if a camel and a motor car were passing down the road together. This illustration applies with equal force to the conditions of travel in Estonia. While there are some of the latest means of travel, there are also some extremely slow ways. There is a good aerial connection between Tallinn, Leningrad, Helsinki, Riga and Berlin; and, on the other hand, the railways, and especially the narrow gauge ones, are terribly slow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In fairness, however, it must be said that they are not so slow as they used to be. Many of the trains do the long runs overnight and sleeping accommodation can be obtained by third-class as well as second-class passengers. The International connection with Riga is quite good so far as sleeping facilities are concerned. This is arranged by the International Sleeping Car Company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The sleeping accommodation provided by the State Railway is, to say the least of it, unique. The third-class compartments are not upholstered, and the higher part of the back of the seat comes down on hinges. When these are all down it has the effect of transforming the compartment into a large room full of shelves. Every third-class passenger is entitled to use this accommodation provided he either removes his boots or provides some means of protection so that the shelves do not get dirty. The railway officials are very strict in the enforcement of this regulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is also a special third-class sleeping compartment which one can use upon the payment of a supplement of 50 American cents. The compartment is just the same as the other except that you are furnished with a mattress, pillow, sheets and a blanket. Although these beds are not exactly resilient, under the mattress being bare boards, yet they are very acceptable for long night journeys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is only one drawback, and here is opportunity for someone with inventive ability to give expression to his genius; the mattresses need to be anchored, but are not. In the night, after a series of stops at various stations, the mattress has a nasty habit of sliding off, and it is not an infrequent occurrence to wake up and find that practically from the trunk down one is out of bed. But, as I said, it is preferable to sitting up or lying on the bare boards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the sights of a lifetime is to be in a waiting room or a station buffet in the winter and watch the crowds assemble for the night train. The queerest things imaginable are worn in order to keep out the cold, and there seems to be no end to the variety; and hats—well, anything into which one can reasonably stick the head seems to pass, provided it will keep the head warm. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> has frequently referred to the fact that men are slaves to custom in the matter of dress; here is freedom in abundance, and not without </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font7"> deal of humor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the larger towns the taxi service is really good. The taxis are not like the London ones which a Frenchman once described as ‘houses upon wheels', but are all modern cars, mostly American. Motoi’ buses connect the important agricultural centres with the towns, as well as provide service in the towns themselves. This is very convenient for market purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Markets are well attended in the towns, and in Tallinn it is quite a feature. The Tallinn market is extremely well regulated and is divided into sections for different articles, meat, fish, vegetables, cheese and butter, flowers, and so on. Although no one is in a very great way of business in the market, even then there are differences in the stocks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When one sees an old woman with a basket of apples (looking none too wonderful) sitting for hours trying to earn a few cents, it makes one long for the Kingdom. Judging by the cheery disposition maintained by many under these trying circumstances one can imagine how grandly they will respond to the invitation of the Kingdom when once it is in full sway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. At the back of the market there is a large building, the Estonian Theater. In this building, as well as the theater and concert hall is the studio of the broadcasting company. The programs from the radio studio are good, and include a lecture by the Bible Students every Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Owen Rutter, F. R. G. S., in the “New Baltic States” says: “Although the countryside of the three Baltic States has a certain sameness that at times amounts almost to monotony, it would be hard to find three European towns more different than Kaunas, Riga and Tallinn (Reval). Kaunas is partly Russian; Riga is mainly German. There are scores of towns like Kaunas all over Russia, while Riga, apart from the old quarter, is a European city. But Tallinn is a puzzle. It resembles Pekin in that it is unlike any other in the world. It is curious, original </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I”</span><span class="font7"> And all who have visited these towns will endorse these remarks. Tallinn is a town of red-tiled old building’s, of quaint doorways and arches, and cobbled streets, and a great thing to its credit is that it is clean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It may be that in the future an American reader of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> will visit Estonia and finish the picture of which I have endeavored to give—just a sketch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Events in Canada </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Our Canadian Correspondent</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">S</span><span class="font7">PEAKING- of the cause of present unemployment in this country The Saskatoon </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Star Phoenix</span><span class="font7"> gives as one of the reasons the wheat situation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From Winnipeg statistical bureau comes a statement showing that 227,762,000 bushels of wheat were delivered by farmers in the prairie provinces between August 1, 1929, and May 31, 1930. The money value of this wheat to the farmers is given as $271,091,667.75.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For the corresponding part of the 1927-28 season deliveries were 386,434,207 bushels and the value was $418,500,679.99. For the same period in the 1928-29 season the deliveries were 462,221,478 bushels and the value was $381,338,973.64.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These figures for three ten-month periods are instructive. Between August, 1929, and May, 1930, the farmers received $110,000,000 less for wheat than in the same months of the 1928-29 season, and $147,000,000 less than in the same months of the 1927-28 season. Anyone who wants to know the cause of unemployment in western Canada will find it here. The sale of wheat is the west’s chief source of income. If anything happens to it, everyone feels the effects. Credit is curtailed, there is less money in circulation, and jobs are lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Tax Burden ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While Canadians may not be the heaviest taxed people in the world, the following editorial appearing in the last paper above quoted shows that they pay plenty:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Out of every $100 worth of wealth produced in Canada in 1928, taxation took $17.15. This seems high, but it was lower than in preceding years. In 1922 the figure was even $20, and in 1923 it was $19.70. These statistics arc from the latest pamphlet published by the Citizens’ Research Institute of Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The total amount of taxes levied from the Canadian people grew from $589,628,957 in 1922 to $718,736,166 in 1928, an increase of more than one-fifth. But the total net production of all Canadian industries rose from less than three billions to more than four billions in the same six-year period. Thus the weight of taxes was cut down. The percent of the citizen’s dollar taken by the tax collector was lowered from 20 to 17.15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The figures given on taxation include the levies imposed by all governments in the Dominion. It is interesting to note that in 1928 the federal government took in taxes about nine percent, the provinces less than two percent, and the municipalities more than six percent of net production. Though Canadians are more lightly taxed than most other nations, taxation does form one of the chief items in their cost of living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Keeping Down the Sea Lions</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following news item in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Canadian Press</span><span class="font7"> regarding the slaughtering of sea lions is interesting:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Machine guns and rifles are again being brought to bear against the herds of sea lions which congregate in British Columbia coastal waters and cause great yearly loss to salmon and other commercial fish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For several years an expedition has been equipped with firearms and sent against the sea lion hordes. Every year hundreds of the mammals are slaughtered on their various rookeries, but in spite of the losses suffered by the herds there are invariably a sufficient number left to cause widespread destruction to the salmon run.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fisheries patrol cruiser Givenchy carried the sea lion expedition this year. In her bow was mounted a machine gun with a gunner in charge whose first experience was in the trenches of Northern France when the object of attack was German infantry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">O</span><span class="font7">NCE upon a time there were some makers of honest thread. What has become of them? The honest thread was wound upon an honest spool. When you bought thread it was good thread, and wound on a spool so as to give you as much thread as possible and as . little wood as possible. Now the thread is wretched stuff, full of knots and splits, and just! enough of it on the surface of the spool to cover J the wood. It would seem as if here is a chance’ for some honest manufacturer to make a living? If he could prove that he makes first-class; thread and winds it on an honest spool the public could be taught to pay for it what it is worth.<sup>1 </sup>But the public are weary of poor thread wound on a bogus spool. This is the opening gun for better thread and more of it for the money.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font7">T NEW CASTLE, Delaware, where formerly there; were thirty-three heavily armed guards in tire state prison there are now only six unarmed ones, and only three of them on duty at a time. The prisoners are all on the honor system. Last year they earned $29,000 to send home to their families, besides other sums saved for their own use. They manage the prison, only the warden overruling decisions of the foremen. Once subsisting on meals costing but eight cents apiece they now have meals averaging 26c apiece and yet the prison costs less to run than it did when the meals were poor. When farmed out as laborers the prisoners receive $2 a day, half of which goes to the state and the other half to the man himself. On release 87 percent of the prisoners go straight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">On an Overtime Basis</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A </span><span class="font7">MICHIGAN subscriber was talking with a lady friend as to why it takes so much money to get people out of purgatory, if there is such a place, and she solved the matter by suggesting that if a priest puts in his overtime praying for the poor souls in purgatory it is only right that he should be paid for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But right away the question comes up about the rate of pay, the union regulations, work on Sundays and holidays and Saturday afternoons, and who belongs to the union, and how to get into it, and somehow it makes the whole thing have too commercial an aspect. It is usual to pay time and a half for overtime, and double time on Sundays and holidays.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Child Adultism </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By H. Sillaway (Tennessee)'</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font7">T IS a well recognized fact that the mental machinery of man as a race is pretty well out of order. Dr. Joseph Collins, in commenting on the perverse traits and tastes of our unbalanced civilization, declares the trouble is a lack of emotional development, which he defines by the rather far-fetched term of “infant-adultism”. In his diagnosis of this mental disorder he points out many things in our emotional makeup that are merely hangers-on from childhood. In this we are in hearty accord with Dr. Collins, who contends that our social evils are but symptoms of this underlying malady which affects us as a people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He tells us the remedy is a system of emotional training, which he believes to be entirely practical. And while there is no question that the cure for this evil is necessarily educational in nature, yet is it within human possibility for’ an emotionally dwarfed race to recognize its mental defect sufficiently to successfully launch an educational program for its correction?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But few have recognized the deep-seated character of this malady, for it is not as some suppose, a mere surface disorder affecting only an element of society, but it is rooted in the very foundation of our social order itself, and none have escaped its baneful influence. And back of this social arrangement is its author and director, his satanic majesty, with whom man is utterly unable to cope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fact that the influence of our social order is toward a prevention of development of the mental functions in which the emotions have their balance indicates that its director has a purpose in the exercise of this influence. This purpose is not difficult to trace, for it is plainly evident that Satan’s strangle hold upon the race is made possible by this very lack of mental development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The emotions are merely an expression of the mental state of the individual—an index, as it were, of his mental development; and the training of the emotions lies in the adult development of the true moral plane of reasoning. Man’s mentality is made up of three distinct planes. The lowest of these is the impulsive, which to some extent is possessed by the lower animals. The mechanical plane comes next, and the majority of people do not develop their mental faculties above it. The conditions of environment are usually antagonistic to the development of the moral-logical mind, which represents the full adult development of human mentality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With those of an energetic nature there is little to prevent the full adult development of the mechanical reasoning powers to the full extent of the ability of the individual; but the development of the moral reasoning powers usually stops at ages varying from eight to fifteen years. The moral plane of reasoning is the plane of judgment on questions of equity, and by its exercise questions of a Biblical, social, political, and financial nature are correctly determined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The mechanical reasoning powers are a necessity in the daily routine of life. Without them, man would be helpless, with no scientific or mechanical ability. But mechanical reasoning ability is seldom balanced by ability of moral judgment, and as the result the average person reasons on religious, social and political questions mechanically. He cannot rise to a higher plane of reasoning, because his mental enuron-nient prevents its development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The manifest symptoms of emotional i</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font7">aturity due to this lack of development of the moral-logical reasoning faculties is evident in the childish tastes and pleasures of the people as a whole. The gregarious tendency seen in the multitude of social organizations; the love of pomp and of imposing ceremonies; the individual desire to shine above others; the absurdities of and slavery to style and custom; the near to social caste lines separating the rich from the poor; the jazz mania, race prejudice, etc., are all a fruitage of undeveloped emotions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Children are noise lovers. The retired farmer leaves the peace and quiet of the country for the noise and glamor of city life, and thus manifests the emotional childishness of an immature nature. The childish taste for noise is brought to the front in our modern music, which in large part is only noise with a mere musical setting. Orators and clergymen who raise their voices to a harsh roar of swift flowing language are always popular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A child lives in an atmosphere of mysteriousness. It is surrounded by things, conditions and circumstances its undeveloped mind is unequal to. Because of its confidence in the superior knowledge of its elders, it accepts their explanations of these things with little question. The majority never outgrow this childhood mind. The environment by which they are surrounded prevents the exercise of the higher reasoning faculties, and therefore they remain dormant. As the result they are dupes to every deceiving influence from fake stock and partisan politics to ecclesiastical domination and insidious, lying war propaganda.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Gardening, farming and weather predicting is still extensively done by certain rules of supposed moon influences for which there is no scientific reason whatever. The average voter is either a republican or a democrat, although unable to give a logical reason for party choice. The church member is incapable of logical Bible reasoning on doctrinal questions, and as a result his doctrinal deductions are nonsense and foolishness. The worship of the creature, and back of it the baneful influence which produces it, is the underlying cause of this woeful lack of a mature mental development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Strange as it may seem, it is nevertheless true that the nearest approaches to a mature development of the higher reasoning faculties are more often found among those of only ordinary mental talents. The reason for this would seem to be that high education, super-talents and financial superiorities usually do not favor a mental attitude favorable to the influences tending toward a development of these faculties. In fact, the attitude of the individual toward the existing order of things has much to do with the creation of a favorable atmosphere for such mental development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thought functions through a double mental picture made up in the one part by whatever is reasoned upon, and in the other part by a corresponding reasoning base. Conclusions are arrived at by an oscillation of thought waves between these two points. With the lower animals this function is exercised in its most simple form, in which, as it were, the thing reasoned upon is a simple question mark and the reasoning base a mere interrogation point. Their thought waves drive in a straight unbroken line with no complexities in sluggish, heavy undulations between the points of its operation. This is one-dirnensional reasoning, though some of the more intelligent among these, as the dog, sometimes manifest mental traces of a two-dimensional capacity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Two-dimensional thought is a flat surface form of reasoning. In this form of thought functioning the subject matter of thought is surrounded by a reasoning base with little or no height or depth. Tw<sup>T</sup>o-dimensional reasoning is purely impulsive. Many people reason principally in two-dimensional channels, thereby manifesting a very low development of even the mechanical plane of mental capacity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mechanical thought is three-dimensional, and in its full development is complete in itself in the sphere of its capacity, but an attempt to use it in the higher phase of thought, which in reality is fourth-dimensional, results in a mere surface action in which it reasons all around a subject, but never enters really into it. It is perhaps a new thought to some that man’s mental powers are capable of rising above a three-dimensional plane. But if the mental faculties are to be considered at all from a dimensional standpoint, it is nevertheless true. The angels are fourth-dimensional creatures, yet we have no evidence whatever that their mental capacities differ in any way from that of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A question naturally arising in connection with the subject of child-adultism is, What moral responsibilities has one who is thus undeveloped in his higher mental faculties? This is a question that cannot well be ignored, as it is vitally important in our dealings and associations with our fellow men. It is evident that in all questions involving equity the individual cannot be responsible beyond his ability to reason rationally. Every person of average intelligence is able to discern between certain outward principles of right and wrong, even though his mental faculties are, through undevelopment, unequal to handling questions of a moral-logical nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This principle is fitly illustrated in the clergy, who as a class show’ a very low<sup>7</sup> development of their reasoning faculties. Because of the talent of clothing their ideas in an eloquent setting of language they have been generally looked up to as men of super-intelligence; but the fact is, brilliancy of expression in no sense measures the mental pow<sup>T</sup>ers of the individual, and there is little logic behind the average sermon. As a profession the clergy manifest a reasoning deficiency that is appalling. But they are moralists in theory, and dv<sup>r</sup>ell fluently on the moral precepts of the Scriptures. By their own -words they are judged in their hard-hearted hypocrisy and bitter antagonism towards the truth and those -who dispense it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With the untrained emotions of the race running wild in impulsively followed channels man is securely chained to the satanic order which rules the environment of his existence, and is helpless as a race to release himself from the web of circumstances that securely hold him in a state of child-adultism. The remedy, and only remedy, is Christ’s kingdom, which, through the binding of Satan, will destroy the deceiving influences which now hinder mental development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A friendly Suggestion to Mars By </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Wm. R. Gray (Ontario)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font7"> AM going to tell you something of the village A of Fergus, Ont.; perhaps you can use it in your paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Fergus is a very busy place, a large manufacturing place, being the home of Beatty Bros., Ltd., the largest firm in their line in the British Empire. They make electric washers and stable fittings, hay carriers, pumps, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The firm, buys home sites of fifty feet frontage, helps the employees to build, or builds for them, and gives them steady employment, because it is very aggressive in merchandising its products, controlling about sixty percent of the Canadian trade in the washing machine business, and about eighty percent of the hay carriers and stable fittings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Beatty company has contributed largely to an arena for sports which would hold a, large portion of the inhabitants of the village. There is also under way a large swimming pool, or tank, which will be heated by steam from the ■ factory. This, I understand, is to cost about twenty thousand to twenty-five thousand dollars, and to be used by the entire village.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The management of this firm are great believers in good, clean outdoor sport, giving great encouragement to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I have not at any time seen any of the management use tobacco. In the recent election the village was almost unanimous for prohibition, although prohibition did not come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To look this over one would almost think things were ideal in this village.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The firm has. a model farm, with a herd of Jersey cattle, and has just built a dairy, so as to supply the village with pure Jersey milk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The picture is good up to this point; almost like the Millennium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is only one smudge on the picture: Manufacturing costs are continually being cut by the use of new machines; more and more production is the cry. Not one manufacturer that I have ever talked with seems to realize that machines are not ready customers. If they keep on replacing humans by machinery, and thereby eliminating wages, where are the markets coming;from? Mars, perhaps!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Honesty m Cincinnati</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font7">T IS only a few years since dope peddlers were openly doing business in Cincinnati, and openly boasting that nobody could or would interfere with their business. The principal dealer had fixed it up in advance with the district attorney. In view of this outrageous example of dishonesty we think our readers wfill appreciate the following report of a “sermon” by Rev. Anthony Bevis Beresford at Mohawk church in that city. The one who sent in the clipping wrote on the margin, “Imagine anyone’s listening to this and believing it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Never has there been so much practical Christianity in the world as is now among gainful pursuits. The whole paper structure of present-day finance, bonds, stocks, agreements, are no better than, the characters who issue them—be these nations or individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Honor is the demand and support of business the world over. Speaking the truth out of a sincere heart is practiced more universally today than the cynic would have us believe. The cynic would have us believe that all men are liars, and that a lie repeated one hundred times will serve all the purposes of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is absolutely untrue. If everybody spoke the truth for one week it would absolutely not bring on another World War. Truth is spoken daily in business establishments and homes. The newspapers tell nothing but the truth. Millions of pages of daily advertising carry nothing but the truth. Even in diplomacy, truth now prevails. This is not astonishing, however. Long ago Bismark said, “I have learned how to fool the other diplomats. I tell them the truth.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">* An Essay on Eugenics</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font7">NYONE with imagination, and sympathy must at times be appalled by the immense amount, of suffering in the world. About once in a generation a devastating war destroys hundreds and thousands of lives, and leaves great numbers of cripples and breaks countless hearts. The progress won by toil and. life-long-work is swept away with fire and sword.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are not much better off in peace times. All the time an immense number of weakly persons are suffering from disease and infirmities of one kind or another. The lives of the bright and healthy are often devoted to caring for feeble relatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Who can estimate the embarrassment and disappointment, to say nothing, of the great economic loss, occasioned by the birth of feebleminded children? Such children sometimes come to parents who appear to be unusually intelligent and fortunate in every way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then there is the frightful burden of vice and crime, costing several billion dollars a year in the United States alone. Many dollars greatly needed for education and for all sorts of constructive purposes have to be spent upon the maintenance of prisons, courts, and police forces, and for other means of protecting society. While a misplaced sentimentality often bestows more sympathy upon the criminal than upon his victim, we need to bear in mind the huge amount of suffering caused by evildoers, and the shame and regret felt by their relatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No wonder that sensitive souls feel over-w<sup>T</sup>helmed by the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Weltschmers.</span><span class="font7"> Every person with a spark of good will in his heart wishes in some way to lessen the burden of human suffering, and modern society has established under the auspices of the state and of the church and through private beneficence immense philanthropic machinery for the purpose of alleviating the burdens of our fellow men. There is no end to the appeals which reach generous people for contributions to these objects. Yet after all we do not seem to be making very marked progress. The number of those needing aid appears to increase faster than help can be rendered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Modern science has put into our hands means of preventing much of this suffering. The study of human heredity reveals the possibility of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By K. C. MacArthur (Mass.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“a charity to end charities”. In eugenics, the science which deals with the conscious direction of human existence, we have a means of affecting for good the inborn qualities which play so large a part in determining a happy, wholesome human life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Anyone who has kept domestic animals knows that while food and care are of great importance, yet “blood tells”. Careful investigators find reason for believing that the same principle holds true of the human stock also. Physical heredity is obvious to anyone who observes families carefully, and there is much evidence to indicate the inheritance of mental and moral traits also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the other hand, certain families cursed with a heredity of shiftlessness, lack of foresight, and indifference to the rights of others produce for generation after generation an ever increasing horde of inferior human beings v'ho cause an immense amount of loss and suffering to others. The well-known Jukes family has cost the state of New York something over two million dollars, and nearly all its representatives have been drunkards, paupers, prostitutes, and criminals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the other<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark9">1</a></sup> hand, certain families, like the Jonathan Edwards descendants, the Adamses, the Lees, have for generation after generation produced healthy, high-minded citizens with the minds for leadership. As Professor E. A. Ross, of the University of Wisconsin, has said, “Of such are the kingdom of Heaven,” and if we are ever to have an ideal society, a commonwealth of Christ, a golden age, we must have finer human beings. The educator and the social worker must have responsive material with which to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Eugenics Society seeks definitely to do away with certain great social evils which cause untold suffering. Scholars affiliated with the movement have called attention to the bad effects of modern war, which eliminates so large a proportion of the best men and leaves the maids unwedded or else married to the men who failed to pass the physical and mental tests for military service. It opposes the doctrine of certain religious bodies who believe that their best men and women should remain celibate as a part of their devotion to the religious life. It views with alarm the tendency of so many of the best country young people to go to cities and there to have but few children, so that rural</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">districts are greatly denuded of their most alert young men and women, whose families die out in one or two generations under urban environment. The eugenists believe that they can eliminate a high proportion of vice and crime by restricting the reproduction of those persons who fail to possess normal self-control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The positive objectives are birth release on the part of superior stocks, that is, the kind of people who have good health, normal intelligence, and ability to adjust themselves to the requirements of living in society. This is to be brought about by education, by appeals to family pride, to patriotism, and to religious idealism. It is hoped that some system of child allowances can be worked out for various superior groups, so that the economic stability of the home may not be menaced by the birth of additional children. Such plans are already in force on a large scale in Europe and in this country for the benefit of foreign missionaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The methods of restricting the less desirable human stocks are: segregation in colonies; the employment of surgical sterilization, which is now legal in twenty-four states of the union, and does not involve any suffering of the individual and prevents the birth of children who would be only a liability to society; and also the use of simple methods of birth control, so that persons who should not have children may not produce these poor unwanted babies who are doomed too often to live lives of unhappiness. The last method is as yet hampered by restrictive legislation, but it is probable that these laws will be repealed and that clinics will be openly held throughout this country aS they are in Holland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We need to realize that the whole eugenics problem is not an effort to reduce human life to the standards of the barnyard, nor a cold, harsh method of eliminating the unfit, but is rather an enterprise harmonizing with our highest Christian ideals, and one which tends toward an intelligent and permanent elimination of many of the causes of human unhappiness. This means the building of the kingdom of righteousness, peace, and joy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">N’lrsmg </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Leona B. Johnson (Indiana)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">O</span><span class="font7">NE of the oldest and best-knovm of women’s professions of high standing is that of nursing. Very little publicity is accorded this profession, which is a result of the fact that as a woman’s profession it is overshadowed and controlled by the medical “octopus”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The medical profession is one of the strongest and most powerful organizations known today. There is hardly another organization, of whatever gigantic proportions, that can so intimately dictate rules of conduct to people, from that of the exalted office of president of the United States down to that of the humblest citizen, as can a single member of the medical profession. The physician’s word is usually accepted as gospel truth, and thus he has an advantage over any other professional man. Not even the clergy enjoy such faith in these days of skepticism. However, there are signs which indicate that even the medico will do well to keep his eye on his business to keep even with the modern mental tendency toward truth-seeking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Just how this mental attitude will affect nursing as a profession in the future, if at all, remains to be seen. But how the medical profession affects it now may readily be seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To begin with, no physician could maintain a reputation as a successful “surgeon” overnight were it not for the well trained and strictly disciplined nurses of the hospital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Any patient upon whom an operation is deemed necessary is immediately sent to a hospital. Here the patient is received by nurses (both student and graduate) and prepared physically and mentally for an ordeal usually looked upon by the patient as the less of two evils. The scheduled hour arrives. Every possible preparation known to nursing to insure safe and successful termination of the operation has been performed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Immediately following an operation the nurse’s care is of paramount importance to the patient’s comfort and recovery. In fact, no such comfort or recovery is at all possible without the constant attendance of excellent nurses, even though the patient may be well attended by physicians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In view of this fact, it is a sb ‘.king truth that no attempts are made either by nurses themselves or by physicians to level the extreme differences between the financial rewards of nursing and those of medicine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The physician at present is not required to be in training many more years than is the nurse. Especially now that a college education is requisite for entrance to the best schools of nursing, and four years of training in a hospital to obtain a diploma (requiring no small outlay of cash), the nurse should be able to look forward to more than fair prospects of remunerative work. But is such an outlook possible? Far from it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Following is an outline of the situation as it really exists today. The aspiring young woman with high school and college credits in her hand timidly presents herself to the imposing personality known as the superintendent of nurses. She is given an application and a booklet explaining the rules of entrance into the hospital school. This she fills out, with references from friends and clergyman. Thus, with high hopes for the future, and in complete innocence of the possibilities of torture in the next three or four years, she begins her nurses’ training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first two or three months are spent at the expense of great weariness both mental and physical. The hours are unmercifully long; so long, in fact, that it is remarkable that hospital management is allowed to escape legal punishment for such procedure. The day shift begins at seven a.m. and ends at seven p.m. Three hours are supposed to be relief or time off duty. However, classes usually of one or two hours’ duration are taken out of these hours when the nurse is supposed to be free from duty. It can hardly be called rest or recreation to attend a class for student nurses after having been doing bedside nursing for the other seven or eight hours of a nurse’s ten- or eleven-hour day. The night nurse, especially, resents the fact that after having been on duty all night, frequently twelve hours without relief, she must be wakened in the middle of the day to attend one or two classes just when she needs rest and sleep the most.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Even those on day duty can seldom depend upon being relieved at seven p.m. as they should be. If nothing happens to crowd one’s work (unusual occurrence!), one may go at seven p.m.; otherwise, the nurse may still find herself on duty doing unfinished and never-ending tasks as late as eight, nine or even ten p.m. On days like this the nurse can comfort herself with the thought that such long nerve-wracking labor makes it possible for physicians and hospital managers to provide luxuries, such as La Salle motor cars for their sons, and trips to Europe for their daughters. Can such long hours in an atmosphere of pain and suffering with such fatiguing -work do anything but undermine the health of such girls? Of course not. Nowhere is there such long sick lists as among nurses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These long hours of hard labor are not the only hardship connected with nurses’ training. The school is not satisfied with draining every ounce of vitality and intelligence of the pupil for the benefit of the school and its physicians. It must also impose such restrictions on the personal rights and liberties of the pupil that she is not even permitted to use in her own way what few hours of the twenty-four are left to her. How any system of education or organization has the temerity to deprive free citizens of their natural rights and freedom is beyond understanding. Only in schools of correction for the vcayward would such methods be reasonable. The opposite of this is obviously the truth. Why should any self-respecting young woman of high school or college education and, therefore, undoubtedly of age, be treated like a kindergarten pupil or, even -worse, like a jailbird ? which is the case when she is commanded not to remain away from the nurses’ home later than ten p.m. on pain of dismissal or abrogation of some of their so-called “privileges”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The only object in imposing such restricting rules is that nurses will be in better condition to do the work of slaves. The word “slaves” is here used correctly, in view of the fact that most hospitals give nurses no monetary compensation for the most gruelling labor. Others stretch it a point or two and do give the nurse a little pin money, usually from five to ten dollars a month. These hospitals apparently believe nurses should be able to live on poor prospects and an even worse diet. How a nurse can supply herself with books, uniforms, shoes, aprons, hose, etc., for duty, much less decent dress clothes, on such a measly sum is incomprehensible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For the sake of argument we will assume that nurses do have money enough to maintain themselves for three or four years in the hope that at the end of that time they will enjoy the benefits of these sacrifices, namely, steady remunerative work. But do they thus benefit by this profession acquired at such great expense to health, money and liberty?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In most hospitals the graduates secure their cases through the hospital’s own registry. Every year these hospitals graduate a new class of nurses. A few naturally drop out of active nursing. But allowing for those who drop out, it soon becomes impossible for a hospital registry to supply all its graduates with work. More nurses graduate each year, but the hospital’s patient capacity seldom increases. The result is that a nurse places her name on the registry and waits her turn for a case. Therefore, when fifty or sixty nurses are registered for work and few cases are to be had, a nurse may wait one, two, or even three weeks for a case lasting possibly a week or two or perhaps not that long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A graduate nurse is expected to work one of two shifts. One shift is a twelve-hour shift without relief, either from seven p.m. till seven a.m. or from seven a.m. till seven p.m. The other arrangement is what is termed a twenty-hour day, meaning that the nurse is required to be with her patient constantly night and day with the exception of four hours off in the afternoon (if possible). She is not permitted to ask more than seven dollars for a twelve-hour day or night or eight dollars for a twenty-hour day. Therefore, if she waits three weeks (which is not at all uncommon) for a case lasting one week she has made fifty or fifty-six dollars in a month, provided she can collect it. Considering her original investment of time, money and vitality expended in training, such a return is obviously absurd. Such business could hardly be honestly termed a profession, although it could truthfully be called a big fraud from beginning to end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It may be contended that no one is forced to enter a training school for nurses, and if they do it it is their own misfortune. To that idea willing assent could be given were it not for the fact that those who enter such schools do so and even remain in them because of false representations made to them by those desiring’ them to enter such schools. The idea is stressed to the prospective nurse that great financial, moral and social benefit is to be derived from nursing, when those making such claims know they are positively not so. Thus injury is added to insult in inducing gullible girls to enter three years or more of slavish servitude to an organization that will be the sole one to benefit by such an arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In other types of vocational and business colleges the management is required by law to tell the exact truth in their advertisements and in the claims they make for their schools. If they do not, they are in danger of being severely punished by law. Why, then, should schools of nursing be exempt from such laws ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When every school of nursing is forced to give the student the exact equivalent in training and education of what they require of the student in valuable time and effort, we shall find far fewer but much better schools. They will also be able to graduate only a fraction of the number now turned out annually, and those who do graduate will be far more likely to benefit by a real profession. As it is now, any greedy person with sufficient capital to establish the equipment for a hospital can secure nursing service for a return of very nearly nothing by making extravagant and wholly untruthful promises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Nursing education should be attempted only by a limited number of the very best equipped hospitals for that purpose, and then only by permission and under rigid inspection and superintendence of educational authorities. Such promiscuous and unregulated attempts at educating nurses as is now the case by those selfishly interested in the monetary gain would thus be eliminated, and nurses would be freed from a wage slavery comparable to that of the negroes during actual slavery. That such a disgraceful condition obtains today hand in hand with the enlightenment of these modern times is almost unbelievable. How long is this condition to remain a reproach to intelligent people ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A Prison Without Bars </span><span class="font4">[Reprinted from the Sheridan (Wyo.) </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Post-Enterprise]</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font7">N THE province of Ontario there is a prison the like of which cannot be found anywhere in the United States. It is a prison without any walls or barred windows; a prison where no guard carries a gun or a club, where any prisoner could escape at any time simply by walking away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It includes in its list of prisoners some of Canada’s most “dangerous” men—there are, for instance, more than 100 criminally insane lifers kept there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yet it is conducted without any trouble. It has never had a riot or anything approaching one. It keeps its 700 convicts and has an average of only two escapes a year. Not one of its supposedly desperate lifers has tried to escape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This contrasts so amazingly with most prisons south of the international border—with Auburn, Dannemora and Canon City, for instance—that it is worth a good bit of consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The prison is located at Guelph, and it was instituted a quarter of a century ago by Dr. Fred Leonard, who had been warden of the Ohio State Reformatory but whose plans for conducting a prison were “too idealistic and visionary” for the hard-headed Ohioans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is handled along very simple lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are 950 acres of prison land, divided into farms, dairies and orchards. In addition there are woolen mills, a cannery, a wood-working factory, a bed factory and a quarry, all operated by the prisoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus there is a full-time job for every man in the prison. There is no dreary idleness. Every man is kept busy. Every man is trusted. Every man has a good place to sleep and good food to eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Every man, in short, is treated as though lie were a decent human being. And—let those Americans who object to the “coddling” of prisoners consider this—every man responds to this sort of treatment. There are no riots. There is no discontent. There are no more escapes than there are in the average heavily-barred and heavily-guarded prison in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Most important of all, no prisoner staying there comes to feel that society is his oppressor, his enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is a great lesson in that Ontario prison for the authorities south of the border; a lesson for the authorities, and a lesson for the rest of us as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If you give decent treatment you will get a decent response, whether you’re dealing with ordinary mortals or with criminals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Graphology , </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Ruth Farrer (California)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">G</span><span class="font7">RAPHOLOG Y is the science of determining disposition and aptitude by analyzing the handwriting of the subject. This science is yet in its infancy. As represented in English and American handbooks of handwriting, graphology is a pseudo-science, founded on half-truths and teeming with fads. But, year by year, investigators are putting graphology on its true scientific foundation. As more international interest is aroused in this subject, greater contributions will be made; and thus it will gain world-wide respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Common Objections to Graphology</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many believe that handwriting is not connected with the make-up of the writer but depends exclusively on the muscular constitution of the hand. Now, to these not used to studying handwriting, writing done by the left hand of a writer normally right-handed seems completely different. Actually the most important change is in the angle of writing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Experiments have been made which prove that writing done by means of the toes and mouth, if practiced, will conform to the individuality of the writer as does the hand-writing. This shows that the muscles of the hand do not determine the quality of the handwriting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In another experiment, a young student was hypnotized. First, it was suggested that he was a cunning peasant, then a miser, and lastly, a very poor man. When, in each state of hypnotism, the student was given a pen, the handwriting changed with each role imposed upon him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Crepieux-Jamin, an early graphologist, has reproduced the writing of a giant and of a dwarf. No expert would be able to tell from the script which was written by the larger hand. Graphologists conclude from these and other experiments that handwriting is really “brainwriting” . . . the brain being the dictator of the writing, instead of any muscular formation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another objection to. graphology is that the writing materials (paper, pen, and ink) are more decisive for handwriting than disposition and mood. Graphologists admit that the materials used do influence the writing. Nothing is more true. Knowing this, they take these conditions into consideration before submitting an opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Others claim that handwriting is too greatly influenced by the school copy book to admit of determining individual characteristics. You would be surprised to know how quickly a person’s handwriting may change. I have noticed the handwriting- of students change within a month of their graduation. This change depends solely on the change of environment and the circumstances of the writer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When a writer settles down to one special task and is very regular in his habits, very few changes will be shown. The forms of the letters will remain about the same, but with the moods of each day the slant and balance of the writing will change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In commercial life it is often found that people write a copy-book hand. This is because it is necessary to be precise and to follow rules set by other people. I recently heard of a college professor who wrote a “beautiful hand” in the classroom, but whose writing in a private notebook reminded one of the path of a drowned fly backing down on its trail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Others contend that members of one profession usually write a similar hand, while they do not have similar dispositions. To those experienced in graphology, all writings are different, as all people are different in some respect. We know that not all of the members of one profession are built the same mentally and physically; therefore these differences may be looked for in their handwriting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Still others attempt to overthrow graphology, stating that handwriting changes continually while the make-up of the writer remains the same. After studying this science, it will be seen that all the characteristics denoting moods and physical conditions are apt to change at any time, depending upon the circumstances and environment of the writer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Anyone may demonstrate this for himself. Procure a page of your handwriting written when feeling downcast, depressed, or very tired. Then compare this specimen with one written when you were feeling in the best of spirits or while optimistic or ambitious. You will readily see that the lines of writing in one will descend, indicating the gloomy mood or the spirit of the pessimist. In the other you will notice that the lines of writing are either horizontal or slightly ascending, denoting optimism. When the writer is in a state of great exhilaration and buoyancy, you will notice, the lines of writing ascend still more. On the other hand, it is found that the signs denoting disposition remain practically the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The History of Graphology</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Before the scientific value of graphology was made known, many scrutinized handwriting to deduce the general characteristics of the writer. The ascetic taste was the basis of the judgment. This hobby was indulged in by the following well known people: Edgar Allan Poe, Robert and Mrs. Browning, Goethe, Leibnitz, Madame de Stael, and Baudelaire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first known book on this theme was written by Camille Baldo, and was published at Capri in 1622. In 1792 a German historian wrote a treatise on graphological analysis. In 1823 the Englishman, Stephen Collett, wrote a similar work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The history of graphology really begins with Abbe Hypolite Michon . . . his predecessors had not written any fundamental essays on the subject. The word “graphology” was coined in 1871 by Michon. Michon believed that particular signs in handwriting called for a corresponding quality or trait in the writer. As time went on, however, others improved on Michon’s doctrine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Crepieux-Jamin is the next important French graphologist. He taught that a characteristic might be shown by several different symptoms or signs and that deductions cannot be made from omitted signs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Until 1895 the German graphologists were influenced by their French colleagues. One of these early German graphologists, W. Langcn-bruch, inspired William Thierry Preyer, an Englishman by birth. It was Preyer who first proved that hand-writing is really brain-writing, lie recognized that by experiment only, and not by intuitive theory, could characteristics be properly interpreted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1894 Hans H. Busse, a highly gifted worker, founded the German Graphological Society at Munich. This society published a monthly journal which served to stimulate interest in the young science.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1901 Dr. Georg Meyer published a book in which he criticized the principles of former rules and followed new lines of thought. Dr. Klages, writing in the journal of the German Graphological Society, praised the work of Dr. Meyer. It was reserved to Dr. Klages to sweep away the last vestiges of amateurish graphology. The various causes which produce variations in the appearance of writing were explained. A definite line was drawn between fact and fiction. Dr. Klages wrote several books since 1908 which contain most of the wmrth-while graphology to this date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Graphologies! Signs</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Briefly, graphologists delineate disposition and aptitude by the following characteristics shown in the writing: size, slope, thickness, spacing, connections between letters and between words, capitals, final strokes, punctuation, lines, shape, speed, flourishing, signatures, general style, and the many forms in. which the individual letters are executed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A. New Science for the Benefit of Humanity</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Today a new science has been opened up. Indeed, in the big city of Los Angeles, there are but three experts in this new line. These scientists examine questioned documents to determine many kinds of forgeries and irregularities. It is found that not all forms and degrees of forgeries can elude discovery when examined under high-powered microscopes, stereoscopes, and color-microscopes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For a rather large consideration, these scientists will examine handwriting, typing, stamps, and all kinds of questioned documents. They will photograph them and stand before a jury and demonstrate, showing very clearly the forgery and how it was found. When one considers the time these people have spent in training, and the cost of their machines, it is seen that they often render a great service to humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Much money has been saved and, indeed, many crooks have been apprehended by means of this new science which is so different from graphology. But many temptations stand in the way of the photographer and examiner of questioned documents. Like those confronting the lawyers, offers of bribes occasionally bother these handwriting experts. Most of these experts do not care to know the claims of their clients, thus eliminating what might have been a temptation to use their talent criminally.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">“Sixty Persons Ill Following Picnic in Arkansas Town. Special Dispatch to the News and Leader. Pocahontas, Ark., July 12.—Sixty persons were poisoned, 12 seriously, from eatingsandwiches at a candidates picnic at Birdell, seven miles west of here. Dr. J. W. Brown of Pocahontas reported tonight that he believed all the victims would recover. The candidates in opening their joint campaign of Randolph county served barbecue meat sandwiches which had been kept in metal containers last night. About 60 persons rvere reported ill from ptomaine poisoning soon after the lunch was served.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No one should mistake this editor for a fool in allowing an article like this to see the light of day, for instead of letting the cat out of the hag by saying that the meat had been kept in aluminum containers he evidently saw to it that the word “metal” was used instead of “aluminum”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But even that opaque method of letting the people have a little item of truth on an important subject will never do, now that the light has begun to shine, and evidently the first edition had not much more than hit the street before somebody in the editorial sanctum was suddenly favored with an illumination. The entire item, headline and all, disappeared entirely, and in its place appeared the following:</span></p>

Only three persons were in the building at the time and none- was injured. Police said racketeers may have thrown the bomb as a ‘scare.’ They said the club is owned by Nick and Peter Prunis, said at one time to have been backers of Texas Guinan.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Toledo, Ohio, the editor of a great paper was fired instanter for letting into the columns of his paper the really important news that food is poisoned by being cooked or allowed to stand in aluminum cooking utensils.

Literally and actually, the time has come when “deep calleth unto deep”, when “day unto day uttereth speech and night unto night showuth knowledge”.

<p><span class="font7">66:1): “The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool.” Heaven is the holy habitation of God. In 1 Timothy 6:16 it is written that no man has seen or ever can see God. The reason is that God is the great Spirit Being and man is a human creature. By His prophet Isaiah (45:12,18) Jehovah declares that He made the earth for man and made man for the earth. God formed man out of the elements of the earth, and hence it is written that man is of the earth and earthy. An earthly creature could not inhabit heaven.</span></p>

There being so many branches and divisions of so-called “organized Christianity”, and desiring to keep the people in the proper attitude, the clergy say to them: Tt matters not to which one of the churches you belong, just so you belong to one. We are all traveling different roads, but to the same goal, and that is heaven.’ This conclusion is based upon the false doctrine of inherent immortality of all souls. The teaching, in substance, is this: that death does not mean cessation of living existence, but merely means the transition from one condition of life on earth to a condition of life either in heaven or in hell. So far as “orthodox” religion is concerned, earth is merely a breeding place or an incubator to produce creatures for one or the other of two places, hell or heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A man of a community who has been successful in business, is a member of some church organization, has rendered public service to the people and contributed large sums of money to the poor, ends his earthly course in death. At his funeral the clergyman unhesitatingly tells those who hear that this man was a good man and that he is not dead but that he has passed immediately into heaven. The people are induced to believe his statement, and many do believe. The statement of the clergyman, however, is wholly unsupported by the Word of God, and is therefore untrue. It misleads the people and gives them entirely a false conception of God’s purpose. If the man just described is classed as a good man and, according to the clergy, goes immediately to heaven, then it follows that heaven must be full of like men who have lived and died. However, the man thus described is not good within the meaning of the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bible shows that Abel, Enoch, Abraham, Isaac and all of God’s prophets received His approval. They died faithful to God. Concerning David, one of these prophets, it is even written that he was a man after God’s own heart. Those men not only did good to the people, but were faithfully devoted to God and to his righteous cause. They all died, but not one of them went to heaven or ever can be in heaven. Some of them died practically 3000 years before Jesus was on earth. According to the teachings of the “orthodox” clergy all of those men must have gone to heaven; and according to the testimony of Jesus, who spoke with authority, not one of them went to heaven. In His conversation with Nicodemus Jesus said (John 3:13): “No man hath ascended up to heaven.” This is conclusive proof that not one of them went to heaven. Even though David was a man after God’s own heart, and had God’s approval, it is written, in Acts 2:34: “David is not ascended into the heavens.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus named John the Baptist as the greatest of all the prophets. God selected John to be the announcer of the Messiah; and John was faithful and true to his commission, and suffered martyrdom because of his faithfulness to God. Concerning John, Jesus said that “he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than John’. (Matt. 11:11) The reason that these good and faithful men did not go to heaven and never can be in heaven is plainly set forth in the Bible and enables one to see clearly what is required to take place before one of the human race can be taken to heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bible is consistent, and every part thereof is in harmony with every other part. The proper* understanding of the Bible makes clear the purpose of Jehovah God. Man is a human creature; and since no human creature can enter heaven, which is the habitation of the spirit creatures, then it follows that a man could not enter heaven without being changed from human to spirit. Jesus spoke with authority, and He said to Nicodemus: “Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. That v.-hich is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the spirit is spirit.” (John 3:3,6) In other words, in order for a man to go to heaven he must be born of the spirit and become a spirit creature. The statement by the clergy and other supporters of “orthodoxy”, that there are many roads leading to heaven, is utterly false and is not supported by any scripture in the Bible. God has pointed out in His Word one way, and just one, by which the man may in due course enter the heavenly realm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Way</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the first man was sentenced to death God announced then and there His purpose to bring forth from His universal organization a seed which would be used as His chief instrument for the establishment of righteousness on earth and to bring man back into harmony with Himself. That seed is made up of those who constitute the heavenly kingdom. The seventh chapter of Revelation is authority for the statement that there will be only 144,000 and One of that specially favored and elect kingdom class. The One is Christ Jesus, and the 144,000 are His associates and members of His body. These will be of the kingdom, while at the same time there will be a great number who will be taken from amongst men and will see the kingdom but not be of it. All of these, however, must be born again, as Jesus told Nicodemus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus became a mam in order that He might he qualified to pay the ransom price and redeem mankind from, death. It was the will of God that Jesus should take this course, and Jesus gladly and faithfully complied with God’s will. In Philippians the second chapter it is recorded that because of His faithfulness to God in the performance of His covenant God raised up Jesus out of death and made Him the Head of the heavenly kingdom class and appointed Him to the position of His Chief Executive Officer for ever. Never before that time was it possible for any man to go to heaven. The man Christ Jesus was the first one to be changed from human to spirit creature; hence it is written of Him. (Col. 1:18,19): “He is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the pre-eminence. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell.” He was the first creature ever to get immortality, and this He was given by Jehovah at His resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Concerning Jesus and His resurrection and appearing in heaven it is written in 2 Timothy 1:10 that He brought life and immortality to light. Before that there was no way open for man to have everlasting life, and no possibility for any man ever to have immortality or ever to get to heaven. These facts are'set forth so plainly in the Scriptures that there is no excuse for any real student of the Bible to be misled concerning the truth thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After His resurrection and ascension into heaven the way was open for man to enter that way for heaven, and then God began to take out from amongst men those who should be associated with Christ Jesus in the kingdom of heaven. Only those who were living on earth at that time or who would live on earth thereafter could possibly be of the heavenly class, and these must meet the conditions or requirements of God before they could be taken to heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A rich ruler came to Jesus and asked Him what he should do to inherit eternal life. He told Jesus that he had been obedient to the law of God in every respect. Jesus then said to the ruler: ‘What you lack now is this: You must sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come and follow me.’ (Luke 18:18-23) What Jesus really meant was that the affection of this man should cease to be attached to things earthly, and his devotion and allegiance should be to God, because that was the course that Jesus took. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To His disciples Jesus said (Matt. 16: 24, 25): “If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.” No mam will do what Jesus here says unless he believes in God and in Christ as the great Redeemer. These scriptures therefore prove that in order for any man ever to make even a start to go to heaven he must first believe that God is the rewarder of those that diligently seek Him and serve Him and that Jesus Christ is the Redeemer and Savior of man, and then he must commit himself to the will of God by agreeing to do God’s will as he learns it. Before he could do these things he must have some faith, and faith comes only by having a knowledge of God’s purposes. To say that a man can believe anything that he wants to and reach heaven is worse than error. It is clearly misleading and destructive of faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The agreement to do God’s will is not made with man; but each individual must make it with the Lord. This agreement is made only by those who have and exercise faith in God and in Christ. If God is pleased to do so He makes a covenant with the one thus showing his faith, and this is called a covenant by sacrifice, because it is an agreement to do God’s will and it leads to the sacrifice of everything that is earthly, and this particularly includes the right of man to live on earth. No man can decide to go to heaven without sacrificing for ever his right to live as a human creature. God then gives His word of promise that such a one shall have the right to live as a spirit creature and, if faithful to his covenant, shall live forever in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In James 1:18 it is written: “'Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that ive should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.” The word “begat” or “begetting” used here means to bring forth and to acknowledge by the Father that the one so brought forth is the son of God. The one thus brought forth is just now starting in the heavenly way. If he faithfully performs his part of the covenant he will receive a complete change in the resurrection from human to spirit life. God considers him a spirit creature from the time he is brought forth, because he must live, if at all, as a spirit creature. Since no human creature can ever be of the heavenly kingdom, it follows, then, that God would not call any human creature to heaven or offer him a place in heaven. All those who are called cr invited by Jehovah to heaven are called after they become the sons of God brought forth as just stated. All these brought forth receive the call, but the Scriptures show that only a few are chosen for the heavenly kingdom. Many do not respond to the call. Those who do not respond to the call by seeking the kingdom are never chosen; but if they still maintain their faith in God and in Christ they may be given life as spirit creatures at the resurrection and -will see the kingdom and be servants in the kingdom, but will never be a part of the heavenly kingdom. Such are designated in Revelation 7 as the “great multitude”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those who do respond to the call for the kingdom and thereafter become unfaithful or lawless suffer everlasting destruction. Those who respond to the call for the kingdom of heaven and devote themselves unequivocally and wholly to God and to His cause, and continue faithful and are found faithful by the great Judge Christ Jesus, are chosen and anointed to perform a special work while on earth; and if this work is done faithfully unto the end such shall be members of,the heavenly kingdom. In this connection Jesus said (Matt. 7:21): “'Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.” It ■would be far safer to take these words of Jesus than to believe the unsupported statement of some clergyman that a man can travel his own way and go to heaven. The plain statement of Jesus is that he must do God’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God’s </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Will</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The will of God man learns from the Bible. Among other things it is written that the will of God is that all who have a part in the heavenly kingdom must overcome the world. To His follow'ers Jesus, in John 16:33, said: “Be of good cheer; I have overcome the ■world.” He told His disciples that they must do likewise and must overcome the world. “The world” means the organization of peoples of the earth -which rule over the earth and which organization is under the supervision and direct influence and control of Satan the Devil. The authority for this statement is found in John 12:31 and 2 Corinthians 4: 3, 4. To “overcome the world” means that one must take his stand on the side of God and His kingdom, be obedient to God’s will, and refuse to have any part in the affairs of the world. It is written, in James 4:4: “Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore ■will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.” “Adultery” is here used in a symbolic manner and means the illicit or wrongful mixing with the things of this world by one who professes to be a Christian. Clearly it means, that the naan who participates in the politics or rulership of this -world, whether he be a clergyman or a financier, and who shows his friendship to the world, cannot be pleasing to God, but is classed as God’s enemy. He might be a very moral man and have a good name and reputation amongst his neighbors; but that is not sufficient. God is selecting from amongst men for heaven only those who will be -wholly devoted to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mere morality, chastity and honesty, and doing good deeds to one’s neighbor, is not a passport into heaven, by any means. The real Christian must be all of this, and much more. He must be entirety for God and for Uis cause, seek to know God’s will as found in His Word, and then faithfully do it. This he accomplishes by faith in Christ Jesus as his Redeemer, and in God as his great Benefactor. Therefore it is •written to the Christian: “This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.” (1 John 5:4) No man will take this course and go on to victory unless he has absolute faith in God. No man can have this faith without some knowledge of God’s way and purpose; and God has but one way, not many ways, and that way is not found in any part • <sup>e</sup> “organized Christianity” on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The clergy claim that often little children or babes go to heaven at death. For the purpose of supporting their contention they cite the words of Jesus written in Mark 10:14: “'Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of God.” Jesus did not say that these little children would be in heaven. This conclusion of the clergy comes from taking a few -words out of their setting and ignoring the context. Other words uttered to the disciples at the same time show that these disciples of Jesus had raised the question as to which one of them would be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. In Matthew 18:2-4 it is stated: “And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, and said, Verity I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.” A little child, therefore, was used as an illustration. A child has complete confidence in and is obedient to its parent. Likewise all those who enter the kingdom of heaven must have complete faith and confidence in God and be wholly obedient to the heavenly Father. This requires one to walk in humility or full submission to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All recognize the fact that a babe has not sufficient mental capacity to make a contract. No one can even start on the vcay to heaven until first he makes a contract or covenant to do God’s will. That contract must be preceded by some knowledge of the ransom price paid by Jesus Christ. The babe could not grasp such knowledge or exercise such faith. The Scriptures therefore plainly show’ that there -will be no babes in heaven. At death the babe goes into the grave, which is property called hell. It is there, unconscious, silent, and out of existence until the resurrection. At the resurrection the Lord will awaken all the babes out of death and give them an opportunity” to grow up to manhood, obey” God, and live on the earth forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Christian 'who ultimately reaches the heavenly kingdom must suffer much opposition and must continue faithful unto God during all opposition and persecution. The reason for that is that Satan, -who is the god of this 'world, violently opposes God and His kingdom. Satan employed divers means to kill Jesus. His chief instrument in the persecution of Jesus was the clergy of that day. Although those clergymen then claimed to represent God on earth they constantly opposed Jesus and persecuted Him; and He told them that they were induced to do so by reason of the influence of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Just after His disciples had been taken into the covenant for the kingdom Jesus said to them, in substance, in John the fifteenth chapter: T am your Master and have chosen you out of the world and therefore the world hates you; the world persecuted me, and it will persecute you also, because the servant must be like the Master.’ These apostles did suffer all manner of persecution, and that persecution came upon them from the clergy” and the fanatical religionists. Amidst all that persecution the disciples were faithful. Paul, one of the faithful apostles, wrote, in 2 Timothy 2:11,12: “It is a faithful say’ing, For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him: if we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny” him, he also will deny us.” Thus he states the condition precedent to entering the kingdom, which is directly” in contradiction of the clergymen’s contention that a man can travel any<sup>7</sup> road. Then Paul adds (2 Tim. 3:11,12): “Persecutions, afflictions, . . . came unto me . . . but out of them all the Lord delivered me. Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Furthermore it is shown by” the Scriptures that those who will be of the heavenly<sup>7</sup> kingdom must be faithful -witnesses of God and of Christ Jesus, making known to others the kingdom of God. Jehovah God is not selecting men merely to get them to heaven. He is taking out a people for His name, which people must be His witnesses while on earth. In Revelation 12:17 it is written that those who faithfully<sup>7</sup> obey<sup>7</sup> the commandments of God are the special targets of Satan the enemy and that to obey the commandments each one of the heavenly kingdom class must be God’s witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Today there are more than 150,000 clergymen in the United States, not a single one of whom is teaching the people of and concerning- God’s kingdom for the relief and blessings of mankind on earth. Today there is a small company of men and women who use all their spare time in going from house to house, especially on Sundays, to inform the people of God’s kingdom and are preaching this good news by exhibiting to the people the printed message in book form. This little company of witnesses are constantly persecuted by the clergymen. Let the people judge from the facts and the scriptures as to whom the clergymen represent, God or the Devil. It was their class that persecuted Jesus. This little company of faithful followers of Christ Jesus, who are witnesses for God and who are being persecuted, are in the class with Christ Jesus. All of such who enter the kingdom of heaven must be faithful unto God even to the very end. To such Jesus said, in Matthew 24:13: ‘rile that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Knowing this, and because of their love for Goel, this little company of faithful men and women are determined to put forth the message of God’s kingdom to the people, regardless of all opposition and persecution. Let the clergy and the courts take notice. This company will go on even at the cost of their lives, because they count not their earthly life dear unto themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ Those who become members of the heavenly kingdom will be changed in the resurrection from human to spirit creatures and then they shall see the Lord and will be granted the great blessing of life divine. To such, and to such only, who thus continue faithful, Jesus, in Revelation 2:10, says: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The clergy have told you that the man who joins any church, pays his dues regularly, lives an honest and decent life, even though he is active in the political and financial affairs of this world, when he dies, goes straight to heaven. The Scriptures show that the clergy have not told you the truth. The belief of a falsehood, even though it brings comfort for a time, results in no lasting good to anyone. The clergy have repeatedly told you that babes at death have gone to heaven. The Scriptures show that they have not told you the truth concerning this. You will find real consolation by learning the truth of God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is the expressed will of God, in 1 Timothy 2: 3, 6, that all men shall be saved and brought to a knowledge of the truth. The salvation for all is provided by and through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. All must then be brought to a knowledge of the truth, that they may have an opportunity to obey and live. The Bible Students are now doing what theyYan to help the people get a knowledge of the truth. The clergy are doing all they can to prevent the people from learning the truth. It is the truth that will make you free and bring you peace of mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Upon this point considered this morning there are two books that you may obtain that will a,id you to get the truth. They set forth the facts, and the Scriptures in support thereof, and show in a simple manner what is the truth. These books are </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation.</span><span class="font7"> The truth as found in God’s Word shorvs that the so-called “good man” who died went to hell! that at death the faithful men including Abel, John the Baptist and all the prophets went to hell, which is the grave. These latter named will, in the resurrection, be brought out of death and given positions of importance on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With Jesus Christ God began the selection of the heavenly kingdom class. The work of selecting and testing His associates is about completed. All of these must die and be resurrected and thereby changed from human to spirit creatures before they can enter heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The truth of and concerning God’s purpose of salvation of men is of vital importance to you. That truth cannot be found anywhere except in the Word of God and in that which explains His Word. Your desire is for life everlasting in hmppiness. A knowledge of God and of His purposes through Christ Jesus leads in the way of endless life in joy. These great and vital truths are set forth in the Bible by God’s holy prophets. All real students have desired to understand prophecy. The due time to understand it is here. Next Sunday, by the Lord’s grace, we will begin the broadcasting of studies in prophecy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">« book, “Prophecy”, gives more clearly than ever before the true reasons why Christian churches have lost their power today. His analysis is brutally unflinching and all the more shocking because it is so largely true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">True Christians have fallen away from the church, he says, because Christian churches have joined the ranks of the Devil. Political organizations, governments, giants of finance and the organized churches are working to-gether*for temporal power, blinding the people to their true ends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">, Churches have opened wide their doors to the money changers whom Christ drove from the temple. Thieves and publicans have been sanctified and entered in. Organized Christianity dabbles in politics, that are not too savory. The church has lost sight of its great mission as a representative of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The church has lost its sacred meaning as a house of worship. Ministers as a class do not seek and tell the truth. They are become blind leaders of the blind. A fearless, godly minister today would draw such a congregation as has never before been seen. The people are weary, distressed, and hungry for true religion in place of the hulls that they are fed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A church is not a social club for sinners. It is a sacred meeting place for those who love and wish to worship God. It is a place where sinners may come only with tears of repentance to seek forgiveness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God’s church is not a place for vulgar display of wealth and influence. The minister is not the servant of his congregation placed in the pulpit for their entertainment. He is a servant of God, speaking from the pulpit to comfort the faithful and to save sinners. If he does not belong in the second class, then he has no place in God’s ministry. He is a fraud, a mock, a dishonor to the great Name, which he seeks to represent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A tremendous burden rests upon God’s anointed people. Those who speak in his name must be above reproach. They must seek and tell the truth for the salvation of His people. There is no earthly reward for these men and women, except the immense happiness of being right with God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No minister has the right to speak from his pulpit unless he tells his congregation the truth without fear or favor. A well known and well meaning minister of this city told us that there are men in his congregation, powerful on his church board, who have no place in any church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I am helpless,” he said. “I cannot do anything about it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is a very fine minister in another city, who found that his treasurer had embezzled $50,000 of the church’s money. This minister would not tolerate the thief’s remaining in charge of the church funds even after restitution had been made. There had been no repentance on the treasurer’s part. In fact, he resented being called to account. Because this minister was true to God’s teachings, the Presbyterian Board transferred him to another and less important church. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If true religion cannot be taught in the churches, if the money changers are hopelessly in charge, then all true ministers of the Word will speak in other houses. They will cry the truth on the street corners, if truth cannot be told in God’s house.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font7"> REMEMBER well how when I was quite young my grandfather used two coarse brushes, one in each hand, with which he brushed his limbs every night before retiring. We lived on a farm, and he was always very active working out in the open, as long as the weather was favorable.

<p><span class="font7">Religion for a Day</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I<a name="footnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark10">2</a></sup></span><span class="font7"><sup></sup> IS surprising how much religious progress can be made in a day. This idea comes mrough glancing at the news items for one day recently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first was a statement at Utica by a Buffalo bishop of the M. E. church that builders of churches should eliminate their local architects and build gorgeous palaces so that the wild youth of our day when they go to church, if they do, may “experience the spirit of God’s presence”. Just why God should make it a point to limit his presence to buildings where high-priced talent has been employed in the design was not explained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No doubt this will cause this III. E. bishop to be loved, more or less, bj- local architects, who will see that he seeks only their spiritual welfare, and is not trying to throw any business their way, to make them rich and bring about their spiritual decay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then there was another item. The Episcopal bishop of Rhode Island, who has also been made presiding bishop of the Episcopal church in the United States, will continue to get along on his regular salary as bishop of Rhode Island. He will not touch the additional salary of $15,000 which w<sup>r</sup>ould have been his in the new job, though he will take over the $5,000 expense money ($100 a week) which shepherds in that job are accustomed to take from the till. As the bishop probably travels in the cars of his wealthy parishioners and is entertained at their homes, this extra $100 a week will be like finding it in the road.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And finally there is a real item of religious news. The board of trustees of Amherst college, one of whom is Calvin Coolidge, and another Dwight L. Morrow, ambassador to Mexico, has decided to drop all religious courses in that institution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Coming events cast their shadows before. In his mind’s eye one sees, dangling from the cupola at Amherst, a grand display of jumpers, overalls, farming implements, Waterburys, Westclox, and all the other paraphernalia which a. more honest generation than the past one will find better suited to their talents than making a living by lying about Almighty God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Heretofore the subscription price of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> magazine mailed to other countries has been $1.50 a year. The new price will, we hope, be a special inducement to people outside the United States to become regular readers of this interesting and worth-while magazine. For all-round instructiveness, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> is second to no magazine published. It places the proper emphasis upon things that are taking place in the world, and incidentally exposes without fear or favor those things in individual and national life that tend to oppress the people. It has no use for shams or hypocrisy. Its news items are brief, instructive, and to the point. Its articles are interesting and wholesome; and finally, and best of all, each issue carries am illuminating talk by Judge Rutherford on the Bible and the fulfilment of its prophecies.</span></p>
