<h2><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Salvagings</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">What Happens to 100<sub>s</sub>000 Men</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">O</span><span class="font6">F 100,000 men born on a given day, 90,757 live to be one year old; 80,129 live to be 27; 64,311 live to be 52; and 32,583 live to be 72. The first year of life is the hardest on the child and the hardest on its parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Tuberculosis Among Young Cotton Workers</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HE figures show that the tuberculosis rate among boys fifteen to nineteen years of age employed in the Fall River (Mass.) cotton mills was nearly double that of boys not so employed, and among girls was far more than double that of girls not so employed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Denmark Sells Its Warship</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">D</span><span class="font6">ENMARK has decided to sell its warship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now if Britain and Uncle Sam and Japan and France and Italy will all do the same thing we shall all be at peace, or we should be unless Germany bought them all, and. then we should have to start all over again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jerusalem’s New Hotel</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HE King David hotel, now building in Jerusalem, will be superior to any other hotel in western Asia or any part of Africa. It is an immense structure, covering nearly or quite an entire city block, and equipped with all modern comforts and conveniences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Germany’s Non-tearable Money</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">G</span><span class="font6">ERMANY’S new money cannot be torn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This result is obtained by spraying the notes with a metal. The new bills are noninflammable and are said to be virtually non-crumpable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Amphibian Tank</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">rpHE amphibian tank being made at Rahway, -*• N.J., will go ten miles an hour in the water, fifty miles on a rough road, and seventy miles an hour on a smooth road. This rambling fortress, as it is called, is supposed to be bombproof and gasproof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Walls One Foot Thick</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HE rooms in which solid carbon dioxid is carried from Tampico to New York have corkboard walls one foot in thickness. This solid dry ice turns back into a gas very slowly, producing intense cold as it does so, as low as 140 degrees below zero, Fahrenheit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Russian Goods in Persia</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font6">T IS said that Russia has about 50 percent of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Persia’s trade and is making it a dumping ground for surplus sugar and for cotton. Russian oil is sold on the Persian Gulf cheaper than that of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which has its own oil fields right on the spot.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Hog’s Sewer System</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font6"> FEW inches above each of a hog’s front feet is an open sore or issue out of which this dirty animal ejects some of the poisons which accumulate in its system. The Lord evidently made no mistake when He designated the hog as unclean. Many hogs are tubercular. In numerous instances their livers are filled with abscesses. Pork eaters often suffer from tapeworm, trichina and cancer.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Devil Worshipers of Paris</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">SPHERE are said to be in the city of Paris twenty-two chapels in which Satan is deliberately worshiped as such, the worshipers expecting as their return a larger share of earth’s good things than would otherwise come to them. There is a split between the cults, one holding that Satan has vanquished God, and the other that he has merely become the first challenger.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Human Vivisection Material</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font6">MAN in Bridgeport, Connecticut, unable to obtain employment, has offered himself as a subject for medical experiment, or, in other words, human vivisection. He merely stipulates that arrangements must be made to care for his wife, to whom he has been wed for the last eleven years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Porto Rico Poor and Sick</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">P</span><span class="font6">ORTO RICO is poor and it is sick. It is so poor that three-fifths of the school children could not go to school if they wanted to, because there are no schools for them. The death rate is four and a half times what it is in the United States. Poverty and a high death rate always go hand in hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Strikers Make a Success of Business</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">rpWO years ago 250 strikers left the clothing making firm of David Adler and Sons Co.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">and rented a factory at which they made up clothing on contract for Hart, Schaffner and Marx of Chicago. They have made a complete success of their business and their old employers have discontinued operations. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Cost of Steamer Operation</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">QOME idea may be had of the great cost of steamer operation when it is learned that a round trip of the Bremen, the world’s fastest boat, costs in the neighborhood of $625,000. Such a boat must go loaded on every trip, winter and summer, or prove a financial burden to its owners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Anti-Fascisti Fleeing Italy</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A Temporary Solution of the Wheat Tangle</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font14">S</span><span class="font6">EVERAL groups of Italian anti-Fascisti TTTITH large wheat crops all over the world, have recently fled from the unbearable ’ » American bins full, and farmers being</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">tyranny of the Mussolini forces that now have Italy in slavery. Even women and little children have fled over mountain passes ten thousand feet above sea level in order to escape. One woman broke her leg on a glacier, but was rescued; another young woman died in a raging blizzard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Free Speech on Strikes</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">C</span><span class="font6">ONGRESS can make no law abridging freedom of speech, but according to Mr. Green, president of the American Federation of Labor, the Federation is at times forbidden to publish the fact that strikes are in progress, forbidden to discuss strikes, and even forbidden to talk over strikes that are in progress. No doubt these prohibitions come fro i federal judges who have placed their decisions above the Constitution, the supreme law of the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Slavery in the Congo</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HE charge is made that the Belgian government, which, in a way, was the center of the great war that was to make the world safe for democracy, is so cruel in its rule of the poor blacks in the Congo region that they are forcibly recruited for public labor even when they are in a dying condition, and that the mor-paid more for wheat than it would bring in open market, the government was compelled to ask them to plant less. But now the unprecedented drought is showing a way'out. Wheat has fallen so low that it can now be profitably fed to stock, and as only about half the corn is maturing it is almost necessary to use it in that way.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">tality rates among these poor blacks are almost . to see that the profit system is doomed, because equal to Belgium’s casualty rates during the it is bringing ruin to the workers, and thus to</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sound Sense from Owen D. Young</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">O</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">wen D. Young says: “What shall we do with our surplus wheat or cotton, or what you please? We must get rid of it. There are only two ways. Either we must burn it at home or sell it abroad. If America starts to burn surplus wheat when people are hung*ry elsewhere in the world, that fire will start a conflagration which we cannot stop. There is no way out except to market this surplus where men are hungry and where men are underclothed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Stomachs Empty While Wheat Piles Up</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HE London </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font6"> says: “Stomachs remain empty while wheat piles up in the elevators, and farmers dread a too good harvest. And as goods accumulate and men decay, production must be artificially restricted. Unemployment grows. Purchasing power declines again. The vicious circle widens.” Everybody is beginning all. God’s kingdom alone will solve this difficulty.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Racketeering in New York</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font6">T IS estimated that in the last eighteen months clothing manufacturers in New York city have paid Yvo million dollars to racketeers who have offered to provide them with protection against the demands of labor organizations. The manufacturers are afraid not to pay. Evidence of this form of blackmail is now in the hands of the New York district attorney.</span></p>

New York in the same time had 357 murder and manslaughter cases, or more than seven times as many. The only satisfaction we have is that conditions in Chicago are still worse.</span></p>

Berries dried on the bushes. Farmers parted with pigs for 50c or $1 and with cattle for $2, because they had nothing to give them. In Ohio a whole community of 200 farmers descended upon a road construction camp and demanded work, so that they might have means to keep their families alive, and they got the work, too. Milch cows, in Ohio, lacking pasturage, have ceased to furnish milk.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Mr. Greer Objects to Funeral</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">TV/Tk. Robert J. Greer, of Atlantic City, re-1VJL turned home the other day, and objected strenuously to the preparations that were being made for his funeral. While these objections no doubt included the item of expense involved, the principal objection which he had to offer was that he was not dead, and the person they had in the coffin and which they had identified as him was not he himself, but somebody else. Naturally, if a man is going to pay his own funeral expenses, and live to see the bill receipted, he wants to make sure that it is he himself and not some stranger that is getting all the attentions.</span></p>

Six million men will be instructed in aerial and chemical defense, and 5,500,000 women will be given courses in elementary military science, gas warfare and Red Cross nursing.

<p><span class="font6">Corn Sugar </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By BI. E. Coffey (Texas)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font6">j^OR our health's sake we should give due consideration to the foods we eat. An attempt is made in the following discussion of corn sugar to convey to the mind of the reader a correct understanding of what this name did mean and its meaning as generally applied today. I take liberty also to digress from a strict adherence to theme subject in order to bring to light facts which the public deserve to know’ in reference to several foodstuffs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Corn Sugar and Corn Syrup in History</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Before the rediscovery of America by Columbus the Aztecs and other people of America, were manufacturing corn sugar and corn syrup. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Universal Encyclopedia and Atlas</span><span class="font6"> (1895) says: “Humboldt reported, in an account of his visit to Mexico, that before the arrival of the Europeans, the Mexicans, as well as the Peruvians, pressed out the sap in the maize stalks and by concentration thereof prepared sugar, and Cortez reported to Charles V that the Mexicans had for sale honey, wax, sirup and sugar from the maize stalks, which were as sweet as sugar cane. From the maize grown in Germany in 1766 Justi obtained a fairly good sugar, and in Italy in 1748 Jacquin and Mara-belli erected a mill for pressing maize stalks and succeeded in making sugar therefrom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On pages 138, 139, volume 1, of Prescott’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">History of Mexico</span><span class="font6"> is given an interesting description of the corn sugar industry of early America. I quote: “The great staple of the country, as, indeed, of the American Continent, was maize, or Indian corn which grew freely among the valleys and up the steep sides of the tableland. The Aztecs were as curious in its preparation, and as well instructed in its manifold uses, as the most expert New England housewife. Its gigantic stalks, in these equinoctial regions, afford a saccharine matter not found to the same extent in northern latitudes, and supplied the natives with sugar not inferior to that of the cane itself, which was not introduced among them until after the conquest.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A paper written by Governor Winthrop of Massachusetts was published in 1678 in the “Philosophical Transactions”, Royal Society of Great Britain, a part of which states: “A sirup as sweet as sugar may be made of it, as has been often tried. And meats sweetened with it have not been distinguished from the like sweetened with sugar. Trial may easily be made, whether it will not be brought to crystallize or shoot into a saccharine powder, as the juice of sugar cane.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Until recent years producers of corn sugar and corn syrup were to be found in a number of agricultural localities. As an example I mention Mr. F. L. Stewart, of Murraysville, Pennsylvania, who as late as 1904 exhibited at the Louisana Purchase Exposition samples of coni sugar and corn syrup from his factory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">History of a Sugar Falsely Called Corn Sugar</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The chemical name for sugar made from the juices of the cornstalk, or from sugar cane, or from beets, is sucrose. Maple sugar is also sucrose, and honey is chiefly dextrose and levulose, with about 8 percent sucrose and containing a minute amount of other substances. Corn sugar as the name applies today is entirely dextrose. It is manufactured chiefly from corn starch by the catalytic action of hydrochloric acid on the starch grains. Hence a more appropriate name for it would be “starch sugar”. The same kind of sugar (dextrose) can be (and has been) made from the starch of the potato, cassava, rice, sorghum grains and other plant starches. Ordinary wood cellulose can be treated with concentrated acids to form the same kind of sugar (dextrose).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Credit for the discovery of the process for converting starch into dextrose by means of acids belongs to a Russian chemist of German ancestry named Gottlob Kirchof, who made the discovery in 1806 and revealed it to the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences in 1812. His government bestowed a life pension on him for this service. Interest was keen in Kirchof’s discovery during Napoleon’s blockade of continental Europe. On the overthrow of Napoleon interest quickly subsided. Resumption of normal commerce came rapidly and the beet sugar industry developed rapidly in France and Germany, which further lessened interest in the discovery. Detailed information and many other facts and history are to be found in a book published by Dr. H. Wichelhaus, at Leipzig, and entitled </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Der Starkezucker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some sixty-five years ago Dr. F. W. Goerling organized the Union Sugar Company in New York for manufacturing s<sup>+</sup>arch sugar and starch syrup under a new process patented by him, but the enterprise was not a lasting success. About 1880 Chicago manufacturers invested a million dollars in a corn sugar factory which was a failure, but in New York city about the same time Matthiessen and Wichers began manufacturing starch sugar and starch syrup under directions of the chemist Dr. Arno Behr and were successful commercially.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is to a large extent due to Dr. Behr’s discoveries that corn is used so extensively today in producing starch, dextrose, commercial glucose, maize oil, gluten feed, etc. Although millions of dollars were spent in the attempt it was not until 1923 that the Bureau of Standards, Washington, succeeded in producing from corn starch a sugar (dextrose) chemically more than 99.9 percent pure and of clear white crystalline appearance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The bureau claimed to have dedicated its discovery to the public good. It sent Mr. W. B. Newkirk to perform some experiments at the factory of the Corn Products Refining Company. Mr. Newkirk demonstrated his ability to make dextrose of high quality from corn starch. Subsequently the Corn Products Refining Company offered him a large salary and he left the services of the government. He then took out patents covering the process of manufacturing crystallized dextrose. Whether or not any of these patents cover processes discovered in the Bureau of Standards has never been divulged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Today the Corn Products Refining Company have a practical monopoly of the manufacture of sugar from corn starch. Pennick &amp;&nbsp;Ford are a subsidiary of this company (Corn Products Refining Company), and other independent companies have come under its control. The reader may judge how well the discoveries of the Bureau of Standards benefit the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The New Com Sugar Described</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The new factory-made corn sugar (starch sugar) is not found in nature, but dextrose is found in the blood stream of man and- other animals. Because the new sugar differs in chemical properties from ordinary cane sugar it cannot be substituted wholly or in part for cane sugar. Corn sugar is only four-fifths as heavy as cane sugar and from one-half to three-fourths as sweet as cane sugar. It has been found that when corn sugar is heated with a mild alkali, as hard water or sweet milk, the product (bakery goods, or what not) develops a slightly bitter taste and becomes rather dark in color.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the new sugar caramelizes at a lower temperature than cane sugar, it is not satisfactory for candy brittles. These facts are gleaned from Bulletin 92 of the Iowa State College of Agriculture. Corn sugar is less soluble than cane sugar, and this is found to be a great disadvantage in preparing many foods. Jams, jellies and the like made with corn sugar have been found to be inferior in quality and appearance. This fact is certified to by the National Preservers Association.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">How a Great Fraud Was Perpetrated</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Before the enactment of the Pure Food Law the new corn sugar was called “grape sugar” (dextrose), and syrup made from starch was called “glucose”. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Glylcys,</span><span class="font6"> from which the word “glucose” is derived, is a Greek word meaning “sweet”. Back in 1898 when it was opposing the mixed flour law, passed in that year, the present Corn Products Company went under the name “Glucose Sugar Refining Company”. Glucose sugar would be an appropriate name for the present corn sugar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After the enactment of the pure food law the Corn Products people desired to have the name “corn syrup” applied to their glucose syrup. In 1907 their Mr. Bedford wrote the Board of Food and Drug Inspection: “We are advised by our attorneys that in their opinion the courts would uphold us in the use of the title ‘Corn Sirup’, but we do not want to seek relief in that way. We hope to get it from your honorable body.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the same year Dr. Harvey AV. Wiley, in a statement to the secretary of agriculture said: “The term ‘sirup’ means a sirup which is eaten on the table and which can only be made from the juice of sugar-producing plants according to the official standards and according to its accepted and common meaning. Thus glucose (commercial) could not possibly, with any ethical or legal right, be known as corn sirup. The only reason for wanting to use the name is to deceive the purchaser. True corn sirup has been made in this country in large quantities as far back as the Revolutionary War, and espe-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">daily in large quantities in the decade between 1840 and 1850, as the records of the Patent Office, which at that time published the agricultural reports, will show. The term ‘corn sirup’ can therefore apply only to the product obtained from the saccharine juices of the maize stalk. To designate glucose under the name of ‘corn sirup’ is a violation of all the ethical and legal principles on which the enforcement of the food and drugs acts is based, as well as the plain letter of the law itself.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Under the federal Food and Drugs Act the only office in the United States with authority to decide whether an article is adulterated or misbranded is the Bureau of Chemistry. In 1907 this bureau decided that under the law “corn sirup” when used to designate glucose was a misbranding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When proof of this decision was read to Mr. Roosevelt, who was president at the time, he assumed a false authority which he did not possess and ordered the secretary of agriculture to change the decision of the Bureau of Chemistry, The Bureau of Chemistry could not be convinced that it was wrong, even by the president and the secretary of agriculture, and in order to make the act of the president appear legal the committee referred to at the beginning of this paragraph as the Board of Food and Drug Inspection was appointed. This committee has by law no right to exist. It was given authority by the president to make decisions over the Bureau of Chemistry, and the name ‘corn sirup’ was now legalized (apparently) when applied to glucose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the time that this great fraud was perpetrated the Bureau of Chemistry had, from extensive experiments on young men, come to the conclusion that the use of sulphur fumes in preserving and refining foods was injurious to the health. Thus the food manufacturers who used sulphur and other injurious chemicals combined with the Corn Products Company and had the president, by executive edict, repeal certain activities of the Bureau of Chemistry which determined whether or not in certain cases a food product was adulterated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Remsen Board of Consulting Scientific Experts (an illegal board) was appointed to investigate certain subjects anew, and during its period of activity all activities of the Bureau of Chemistry in control of certain food adulterants was forbidden—among them sulphur dioxide, benzoate of soda, sulphate of copper, saccharine and alum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This illegal body, after several years of investigation (?), came to the conclusion (which they probably had at the beginning) that the use of sulphur fumes, benzoate of soda, and alum were entirely harmless. The reader may judge as to how far the welfare of the consumer has been neglected and the law overridden to satisfy the greed of selfish food trusts and the lust of public officials for gold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Corn Sugar Fraud Attempt</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not satisfied with the millions they have amassed since the corn sirup fraud the Corn Products Trust are now seeking to have the legislative branch of the United States government modify the provisions of the Pure Food Law that they may accumulate even more millions at the people’s expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since 1926 and earlier they have been seeking to put through Congress an amendment to the Food and Drugs Act which would allow the use of corn sugar in other foodstuffs ’without this fact’s being made known on the label. Thus canned fruits in which cane or beet sugar is usually the sweetening agent would be sweetened with corn sugar (dextrose) and there would be nothing on the label to inform the consumer of the fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The new sugar would be used in canned milk and in preserves, jellies, etc., without the consumer’s being the wiser. Maple syrup and honey could be made to contain fifty percent or more of the new sugar without the consumer’s being-able to detect the adulteration, since there would be no label declaration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In defense of this newest proposed fraud which the representatives of the people themselves are being requested to legalize it is claimed the corn growers of the United States would be immensely benefited. It is claimed that all the surplus of corn (or a large part of it) could be converted into sugar and consumed in place of cane sugar which is imported and that the raise in the price of corn would benefit the producer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Corn Growers Association was represented as favoring this legislation. It was found on investigation that this Association was composed of about twelve corn sugar people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1928, when the second corn sugar bill was introduced in Congress, Dr. William R. Catheart, of the Com Products Refining Company, wrote a booklet which was represented on the title page as an address delivered by him at the meeting of the American Farm Bureau Federation in Chicago, December 7,1927. A letterhead of the Bureau was reproduced on the first inner cover page, and a letter, supposed to have been written by a high official of the Bureau, in which it was stated that the Bureau supported the corn sugar bill. But the records of the Bureau meeting referred to show that Dr. Cathcart was present </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">but not permitted to deliver his address </span><span class="font6">and that the Bureau </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">refused</span><span class="font6"> to endorse the corn sugar bill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In April, 1929, when the third corn sugar bill was introduced in Congress, it was heralded as a farm relief measure. The comments of sane thinkers on this proposed relief measure indicate that the relief claim is false. The Lincoln </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">State Journal</span><span class="font6"> says, “For entertainment and whatever else it may be worth, this 'eat more corn’ movement is good enough, but as a remedy for agricultural depression it cannot seriously count. Whoever eats more of the corn farmer’s product must eat less of some other farm product.” The Milwaukee </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font6"> states, “If everybody substitutes hominy for wheat cereals and corn bread for wheat bread, what is going to happen to the wheat farmers? You cannot more force canners to use corn sugar than you can compel the general public to ‘eat a corn sugar lollypop a day’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1928 Mr. Chester A. Gray, head of the legislative department of the American Farm Bureau Federation, was bitterly opposed to the corn sugar bill, but it now<sup>T</sup> happens, in the year 1930, that Mr. Gray is supporting the bill. Though the Bureau has never endorsed the corn sugar legislation fraud it is represented as endorsing it by corn sugar representatives, and thus the American farmer is represented as willing to take business away from himself and turn it over to great food factories. Those interested in current developments will be interested to observe during this year whether or not the second great fraud with reference to a corn starch product is perpetrated and the health of the people further undermined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Is the Pure Food Law a Benefit?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the passage of the corn sugar bill mentioned in the foregoing would mean the beginning of the downfall of the Pure Food Law, it might be well to inquire whether or not the law is beneficial to the people. Conditions existing before 1906 would indicate that it is beneficial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Back in 1812 surgeon Mann recorded that flour rationed out to soldiers in northern New York was adulterated with plaster of Paris and produced diarrhea and other gastrointestinal affections. During the Civil War a contractor was arrested for selling an extract of coffee which was so adulterated as to seriously injure the health of the soldiers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Records of samples of baking powder before 1906 show that they contained about 30 percent pulverized rock. Jams made from summer squash, white turnips and glucose sirup were sold which were made palatable with artificial extracts. There were fruit jellies made from animal jelly, glucose and artificial colors. Most jams were adulterated with cannery refuse, clover seeds, glucose and artificial flavors. Milk, in addition to having all the cream removed and its volume increased by water, was also adulterated with chalk and dirt. Butter was increased in volume by the addition of animal jelly. Maple syrup was made of ordinary syrup with a few ounces of hickory bark added and was difficult to distinguish in flavor from the genuine article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These are only a few examples of adulterations which were practiced extensively before 1906. It is true that many other deceptions and adulterations have been practiced since the law of 1906 went into effect, but on the whole it has been of considerable protection to the general public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Corn Sugar in the Future</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It will be seen by observation as well as common experience that man has been able to do little to benefit his present condition, because of prevailing selfishness and the unseen power for evil, Satan. Now, under the increasing light of earth’s rightful Ruler, Christ, fraud and wrongdoing are being brought to light. We may be sure that, in time, under the reign of the Prince of Peace every article of food will be known by a name by which the consumer can distinguish its true source and properties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If the “new corn sugar” continues to be regarded as a useful article of food everyone will know that it is manufactured from starch and will not confuse it with sugars from the juices of plants. There will be no deceptions under Christ’s rulership. No greedy conspiracies will</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">be permitted against the health of the people, health; for the prophet assures us, &quot;They shall It will not be possible for people to unwittingly not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain purchase and consume foods injurious to the [kingdom].”—Isa. 11:9.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">N</span><span class="font6">OT many men have just missed<sup>!</sup>being a billionaire, but that is seemingly true of Q. A.

It was not until 1876 that Dr, Bell’s invention was announced to the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of Interest to Flower Enthusiasts </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Malcolm Rolls (California)</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> No. 282, it occurred to me that perhaps those who are flower enthusiasts ■would like to have seeds of some of our California wild flowers. We have a great number of very lovely flowers and I should be glad to send those who really would get pleasure from them a few seeds of our wild Penstemon, a beautiful deep purple, tubular bloom growing on large stalks three to five feet high. Others might also be gotten without much effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I know these would bring a great deal of happiness which perhaps those receiving might like to abundantly repay in the form of a few of their native floAver seeds.

<p><span class="font6">History of the Dahlia </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By E. H. Gloege (Wisconsin)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">U</span><span class="font6">NDER the title of &quot;The Flower of the Field”, appearing in the July 9 issue of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font6"> on page 647, under the heading of “Dahlia”, I find the statement that the dahlia “was not introduced into Europe until 1879”. Possibly this is a typographical error, with the 7 and 8 reversed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The dahlia was introduced from Mexico into Spain in 1789, and then into England. These plants were lost and the dahlia (named after the Swedish botanist Dahl) was reintroduced into Europe in 1804, this time into England, and from these plants and others introduced subsequent to 1815 the present British stock originated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I do not know when it was introduced into Germany, but as early as 1826 it was grown there by my grandfather, Frederick Gloege, and as early as 1848 by my father, Herman L. Gloege. Grandfather grew the dahlia uninterruptedly for sixty-three years with nine previous years to add, or a total of seventy-two years. Both first grew it in Germany and later in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The family of Gloege has now grown the dahlia without an interruption for 104 years, thirty-four in Germany and seventy here. The bulletin of “The American Dahlia Society” for April, 1926, (Series VII, No. 36, p. 34) gave this story, more elaborated: A challenge for a longer record, after more than four years, remains unanswered,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I do not know if a correction in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden, Age</span><span class="font6"> would be of much consequence, but I am giving you this bit of information to correct the statement as given. Should you consider it worth -while you are at liberty to use as much or as little of this letter of correction as you see fit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I enjoy </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> for the information it contains, information that is brief and to the point and not found in any other publication.

<p><span class="font6">Doodle Bug Operation </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By H. 'A. Scott (California')</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">D</span><span class="font6">OODLE Bug Operation is the means used by science to answer commercialism’s question: Where did the Creator bury His oil sands? The Hmde used to designate the operation came from the tiny craters excavated by the larvae of the winged ant lion. This larvae and his immature craters in the loose sand are universally known to the childhood of the southwest as doodle bugs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Who has not seen children armed with a cigar box with a little sand investigating crater after crater hunting for the interesting little chap who has the power to throw out the sand, comparatively equal to a man with a steam shovel?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The object of Mr. and Mrs. Winged Ant Lion’s baby is to make a pitfail to catch some unwary little ant. And if any ant ventures to look over the brink of one of these little pitfalls, he is apt to feel the sand slipping under his feet and to start on a downward course that is sure to end in his destruction; for baby winged ant lion awaits him at the apex of his little inverted cone-shaped excavation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Both the small excavations and the “shell” hole blown out by the dynamite charge are sim-. ilar to craters of the doodle bug. The trucks used by the scientists have a strange resemblance to giant beetles of the tumblebug type as they wind their way through sagebrush of the trackless desert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The theory upon which doodle bug operations are based may be readily understood by the example of the drum. A stroke on the head of the drum; stroke two will result in vibrations far different from those resulting from a stroke on the edge of the drum; stroke one again; if a golf ball be dropped on a pavement, the concussion will be greater, but the rebound will be far greater in the case of the rubber ball. If a number of dynamite strokes be given the great earth oil drum, simultaneously the vibrations resulting would be much like those observed when shaking a run, provided the stroke is given the head of the oil drum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Possibly if the stroke was given on solid ground near the edge of oil sand the reverse would be true. In that case the vibrations would be short and fast but would lengthen relatively to the distance from the solid until they would subside into great swells like the ripples resulting from a stone dropped into the water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">More than a Chinese puzzle to most people is the proven fact that the earth crust moves like the swells in the ocean, but examples of the great oil drums filled with plastic oil sand will help to comprehend this phenomenon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Earth oil drums are sometimes ten miles long, and often several miles wide and as much as 200 feet in thickness. A map of a series of these oil pools in California, known as the Taft and Colinga oil fields, resembles the map of our great lakes on the Canadian border; and they extend from southeast to northwest for more than a hundred iiiiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The scientists carrying on these operations mind their own business and say little. They have no evidence of their work except little holes about the size of the crown of your hat, and occasionally a series of shell holes about eight or ten feet across. The small holes are marked by small white flags backed to lath. These, together with section corners marked with higher white and red flags, make one think some surveying party has been by. The little flags are seen here and there, sometimes on top of a hill, sometimes dotting desert slopes that extend far out from the foothills into the lowlands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The doodle bug operations are very extensive and cover many hundreds of square miles. A big foreign company recently purchased 6,000 acres near McKittrick, Calif., on the strength of these operations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The equipment used is interesting. Four types of truck and cars are used: a touring car, a truck and delivery body, a dandy little boring machine mounted on the rear of a small truck, and a truck carrying reels of cable used in detonating the charges of dynamite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The discovery of oil by experimental methods is very expensive and not always successful, and frequently not profitable. A rig (the name given to an oil derrick) and equipment cost from $60,000 to $100,000. Forty thousand feet of lumber is used in a derrick. For safety, they use from three to five big steam boilers to furnish power for the drilling operations. Fishing in a 3,000-foot well is a very expensive operation. Frequently a string of tools breaks away, and in one case tvco years have been spent in fishing without results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sometimes a crooked hole gives much trouble; 500 feet from the perpendicular is the greatest variation recorded. At one well at Young Beach, Calif., the hole came out in another well. With</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">the expensive difficulties to face, it is better to know your oil and drill afterwards; and science answers your inquiries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What a day of rejoicing when earth’s millions may have the benefit of all of God’s heritage to men and all the accumulated knowledge of past ages will be available for their use! No hidden thing, no lost art, no inefficiency, no possibility of failure, no accidental mishap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Stuff and nonsense!” you say! Not a bit of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are soon to see perfect men on earth: perfect bodies crowned with perfect minds; any less would not be perfect. Imperfect work results from imperfect workmen. The new Ruler of earth is a Master; He has never had a failure and never made a mistake; nor will those perfect ones who are the workmanship of His hands. The wonders of the coming age will open to them, and in turn they will give freely and man will rejoice in the benefits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our Insane Medium of Exchange</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">T NOTE the items “Holding Companies Will A Dominate Railroads” and “General Electric Stock Splitting”. Such actions are made possible by the fact that how long one person is to work for another is determined on some </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">other </span><span class="font6">basis than that of hour-for-hour exchange of human work. And the fact that prices are so fixed that some are </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">forced</span><span class="font6"> to work for others longer than others work in return, produces an incentive on the part of those in a position to get worked for without working in return, to</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">get just as great a duration of work from others as possible without themselves having to work for anyone. The wrong method of transferringhuman work produces incentives -which cause humans to act in a manner injurious in one way or another both to others and to themselves.

<p><span class="font6">Poltergeist in Southern France</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font6">N ITEM in the Philadelphia </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Record</span><span class="font6"> gives details of a case of “Poltergeist” at Roclie-piquee in southern France. “Poltergeist” is the work of demons, a positive proof of their existence. The report shows that the local authorities know something of the phenomena, but nothing as to their cause. The most interesting paragraphs of the story follow:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The phenomena consist in face-slapping by invisible hands. Any man or woman who ventures to approach the cottage of Jean Rozier receives a stinging-slap in the face without seeing his aggressor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The impartiality and thoroughness of the invisible slapper have filled even the veteran gendarmes with superstitious terror. Police commissaries, professors, hundreds of curious and skeptical visitors, including newspaper men, have all had a biff in the face.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In addition there has been an equally baffling rain of stones on the humble little dwelling. There are constant nocturnal noises in the garret which shake the place like the roll of thunder. Furniture is upset, doors are slammed, beds unmade, and two of the watch dogs have been mysteriously killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The most puzzling, and at the same time most cruel peculiarity of the manifestations, is the fact that the peasant’s little children often wake up with screams of alarm and are found to have their faces bleeding as if they have been scratched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The savants, after a thorough investigation, declare that it is the most baffling and sensational case of so-called “poltergeist” that has come to their attention for many years. Such occurrences, Professor Bidet, of Paris, said, are by no means infrequent in rural regions, but he admitted never having witnessed any case of similar violence and duration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“We know,” he said, “that the phenomena have to do with Rozier’s 13-year-old daughter. This our investigation has established definitely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It’s often a young girl who is the center and perhaps the cause of such baffling occurrences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“There is no doubt of the invisible slapping. I have received a stinging whack myself, and I know this won’t happen if the girl is absent from the house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“But who performs the humiliating trick, and how it is done, remains a mystery in this case, as in all the hundreds of similar cases in rural France that have come to my attention.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Massachusetts Doctors to Assist God</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">F</span><span class="font6">EELING that babies, as they are made by the Creator, are not really fit to enter upon the privileges of this life until after the medical profession have adequately poisoned their blood with vaccine pus, George H. Bigelow, state public health commissioner of Massachusetts, is introducing a bill in the Massachusetts legislature that would require vaccination of all infants before the end of the first year and revaccination early in their school life. Mr. Bigelow says: “This is the solution of smallpox, rather than vaccination clinics after disease has sickened many, closed schools and disrupted the economic life of the community.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">\V. B. Fowler, of that state, the proud father of some bright children, is very enthusiastic about the Bigelow plan, and breaks forth into eloquence in the following manner:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Dr. Bigelow’s concern for the welfare of the people is so great that really it is most touching. Most touching’ 1! In fact one can almost see him pacing back and forth in his office wringing his hands and weeping great (crocodile) tears because of the “disrupted economic life of the community”, due solely to the fact that so many careless people have not been vaccinated for thirty years or more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order that business (for the doctors) 'might not be interrupted it is now proposed to vaccinate all infants before they reach the age of one year. Then to be doubly assured that business (for the medics) will be maintained on a sound basis it is proposed to repeat the performance “early in their school life”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Shades of Pharaoh I! Must the slaughter of the innocents be repeated? It surely will be if this unscrupulous hound has his way, and since Massachusetts is the cradle of liberty (for the medical profession) it looks as though Dr. Bigelow and his gang of medical thugs would carry the day with flying colors. The lamentation and bitter weeping of Rachel in Ramah centuries ago will be duplicated in Massachusetts a thousand fold when the legislators on Beacon Hill put this piece of legislation on the statute books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Oh, for ten thousand Albert W. Peacocks in this state who with the courage of their convictions will ■ go to prison if need be in order to arouse the people of this commonwealth to the awfulness of the calamity that will surely fall upon them, not because of smallpox epidemics, but because of the insane desire of the medical doctors to force their ideas upon the people for no other reason except that the business life of the community “must not be interrupted”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Business in most lines is bad, I’ll admit. Evidently the glorious light of the new day of life, liberty and happiness for all mankind is making business in the medical profession so bad that the doctors are in mortal terror of being compelled to earn an honest living as some of the rest of us have to do. (Ecclesiastics excepted, of course.) Commissioner Bigelow’s proposed legislation manifests a panicky state of mind that is almost pitiful. Well, he is “loyal to the profession”, anyway, and that is something.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thank God that earth’s rightful ruler, the Great Physician, is now about to put an end to the horrible practices of Satan’s counterfeit physicians by giving poor suffering humanity health and curing all their diseases; not by polluting their blood stream with the pus of a diseased animal, but by cleansing their inward parts with His Word of Truth, and writing His law upon their hearts! Thon the inhabitants of the land shall not say, “I am sick,” but the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah will fill the whole earth with joy and gladness and give the people perfect health. .</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">TpOR nearly three years I have been having -®- a morning brush, and, combined with other health measures, such as diet and exercise, etc., have been benefited a great deal; and my skin is rougher and healthier than before I started the morning brush. I use a large, stiff brush and brush from the wrists to the shoulders, then from my feet upward, finishing around the heart, the idea being to get the large blood vessels working. This dry friction also helps the lungs and kidneys by making the skin do its part of the elimination process of the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mr. Rolls should try brushing his own spine, as the exercise would be good for him; my wife offered to brush that part of my anatomy for me, but I found with practice that I could manage it myself, and, as I have said, the exercise is good.

<p><span class="font6">An aluminum shaker can be purchased at almost any hardware store. Place a pint of sweet cream in the shaker, shake for fifteen minutes, remove the cover, smell it, let it stand for five hours in the shaker, and drink it; also note the color. If the patient lives to tell the story the next day he will be indeed fortunate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The cooking of tomatoes, rhubarb, apple sauce, etc., in an old soiled dish will have such a powerful chemical action in five minutes that all of the oxidized surface will be removed. The aluminum companies admit that in this case they are real lightning workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A gentleman called yesterdaj^ who did not want to be quoted in the matter, but he stated that one of the manufacturers or owners of an extensive aluminum manufacturing plant had admitted that aluminum ware is poisonous, but that they were gracefully changing over to the manufacture of stainless steel and that the sales had also fallen off to such an extent that it had become a serious objection to the further manufacture of aluminum ware.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">T. B. Tested Milk </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By M. L. Ritchie (Pennsylvania)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">issue of February 17 contains a little -d- article stating a few facts about milk. The writer shows how the pure milk taken from the cow is skimmed and reduced in butter fat before being served to city customers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is indeed a deplorable state of affairs; but if the skimming of milk were the only way the users of this most health-giving food were humbugged and robbed it would be a very trifling thing compared with some other deceptions put over on the consumers of milk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The biggest fraud practiced in the milk business is one which claims to be a great benefit to the milk-consuming public. (This is the way the Devil always operates.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The innocent, unsuspecting city milk customer buys a bottle of milk bearing the label “T.B. tested”. Now they think they have something and willingly part with a few extra cents a quart for such milk. They little realize what “T.B. tested” means. I honestly believe that this T.B. test of cows is one of the biggest deceptions practiced on the human family at this time, so far as their food is concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If the consumers of milk could realize that a T.B. tested herd of cows means a herd that has had the poisonous serum pumped into their blood stream from time to time until their systems become so thoroughly saturated with this deadly poison that they become immune to it; if they knew that the cow which really is in the last stages of T.B. is invariably passed by this so-called test and left on the farm, and the healthy, producing cows are killed off; and that a cow’s milk directly after having this poison pumped into the blood stream is not fit for hog feed and would act better for rat poison than many of the preparations intended for this purpose: then they would not be so ready to part with their good money to help keep up this gigantic deception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Alum and Chlorine in the Water Supply</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font6"> WISH to talk to you about </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">alum</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">chlorine, </span><span class="font6">used in the city drinking water, perpetuated in United States aqueducts by prejudices and involuntary deviation from truth. In the name of humanity you must have courage to enlighten the people and your neighbors to the dangers of such scourge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">According to Dr. Betts, the humanitarian physician of Toledo, and the most efficient and conscientious health officials, alum is recognized and conceded to be a poisonous substance capable of producing serious and even fatal results when taken into the system. It is poisonous, irritating and astringent, directly injurious or may split up into objectionable compounds. No salt of aluminum is a food product in itself; neither is it a natural constituent of the human body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If, according to Parke Davis &amp;&nbsp;Co., alum is a powerful astringent, for it causes animal tissue to contract, and rarely must be used internally, why is it to be taken daily in the water?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If alum is astringent and has styptic properties, if alum is soluble in water and is used as an emetic and locally in solution in conjunctivitis, laryngitis, leucorrhea and ulcers; if it is a medicine, why is it used daily in water ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Alum, according to Dr. Clark’s materia med-iea, affects the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">anus.</span><span class="font6"> Then the patients who have syphilis will have cancer of the rectum, diarrhea ichorous, mixed with blood of an offensive odor, with great exhaustion, masses of coagulated blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Alum produces paralytic states, hoarseness and bronchial affections.

<p><span class="font6">Dr. A. 1I.

In Washington, D. C., this idea originated. I believe the Public Health Service was sponsor for it. It was broadcast and printed in the newspapers about the wonderful cures that chlorine gas was making and a great public interest was awakened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘■'But shortly the New York clinics discontinued these treatments as being </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">injurious to the general health of the patients;</span><span class="font6"> even though the catarrhal symptoms were mitigated, too many </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">damaged hearts resulted</span><span class="font6"> and it was discontinued.

<p><span class="font6">The “Sauva” Ants</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">A Plague of Brazil</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">P</span><span class="font6">ERHAPS it would be interesting to the readers of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> to hear something of one of the greatest enemies of the Brazilian farmers, which is the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“sauna”,</span><span class="font6"> or cuttingant. Sauva, pronounced sah-6o-vah, of course is the common name by which they are known in the states of Rio de Janeiro and S. Paulo; but in the state of Minas Geraes they are called </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a formiga cortadeira,</span><span class="font6"> that is, “the cutting ant.” They abound in the open farming and grazing lands, in the old abandoned fields overgrown with brush, but very seldom are they found in the virgin forests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Just as there are three classes and sizes found in a hive of bees, so there are three different sizes and classes found among the colonies of the sauva ants, and I may say four, as follows: First, there is the laboring class, averaginghalf an inch in length, with a head somewhat larger than the body, and these are neutral gender; then the queen, about an inch in length, with a head very small compared with her body, and an abdomen about the size of a large green sweet pea; then the drones or males, which are a little smaller than the queen, both of which have wings; and finally there is still another class, which are larger than the common laborers, with a very large head which looks as if it were polished. These shiny-headed ones are very seldom seen outside of the nest, where they remain most of the time, and it is supposed that their work is to cut into a pulp the leaves and tender twigs brought in by the laborers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These ants are of a ruddy red color, although in some sections they are dark red, almost black. Their heads are triangular, ending at the lower point in two powerful serrated mandibles, with which they cause such terrible devastation to the truck gardens, fruit trees and floAvers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nothing pleases them better than to find a nice rosebush full of leaves and flowers; if they discover it in the evening, by next morning there ■will not be a single leaf left on the bush. Some of them climb up onto the branches and cut off the leaves in pieces in the shape of discs, from a quarter to half an inch in diameter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While these are engaged cutting off the leaves, others, busily taking up the pieces by holding one corner between their mandibles and balancing it over the head, march away with their loot in fine style. It is wonderful how strong they are for their size: one of them can</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Vergilio Ferguson</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">lift a grain of corn (Indian), which is ten times his own weight. He takes a firm hold on the stem end of the grain and, after a long series of strenuous efforts, sometimes lasting five minutes, at last he succeeds in raising it by main strength over his head; then off he goes, proud, but trembling with the weight. Then if there is a stiff wind, many times his cargo is blown over and he is capsized'with it, as he has no intention of letting go his prize; so then he has to repeat his acrobatic efforts until he succeeds in reaching the underground tunnel, where the wind cannot annoy him any more, and which leads to his headquarters. These headquarters or nests are easily distinguished from a distance by the mound of fresh-looking earth brought to the surface in small pellets by the ants in opening their underground tunnels and excavations, where their food is prepared and the rearing of their brood takes place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These mounds vary in size according to the number of years the colony has been established, averaging from two to three feet in diameter at the base a year or two after starting, up to twenty or thirty feet across after fifteen or twenty years. They are dome-shaped, the highest point measuring from two to four feet above the level of the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The living and breeding quarters are composed of a series of pear-shaped excavations one above the other, averaging from five to eight inches in diameter and separated by partitions of earth of various thicknesses. As the laborers deposit their cargoes of leaves or twigs into these excavations and return for another, the big polished-headed ones are supposed to cut them into a fine mass like pulp, which with the underground heat, and perhaps aided by the saliva of the masticators, a fermentation is developed. This pulp is very soft and is built up in the excavations somewhat similar in appearance to a coarse quality of sponge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Until a few years ago the general opinion was that the ants brought in the leaves for their food, but it was noticed that often there is found at the opening of their tunnels the dried pulp cast out, proving that it had not been eaten. At last it Avas discovered that as the pulp made from the green leaves begins to ferment a fungous growth or mushroom is produced and this is what they feed themselves with. So as soon as the sap is exhausted and no more fungus is produced it is cast out to make room for a fresh supply. It ” as also a problem to discover how and from what source comes the first supply of spores to start the growth of this kind of fungi when a new colony or nest is established by a single queen ant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Only a few years ago the state government of S. Paulo contracted with one of the most eminent American entomologists to investigate and make a complete report of the life and habits of the sauva ants</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">; so</span><span class="font6"> it was left to him to discover the secret, that is, that the queen ant, before leaving the home nest, takes a supply of spores of this fungus in the roof of her mouth, enough for a start in the future colony. This is how a new ant hill is established.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After a colony has been working for about two years it begins to send out in the spring of the year a number of queens; so, of course, the longer it remains, the greater will be the number of queens sent out each spring. A day or so after the first thunderstorm and heavy rain, about the end of October, it is interesting to watch the excitement around one of these ant nests. It is a great time with them; it is the day that the young queens take their leave to start new colonies. The mound where the nest lies will be covered all over with ants, large, small, young and old; all seem to be in a terrible state of excitement. At short intervals there appears at the entrance of the holes that lead down into their nest a young queen with large gauzy wings; alternately there emerges also amid the tumult a smaller ant, similar in appearance, having wings also, which is the male, corresponding with the drones found in the beehives. After a few minutes’ exercise with their wings they fly away in all directions on their nuptial flight and are mated in the air the same as the queen bees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During a day or two thousands of them can be seen flying in different directions away from the old nest, while the hawks and other insectivorous birds hover around having a good feast as they swallow the abdominal part and drop the remainder of the body with the head and wings, only of the queens. The native children and negroes also gather them after they alight on the ground, pull off the abdomen and eat them raw or fried, saying it is very tasty. Amid all these enemies I suppose not more than one in a thousand escapes destruction before a new home is established.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Directly after this eventful trip the male ant listlessly drifts to the ground, where he dies of starvation in a few days. Now we will follow the queen to see what becomes of her. During the flight she may have traveled several miles from the home nest, and as soon as the mating has taken place she alights on the ground, preferably in an open space or old roads. Then the first thing is to get rid of her wings (which she does by taking hold of one at </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> time with her mandibles and breaking them off next to the body), as she will need them no more and they would be only an encumbrance in the work she is to undertake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After running around hurriedly for a few minutes she soon selects a convenient spot on which she starts to work. There she immediately begins to dig a hole by cutting small pellets of the earth with her strong mandibles. These pellets are laid in a semicircle around the mouth of the hole, which is just large enough for her to go down in head foremost; and not having room to turn in, she returns to the surface tail foremost with the next load. In this way, as the earth is soft after the rain, in about an hour the hole is burrowed about seven or eight inches in depth, at the bottom of which there is a pocket excavated to the size of a goose egg. When this excavation is finished she takes up enough earth with which she firmly closes the opening to prevent other insects from intruding and to prevent the rain waters from running in. Here is where she starts laying eggs and rearing her young brood, and this becomes the nucleus around which the future colony multiplies and develops and becomes a threatening nuisance to all the crops, fruit trees and gardens near by.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From this nest they build tunnels leading out in all directions, about three-fourths of an inch in height by one and a half inches wide, which are some five or six inches below the surface of the ground. From these tunnels at different points an opening is made to the surface, from which a clean highway is built by clearing away all the debris, twigs, roots and grass about two inches wide, leading up to the trees or garden they have selected for their depredations. During the busy hours these roads are filled with ants of different sizes, some marching in haste with their cargo to headquarters and others returning for more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They have been known to travel half a mile or more from their nest to reach a cotton field, which is their delight, and if they are left alone they will finally destroy a great part of the crop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are several different devices and machines put on the market with which these ants are killed. There are also a number of volatile ingredients prepared with a sulphurous basis of an inflammable nature, which (after removing the loose earth from the surface) is poured into several of the openings leading to the main center of the nest; and in a few moments the fume expands, filling the cavities. This is then set on fire by striking a match at one of the openings. A great explosion takes place, which continues underground for some time afterwards, filling most of the cavities and canals with the poisonous sulphurous fumes, which kills them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the most practical and efficient machines now in use for fighting this pest consists of a portable cast-iron furnace, which is set over one of the main entrances of the nest. In this furnace a strong fire is made with charcoal, into which is thrown a few spoonfuls of a mixture composed of arsenic and sulphur. A tube is then connected to a powerful ventilator which drives these poisonous fumes into all the cavities, which generally gives good results when properly done. But if there is any cavity with eggs or young ants left that is not reached, they soon begin to multiply and start destruction again. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To rid the country of this plague is a very serious problem, and one of the principal drawbacks lies in the fact that there is such a vast amount of outlying lands which are neither under cultivation nor in pasture, where these ants are found in great numbers. So even when ■with a great amount of work and expense the small farmers and truck growers, who suffer most, succeed in destroying the ants on the area around their own homes, they are always obliged to keep up a continual vigilance and warfare against new invasions, not only from the nests farther away, but also from new nests being started every year by the queens sent out from those outlying breeding-grounds, where no one is willing or able to exterminate them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Still the farmers have one willing and valuable friend who helps in the fight against the sauvas, in the shape of the Tatu, pronounced tah-too; that is the armadillo, of which there are several species in Brazil. Although he is the cause of some damage among the crops of sweet potatoes and ground peas, he should be forgiven for this misdemeanor in exchange for the good he does in helping to destroy these ants. The next night after the queens have swarmed and settled down to business in their new homes, Mr. Tatu comes smelling along, and his nose guides him unfailingly to the spot where to find the queen; then he sets to work with his powerful claws and in a few moments he reaches the royal chamber, and without even a “with your leave”, he daintily swallows the inmate, then hurries off a few yards to repeat the operation on the next one. So in this way, in one night he may prevent hundreds of new colonies from developing into new centers of damage and destruction to the farmers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The depredations by the sauvas are so great in some localities that a celebrated French naturalist, whose name I forget, when traveling-through Brazil making his observations, said that unless the Brazilians destroy the sauvas, the sauvas will finally destroy the Brazilians. But we rejoice to know that in the coming kingdom and restitution of all things “they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain”. “And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpillar, and the palmerworm, [and the sauvas,] my great army which I sent among you.”'—Joel 2: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wonderful Organisation of Locusts</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">IpHAT the locusts which have recently been ravaging the whole of northern Africa and far into Asia and Europe have a most wonderful organization is believed by all who have studied their movements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At a signal from their leader, billions of them ■will suddenly drop upon a given area and every green thing is destroyed instanter. At other times they will fly for hundreds of miles -without alighting. When they leave an area every one of them leaves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The female locust lays four hundred eggs at a time, thereby putting the great American hen to shame. Locust eggs are laid in the ground, being pushed into the earth with the locust’s tail. A favorite method of killing them is to plow the ground and turn up the eggs to the rays of the tropic sun.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Feeding the Prisoners (Isaiah 49: 1) of the Scottish Islands</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">rpHE </span><span class="font6">child of God knows from the above and </span><span class="font7">4- </span><span class="font6">numerous other scriptures that there exists in the world today a great multitude of people (particularly in the denominational systems) who love God, but who through fear of the “ecclesiastical bullies” fail to carry out their vows to God. They sigh and cry for relief. God’s people are commissioned to go to these prisoners with the kingdom message and to feed them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are still some, however, who look upon this great multitude as something mythical. The reason is that to know of their existence we have to go to the people, door to door; and there we find them. The colporteur and the class workers meet them every day. Will you permit us to tell you of a trip we had through the Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland Isles, of Scotland, where we met many of the prisoners?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One September evening we sailed from Greenock (River Clyde) on the old cargo and cattle steamer “Dunora Castle”. It had been a dark, dismal, rainy day; and as we slid down the Clyde the dark clouds broke, and for a few minutes the glorious sun shone upon the waters of the Firth; and then it darkened again: a little picture of the great work of God on earth, in which we would have a part as we sent a shaft of light up the entire Hebrides by placing God’s message with the people in printed form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Barra was our first island for service. Castlebay is the seaport; an important fishing center. There was quite a crowd at the pier as we tied up; and very conspicuous were the B. C. priests watching those coming ashore. They might have been there to give us a “warm welcome”, but probably just down to break the monotony of church life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Barra is practically Catholic; and we had our first experience of sleeping in a Catholic home, with a “dozen saint images” arranged all around the room, giving us the good. If the “saints” had known what the cartons under the bed contained ! Our welcome in Barra was warm as far as the clergy were concerned; but in spite of them we placed many books with the people and were able to leave books at the Barra Head lighthouse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our next island was Eriskay. What a job we had to get “digs” here! We continually kept avoiding the schoolhouse until forced to try it. The Lord had a place there for us. The Catholic headmaster and mistress, learning the nature of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By James McPherson</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">our work, would not hear of our paying for accommodations. We left a full set of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Studies </span><span class="font6">with them. Eriskay has forty-eight inhabitants, Catholic with one exception. We left about fifty books..</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Crossing the ferry to South Hist Island, we found a people entirely under the thumb of the clergy, both Protestant and Roman Catholic. Nevertheless, a few took courage and listened to the message with eagerness. Two of these are noteworthy:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In one isolated district where everyone refused to even listen to the canvass, one young Catholic woman timidly asked the colporteur inside her home. Home ! An old broken-down thatched cottage, with a cow living in the same compartment with the people. In one corner lay her father, a paralytic wreck; and in another lay her mother, also a physical wreck. The daughter was doing her best to care for them, although weak and sickly herself. How sweet God’s message was.to her! With trembling she purchased </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance,</span><span class="font6"> and immediately hid it m an old chest, saying she knew she should not buy, but she needed its comfort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The other instance is that of a Catholic schoolmistress on the island. Her son in London had heard Judge Rutherford in the Royal Albert Hall giving the world powers a dusting, and had written commending it. She was ready to listen. By her questions she showed that she loved God and was groping to learn about Him. She purchased ten bound books and six booklets. She suffered much as a result of taking our books, but was glad to take a bold stand. She was secretary of the League of Nations for South Uist. At once she saw the subtlety of that league and admitted that it is of the Devil and decided to avoid it completely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the Island of Benbecula we found that our supply of books had not arrived, and so we had to continue to North Uist. This island is reached from Benbecula by means of a three-mile ford, when the tides are out. The folk of the Benbecula side lost no time in describing the difficulties of this ford, with its quicksands and its dangerous tides, and telling us that there was only one way, with a guide and a horse-trap and a “handsome charge”. However, they were dealing with “Scotch colporteurs”. We crossed that ford in about an hour and a half, with our boots and stockings around our neck, our trousers rolled up above our knees, and pushing our bikes loaded with cases, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We found things a little tough in North Uist. For about three weeks we had rain, more rain, and still more rain; and our books for the island were delayed, owing to the stormy weather. The Benbecula consignment had been misshipped by rail and by sea, and turned up a month later. The care and wisdom of our heavenly Father was ever manifest in all these experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the north part of North Uist was finished, we moved to Loch Eport, on the southwest of the island. We stayed at the home of the local policeman. Soon the lovers of fire and brimstone got busy; and the preacher gave an oration against the truth, “based” upon the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort for the People</span><span class="font6"> question about “scoffers”! He declared that those who sheltered us were aiding the Devil’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The policeman and his family, members of that church, were reading the books, and at once saw the position of their preacher. If our work had taken fifty years, we were welcome to stay at their home for that period. They did not again attend the church, and purchased every piece of the Society’s literature. The mother and the daughter in particular drank the truth from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> we received. They stated that they were happy to have servants of the Lord stay with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In these islands the bread the people make is called “scone”. The Gaelic sounds “sconyah”. It is baked in many different forms, sometimes in huge slabs. A great quantity of tea is consumed by these people. In many of the homes the fire is set in the middle of the floor, the smoke sometimes finding its way out through a hole in the roof, but more often filling the house. The roof is made of mud, straw and heather thatching. Our work in North Uist was difficult, but our joy was full.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Harris w’as our next island. This island is very mountainous, with villages scattered all along the coast. We placed a goodly number of books. We then pushed our bikes over the mountains to Lewis, staying at Balallan. From here we worked what is known as the Park or “Loch’s District”. Sometimes we had to walk eighteen miles to our territory, carrying about eighty bound books between us. But the prisoners were there, every time. The “Wee Frees” are strong in Lewis. In the colporteurs’ note book “Wee</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Frees” is defined as “hot stuff” or 100-percent hell fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We arrived at the time of Sacrament observance. This is the occasion that can be best used by the clergy to swing the “clubs”; and the heat at these meetings can be felt miles away. The services, many of them outdoors, were used to warn the people against the Society’s work, and particularly against </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We attacked Stornoway first, placing many books, and, giving the clergy little time, went around the entire island by foot, covering the coastline from Butt of Lewis to Bhreidhuis in two weeks, a distance of sixty-five miles, leaving over 600 books, mostly </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font6"> and Hell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the village of Shawbost we found the preacher going around warning the people; found him hiding in an old cowshed. The poor fellow was so excited and nervous when approached that he did not have a word to say. After a little encouragement and warning he took the first and the fifth volume of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Studies, </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hell,</span><span class="font6"> saying that he would read for himself first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lewis is called “the land of Scottish ministers”. The people are said to be “most loyal to same” (fear). Yet they long for deliverance. The shackles of deceit, superstition, and oppression are gradually falling, and God’s message is going out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our next move was to Skye, a beautiful island. The capital is Portree. The entrance to Portree from the sea is one of the most beautiful sights in these lovely islands. Certainly creation there reflects the glory of Jehovah. But the people are in darkness, deceived by the clergy ; and many of them are longing for deliverance. The clergy in Lewis had sent word to the “Skye pilots”, warning them against our books. So we were expected. As you know, this always spurs colporteurs on to greater activity. The island is mountainous and rainy, with great mists hanging over highlands, and houses all along the coast. We vmrked the island in a circle, moving on every day. Each stop seemed to be where someone w-as eager to hear of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We had many amusing experiences. Twice w<sup>T</sup>e had experiences where clergyman had instructed housekeeper or wife to say that he was not in; and you could smile, because out of the corner of your eye you could see him “beat it” behind a peat stack. Ah, 'well! A peat stack will not be of much good soon, when the people are after them! And so, in spite of them and their father, God left His message in the “misty island of Skye”. That finished this section of territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our next move was right across Scotland to the Shetland Isles. There we found a simple, kind and good-hearted people. Our joy was unspeakable, working there. Lerwick, the capital, is about eighty miles across from Bergen, Norway. We held a meeting in Lerwick. As a result, the “Plymouth Brethren” got very busy, circulating foolish and false tracts. They went from door to door, hoping to stop us. Up to that time our daily average was from forty to fifty books a day. As a result of their work and the Lord’s overruling, we averaged over one hundred a day for the rest of that week, in the streets of Lerwick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the great lights of this island defined the soul as an “unseen vision which at death hikes off and appears before God”! No wonder the people are steeped in ignorance! So starved have they been that, when we told them of God’s gracious provision for reconciliation and dispelled the ‘fires’ of hell, many of those poor folk wept for joy. Insanity, consumption and physical deformity were to be seen in every district.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One woman of about thirty-five years of age,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">was living alone in an old cottage. She stood about three feet from the ground, owing to deformity. The burden of sorrow this brought her, combined with the bunk served up by the preacher, caused her practically to despair. As we told her of God’s love for humanity and His great purpose of deliverance, the tears rolled down her cheeks. She loved God and wanted to know of Him. That dear woman had only one shilling (twenty-five cents). Two books cost sixty cents. She had quite a number of fresh eggs, however. You should have seen the joy in her face when told that she might have the books for a few fresh eggs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The same books, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hell,</span><span class="font6"> seemed to worry the high collars. Particularly did the little picture of the Hell screecher, with mouth extending from forehead to the top of his collar! We left about 3,GOO books in the Shetlands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our next group was the Orkney Isles. Our first month’s work was that of taking in the scattered islands: Westray, Sanday, Eday, Stron-say. The World War left a great impression here, owing to numerous naval operations in these islands. (Scapa flow, etc.) The people heard us with interest, and during the month of October relieved us of 1,560 books and booklets. The total for all the islands would be somewhere about 10,000 books and booklets.</span></p>

They infer that working-class action is always bloody in its incentive and, by implied comparison, that capitalism is peaceful and lifesecuring. This astounding state of mind has been spoken of as one of the world’s wonders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bussian revolution was a tea party, compared to capitalism’s bloody struggle of 19.1.41918. The number of lives lost in the revolution was infinitesimal in comparison with, the millions slaughtered in order to maintain the domination of the profit-making system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the British Empire alone it would, be interesting to learn the number of natives sacrificed during these past ten years to the end that British prestige be maintained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people accept the slaughter of capitalist wars and the violent suppression of native tribes as everyday events and as part of the God-ordained scheme of things. The death of millions of workers in the last European holocaust leaves the people cold; but they get quite hot about the collar when reference is made to the exterminating of a few hundred parasites in a proletarian revolution. This is the result of capitalist-controlled education. The supporters of capitalism are cunning, and they see to it that the working class are well filled to the brim with capitalistic ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The workers’ minds are warped and twisted, so that they will accept the exterminating that is done under capitalist rules and conditions. Then, through the capitalist-controlled press, the people are taught to regard the Bolsheviks with horror, as creatures without feeling, whose only thought is destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Is Hell Hot?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An address by Judge Rutherford, broadcast August 3 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">WATCHTOWER national chain program</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">TEIIOVAH GOD is the Author of the truth and the Creator of everything that is good. His good name is of far greater importance than any interest of any creature. To charge a man with a crime or wrongdoing tends to blacken his name and make bad his reputation among his fellows. If the charge is false and unsupported by the truth a great injustice is done to the one falsely charged. To charge Jehovah God with wrongdoing or crime blackens His good name in the minds of His creatures and tends to turn men away from the Most High One. If the charge is false it not only is a defamation of God’s name but works a greater injustice to His creatures. The evidence submitted in support of the charge, even though false, tends to turn men aw-ay from God and. they refuse to give ear to His commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On this occasion the purpose is to prove that for many centuries Jehovah God has been charged with, a great crime; that the evidence submitted in support of the charge is wholly false; that the wrongful charge and false testimony has turned millions of honest men away from God and led them into darkness and despair; that the truth will remove the veil of falsehood that blinds the people thereto and will turn them to God and bring to them peace of mind. For this reason the truth is of the greatest public necessity, convenience and importance. The charge here under consideration was and is made by the clergy of the various religious denominations of the world. The charge is inspired by God’s great enemy, Satan the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The false charge is that hell is a place and means of punishment by torture of the ungodly; that Jehovah God prepared such place before the creation of man, made it of sufficient size to contain all the wicked, and supplied it with an inexhaustible amount of combustible material to burn forever; that the wicked men at death are consigned to that place of torture; that the fires thereof, mingled with sulphur and brimstone, burn without ceasing; that the creatures cast into that great caldron of fire remain conscious and that their torment is eternal in duration, and that there is no hope of their release. Hell is represented as being the hottest place that could possibly exist. So thoroughly has this teaching been implanted in the mind of man that it is commonly understood that hell is a place of the most intense heat. The smelting furnace brought to white heat with burning gas and filled with red-hot molten iron is frequently used as an illustration, and it is commonly said by those who look upon it: “It is as hot as hell.” A volcano belches forth fire and rivers of red-hot molten rock, and the heat thereof, not being subject to adequate description, is by -way of comparison said to be “as hot as the burning-hell”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why these expressions uttered by all classes of men? The answer is, because the clergy over a long period of time have instilled into the minds of the people that hell is a place of indescribable heat and endless torment. They have taught the people that God made that burning hell in which to torment intelligent creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If the charge or teaching is true, then God is the worst fiend that could possibly exist and no intelligent creature could honestly obey and serve Him. If the executioner of the most depraved criminal would torture that criminal for one day with a red-hot iron he would thereafter be shunned and despised by every honest man of the land. It is not at all surprising that millions have been turned aw<sup>T</sup>ay from God because they were led to believe this terrible charge laid against Him. This false teaching has caused many to hear the name of God with fear and dread. Concerning this the Prophet Isaiah (29:13) wrote at God’s dictation: “Their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men.” The clergy are the ones that teach it. If the charge is false, then it is the most cruel and w-icked defamation of God’s holy name. The charge is false; and, it being false, every fair and honest person should be anxious to enlighten his fellow man concerning the truth, that, the living might have peace of mind concerning themselves and concerning their beloved dead and, above all, that the name of God be given its proper place before intelligent creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The clergy claim that the Bible supports their charge and teaching concerning eternal torment in hell. Every scripture brought forth by them -which they claim supports the eternal torment theory is used out of its proper setting and applied literally, when it is clear from the context that it is to be symbolically understood. An instance is that of the rich man in hell and the beggar in Abraham’s bosom, as described in the sixteenth chapter of Luke. Men are not consigned to endless torment because they are rich, nor do men go to heaven because they are poor. So far as the scripture under consideration sets forth and is concerned, the rich man had nothing against him except his riches, and the poor man had nothing to commend him to heaven except his poverty. The clergy expect intelligent people to believe their construction of this scripture. At once it is apparent that this scripture was used by Jesus to teach the Jewish people a lesson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Jews were God’s people and the only ones ever favored by being taken into a covenant, and are thus referred to in the Scriptures as being rich. Because that nation violated its covenant it was cast away from God, and has been in distress since. The Gentile nations were without God’s favor, and were spoken of as paupers for that reason. “Abraham’s bosom” Avas symbolically used to represent God’s favor. Jesus was telling in parabolic phrase what was coming upon the Jewish nation. A few years after His crucifixion the Jews were cast away and the Gentiles, represented by the pauper, came into God’s favor. Thus we see that the Jewish nation, represented by 'the rich man’, ceased to exist and, as a nation, went to hell, and God began to select His holy nation from the Gentiles, thereby showing His favor to the pauper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another text cited in support of the wrongful charge is that of Mark 9:47, 48, which reads: “And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out; it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than, having two eyes, to be cast into hell fire; where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.” Men are not taken into the kingdom of God because they gouge out their eyes; but the clergy would make you think they are. It is at once apparent that the language employed by Jesus in this text was used symbolically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The text shows that Jesus was teaching His disciples concerning the kingdom of God and the importance of their forsaking everything that might hinder them from entering that kingdom even though it be as dear as an eye. The w’ord “hell” used in this scripture is from the Greek word used to describe the valley of Hin-nom. To be sure, Jesus and His disciples knew what that valley represented. It was the place Avhere a fire was kept burning at all times for the destruction of the garbage of the city. That garbage being thrown over the precipice, some of it lodged on the Avails and ivas consumed by worms, and that Avhich reached the fire was destroyed by it. Hence the valley of Hinnom symbolically represented complete destruction. The lesson that Jesus taught, therefore, was: Ton having taken your stand for the kingdom, you must live by and through your faithfulness thereto or else suffer complete destruction. Hence it is better for you to give up everything that would hinder, even though as dear to you as an eye, that you might not be cast into destruction, represented by Gehenna.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The false charge of eternal torture finds its basis in the lie of Satan, to wit, inherent immortality of man. God said to man: ‘If you sin you shall surely die.’ Satan said to man: ‘You shall surely not die.’ Jesus declared that Satan is a liar and the father of lies. It must be admitted by all that no creature could be eternally tormented unless that creature were alive and conscious. It Avas necessary, therefore, for Satan to inject into the mind of man the lie of inherent immortality in order to find the basis for the lie of eternal torture. An immortal creature is one that cannot die. If man dies, then he could not be eternally tormented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God alone Avas and is immortal originally. In 1 Timothy 6:16 it is stated that “[God] only hath immortality”. Jesus was the beginning of God’s creation, but He wms not immortal from the beginning. In John 5: 26 He says: “As the Father hath life [inherent], so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself.” In Romans 2: 6, 7 the language is addressed to the followers of Christ Jesus, Avho are admonished to seek immortality. A man does not seek that w<sup>T</sup>hich he already possesses. In 1 Corinthians 15: 53 it is written concerning those who are the folloAvers of Christ : “This mortal must put on immortality.” All the Scriptures show that man is not immortal; and, that being true, eternal torment of man is an impossible thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But in their attempt to meet this indisputable conclusion the clergy say that every man has a soul and that that soul of man is immortal and that when man dies his soul continues to live. That statement is completely contradicted by the scripture of Ezekiel 18:4: “The soul that sinneth, it shall die.” Other scriptures support this conclusion. Every man </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font6"> a soul, but no</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Satan caused the nations other than the Jews to believe in torment by lire and to worship the Devil. The Jews fell awmy from their covenant, and under the influence of the Devil they built an image called “Molech” and caused their children to walk through the fire before this image and sacrificed their children thereto. This they did against God’s commandments. Satan thereby instilled into the mind of the Jews the wicked doctrine of torment; and concerning this it is written in Jeremiah 32: 35: &quot;And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.” This proves that the torment doctrine is an abomination in the sight of God and is therefore the Devil’s doctrine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Answer</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bible, which is God’s Word, speaks the truth and gives the correct answer concerning hell. The announced penalty foi’ the wilful violation of God’s law is death. Those who die go to hell, because “hell” means the condition of death. Hell is the grave or tomb to which the dead are consigned, which is cold and lifeless and where there is no knowledge, wisdom, love or hate. It is written in Ecclesiastes 9:5,10: “The living know that they shall die, but the dead know not any thing, . . . there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in [hell].” “The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go down into silence.” (Ps. 115:17) If the dead have no knowledge, wisdom or consciousness in hell or the grave it would be impossible to torment them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Old Testament was written in the Hebrew language, and the Hebrew word </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">sheol</span><span class="font6"> is the one translated “'hell”. It is also translated “pit” and “'grave”, and means the same thing in each instance. The Greek word </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">hades</span><span class="font6"> means the same thing; hence the words </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">sheol, hades </span><span class="font6">and “hell” all mean the same condition or place. In the earlier English literature the word “hell” meant a dark place or condition. The farmer would properly say: T have put my winter apples in hell’; meaning thereby that he had buried his winter apples in a dark place to preserve them for food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Job was being tormented by his false professed friends he uttered the words in Job 14:13: “0 that thou wouldest hide me in hell </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[sheol], . . </span><span class="font6">. until thy wrath be past.” If hell had meant a place of torment Job would not have prayed God to send him there. He was surely getting enough torment from those pious frauds. Job understood hell to be a condition of silence. His prayer was that he might be released from suffering until God’s due time to give him an opportunity for life in the resurrection. That hell is not a place of fire and great heat is further proven by Job’s words: “If I wait, hell is mine house: 1 have made my bed in the darkness.” (Job 17:13) The fact that this scripture says that hell is a condition of darkness is proof that it is not a place of fire and brimstone and heat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The charge which the clergy have laid against God is that He created the hell or torment wherein He could torture the wicked. It will be conceded by all that Jesus Christ was at all times pure and righteous and the dearly beloved Son of Jehovah God. If the indisputable proof shows that Jesus went to hell at the time of His crucifixion, that would show that the charge that God made hell a place of torment is utterly false.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">David, one of God’s prophets, was a type of Jesus Christ and wrote words that applied to Jesus Christ. Before Jesus came to earth that prophet wrote, in Psalm 16:10: “Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.” The Apostle Peter, at Pentecost, quoted these words of the prophet and specifically applied them to Jesus Christ and stated that the soul of Jesus at death went to hell, was there three days, and at the end of that time God raised Him up out of hell. (Acts 2: 30-32; 10: 40) Had hell been a place of eternal torment, Jesus could not have been brought out. In order to provide the ransom price for man, Jesus must die as a sinner by taking the sinner’s place, and therefore He must go to hell. And this he did. This proves that the penalty inflicted upon the sinner is death in the grave, and not life in a condition of torture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jacob, who was in fact the beginning of the Jewish nation, had twelve sons. His favorite and beloved son Joseph was wrongfully sold by his brethren into Egypt. They represented to their father that Joseph had been killed by wild beasts. The information brought great sorrow upon Jacob, and concerning which it is written that “his sons and all his daughters rose up to cornfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go do^vn info hell </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[sheol, </span><span class="font6">the grave] unto my son mourning”. (Gen. 37:35) We may be sure that God would not send His good servant Jacob and Jacob’s faithful son Joseph into a place of eternal torment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Joseph became a great ruler in Egypt. Unaware of this his brethren went there to purchase food. Recognizing them Joseph commanded that they should return to Palestine and bring down their younger brother Benjamin. When these sons requested their father Jacob to send Benjamin he replied, in Genesis 42:38: “My son [Benjamin] shall not go down with you; for his brother [Joseph] is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall [Benjamin] by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow’ to the grave </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[sheol,</span><span class="font6"> hell].” Jacob could not have meant that his gray hairs would go into a place red hot and burning with fire and brimstone. Hairs would not endure long in such a place. Confronted with this dilemma the translators refused to render the word </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">sheol</span><span class="font6"> as “hell” in this text, but rendered it “grave”, and that is its proper meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In every instance in the New<sup>7</sup> Testament Vvhere the Greek word </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">hades</span><span class="font6"> is used its meaning is the same as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">sheol</span><span class="font6"> in the Old Testament. The Greek v<sup>7</sup>ord </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">gehenna</span><span class="font6"> is also translated “hell”, and it means complete destruction. One man may kill another and thereby send his victim into hell or the grave, and in that instance the ■word </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">sheol</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">hades</span><span class="font6"> would be employed. God can destroy, not only the life of man, but his right to life, and thus make it impossible for the creature ever to live again. The one thus destroyed also goes to hell, but the word </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">gehenna</span><span class="font6"> is used because it stands for complete destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus gave a striking explanation of this distinction. He vzas instructing His disciples concerning the work that He would assign them to do. lie had told them that they -would suffer persecution at the hands of men because of their faithfulness in serving God but that they should not fear men. He told them that they should fear to disobey God. Then He said to them (Matt. 10:28): “Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.” In this text the word “hell” is from the Greek </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">gehenna,</span><span class="font6"> meaning destruction, and the text proves that no man can but God only can completely destroy a creature. The Pharisees willingly and knowingly persecuted Jesus. Jesus told them they were hypocrites, and then said to them: “Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers! how<sup>7</sup> can ye escape the damnation of hell?” (Matt. 23:33) In this instance the Vvord </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">gehenna,</span><span class="font6"> meaning destruction, is translated “hell”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All scriptures show that “hell” means the condition of death or destruction. Hell is therefore cold and silent. It is not hot, nor is there heard in it the shrieks of tormented creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Concerning Jehovah God it is written: “God is love.” The clergy admit that. “Love” means unselfishness in action. Everything God does is consistent. He could not be consistent and at the same time torment a creature. Consistency alone would compel Him to administer no greater punishment than death, because that is -what He announced as the penalty. Love would not admit of His doing anything for the purpose of gratifying a selfish desire to torment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In His Word God invites men to reason witli Him. That proves that everything with God is reasonable. Is it at all reasonable that God would tell men that death &quot;would follow his disobedience and then, after man had committed sin, consign him to eternal torture? What good could result from so doing? The eternal conscious suffering of a creature could bring no pleasure nor glory to the great Jehovah God. He takes pleasure only in those who joyfully obey Him, as it is 'written in Psalm 149:4. The fire-hell-torment theory is not supported by reason or by the Bible. The teaching thereof is a cruel defamation of God’s name. If the clergy believe the doctrine of eternal torment, then they should no longer tell the people that God is love. Furthermore, they should hasten to warn the people to escape eternal torment, and this they should do regardless of wdiether they receive one cent salary or not. If they do not believe the eternal torment charge, then they should be diligent in telling the people what is the truth; for two good and sufficient reasons: (1) Because the truth would give the people a proper understanding of God and remove from His name the defamation placed there by the false charge; and (2) the truth would bring peace of mind to the people and enable them to return to God. The fact that the clergy do not tell the people the truth and thus enable them to get a proper conception of God is of itself proof that they are neither wise nor consistent, and are not safe teachers of the people. Let the people determine whether or not it is to their interest to further give heed to these false teachers. My advice to you would be that you inform yourselves concerning God’s Word and follow its teachings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The clergy of this day know that the teaching of eternal torture in hell is a false teaching. Yet they make no attempt to place the truth before the minds of the people. Instead, they let this defamation against God’s name stand, so far as they are concerned. Claiming to teach His Word they employ their time in teaching the people matters of politics and so-called “philosophy”. What the people really need is to understand the truth, and the clergy should either teach the people that or else refrain from claiming to teach the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The truth is, God sentenced man to death because of a violation of His law, and that death process was gradual until it terminated in hell, ■which is the grave. By inheritance death passed upon all the human race. God’s purpose was and is to redeem man from hell and the grave and to give him an opportunity to intelligently obey Him and live. Therefore He made this promise: “I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: 0 death, I will be thy plagues; 0 grave, I will be thy destruction.” (Hos. 13:14) Jesus died and went to hell and was raised out of hell in order that He might be the Redeemer and Savior of mankind. Now the kingdom is being established, and through the kingdom all in tneir graves, which is hell, will be brought out and given a knowledge of the truth and a full and complete opportunity to obey the Lord and live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hence it is written, in John 3:16: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that wdiosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” Had God intended the people to understand that the penalty for -wilful sin is eternal torment and that the wncked sinner must suffer torture eternally He would have so stated. On the contrary, He said that His love for poor humankind is such that He gave His only beloved Son into death in order that those who believe might not perish. To “perish” means to go completely out of existence. To be eternally tormented a man must continue in conscious existence forever. The Lord says that the human race -would perish unless He rvould exercise His love for man. The clergy say that those who die outside of the church, and therefore as sinners, will not perish but will remain forever alive and conscious and that their torment is perpetual. Which do you want to believe, God or the clergy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The plain statement of God’s Word is that because of inherent sin mankind wrns headed for destruction and that the only possible way to prevent him from perishing wrns for God to provide redemption through the willing sacrifice of a perfect man; that on earth there was no perfect man to meet these requirements; that God sent into the world His only begotten and dearly beloved Son, who was made a man, perfect, and of flesh and blood and dwelt upon the earth; that His Son willingly suffered death as man’s substitute and that God permitted this because of His love for mankind and that in due time all men shall learn these truths and have the opportunity to believe and to obey the truth and to receive life everlasting. These great truths -would be rendered absolutely null and void if the eternal torment charge were true. Every man should rejoice that it is untrue, and no honest man should want it to be true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In desperation the advocates of eternal torment say: Tf there is a heaven there must be a hell and it must be a place of torture for the wicked.’ But you never heard of one of these advocates to want such a place of eternal torment for himself or for his loved ones, or even for his dog. Those who strongly advocate eternal torment pose as more holy and righteous than others, and of course they would not expect to go to such a place. It is only the perverted mind, made so by the influence of the wicked one Satan, that could desire and advocate willingly a place of torture for any creature. But the statement that heaven implies that there is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> place of torment is another false conception of God’s Word. The clergy state that all the good go to heaven immediately upon death; and in this they are wrong. Not all who are called “good”, as that term is used, go to heaven w-hen they die, by any means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Next Sunday morning, by the Lord’s grace, consideration will be given to what and where is heaven and who go there and what are the conditions whereby one may enter heaven.</span></p>

It is, of course, necessary for us to place at the disposal of the public, blank forms on which messages intended for telegraphic transmission can be written, but this is the only purpose for which they are supplied. The example which you enclose and which I am returning herewith as you request, represents a flagrant misuse of our stationery. I am asking our officials in charge of the Charlotte office to try to trace it to its source and to do what they can to prevent a recurrence.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The other day, out in the work of witnessing for the Kingdom, we were told of a Baptist preacher at Tyler Hill, Pa., who was caught in the act of regularly stealing the cream off a neighbor’s can of milk. A few days later we were told of another minister who had bought a horse on credit and tried to sneak out of the county at night without paying for it, and only a few days later another mam volunteered that he had been an usher in the church until he found his pastor in his cellar, about to sneak out the back way with ten quarts of cider that he had helped himself to, without asking for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This leads us to ask, What is there about this preaching business that leads to stealing telegraph blanks, cream, cider and horses? What would lead a crook not only to steal telegraph blanks but to forge another’s name to them. The answer is easy. A man cannot be an honest man today and give the sanction of his name to the eternal torture theory. The light is shining too brightly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But preaching a certain kind of so-called “Gospel” is an easy way of bluffing a living out of a community, and take it with a little stealing of stationery, and forgery, and swiping of cider and cream and horses and other things that most people have to work for, one can get along, for the present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But the day is surely coming when alarm clocks at 89c each, and overalls at $1.25 a suit, and callouses on the hands, at any price, will look good to these saints in black, and there will be a grand rush for the hayfield in summer and the woodlot in the winter “with none to molest or make them afraid”,.</span></p>
