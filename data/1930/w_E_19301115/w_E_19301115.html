<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font5">HIS journal is published for the purpose of aiding the people to understand Jehovah’s purposes. It provides systematic Bible study in which all its readers may regularly engage. It gives announcement of the visits made to Bible classes by traveling speakers, announces conventions, and gives reports thereof. It announces radio programs and publishes suitable Bible instruction for broadcasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It adheres strictly to the Bible as God’s revealed Word of Truth. It stands firmly upon the great ransom sacrifice as tho fundamental doctrine by which all doctrines are measured. It is free from parties, sects and creeds of men. It does not assume a dogmatic attitude, but confidently invites a careful examination of its utterances in the light of the infallible Word of God. It does not indulge in controversies, and its columns are not open to personalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, the Maker of heaven and earth, and is from everlasting to everlasting; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation; that the Logos became a man; that he is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and in earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THAT GOD </span><span class="font5">created the earth for man, and created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrongful act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THAT </span><span class="font5">JESUS was made a human being in order that </span><span class="font6">he </span><span class="font5">might become the Redeemer of man; that he gave his life a sacrifice for man and thereby produced the ransom price; that Jesus the divine was raised from the dead, ascended into heaven, and presented the value of his human sacrifice as the redemptive price for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THAT FOE MANY CENTURIES God, through Christ, has been selecting from amongst men the members of his church, which constitutes the body of Christ; that the mission of tho church is to follow in the footsteps of her Lord Christ Jesus, grow in his likeness, give testimony to the name and purpose of Jehovah God, and ultimately be glorified with Christ Jesus in his heavenly kingdom; that Christ, Head and body, constitutes the “seed of Abraham’’ through which all families of the earth shall be blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THAT THE WORLD HAS ENDED; that the Lord Jesus has returned and is now present; that Jehovah has placed Christ Jesus upon his throne and now commands all nations and peoples to hear and obey him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THAT </span><span class="font5">THE GREAT ISSUE before all creation now is the vindication of Jehovah’s word and name, and that it is the privilege and duty of every true Christian to give the testimony of Jesus Christ, and to make known that the kingdom of heaven is come. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">This gospel of the kingdom must he preached.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">YEAR BOOK</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font5"> for 1931 will be ready for delivery about December 15. It contains the President’s Annual Report, which is very encouraging to all the anointed. For instance, the report shows an increase of 150 percent in the distribution of bound books in Germany during the year. There was a large increase in the United States and in other places. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> list is especially interesting. A number of subscribers canceled their subscriptions during the year, presumably because no longer in harmony with the Society. About the same number of new subscribers were enrolled, and the number of workers in the field has increased. This indicates that the Lord has someone ready to take the place of anyone who steps aside. There are many other interesting features in the report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A number of classes report that where the class is small a portion of the Prayer Meeting hour is used in giving consideration to some part of the Report relating to a country. In this way the workers keep in close touch with every part of the field, and this is an encouragement to each other. The suggestion is a good one, and profitable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the complete report are the Scripture texts with comments for the year. First is the Year Text, with appropriate comment, and a text for each Wednesday prayer meeting; and then a text for every day of the year, with suitable comment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Send your orders in promptly. If each ecclesia, through its secretary or stockkeeper, will act promptly in sending in orders, designating the number you wish, this will greatly aid us in determining the number to bind up. The limited edition makes it necessary to take the usual price of fifty cents a book. Where the class orders a number through the stockkeeper, the shipment may be by parcel post, freight or express.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark3"></a>OPPOSING GOD</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Hear the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name’s sake, said, Let the Lord be glorified: but he shall</span><span class="font6"> appear </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.’’—Isa. 66: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">J</span><span class="font6">EHOVAH builds his own house. No creatures can build it for him. “Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it; except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.” (Ps. 127:1) Some who have heard the call to the kingdom have failed to learn this great and plainly expressed truth. Creatures may do some work on the Lord’s house, but they must do it in God’s appointed way, otherwise it will be rejected. Jehovah by his Chief Executive Officer assembles the material and erects the structure.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> The house or temple of God is made up of his chosen and anointed ones. No man can put another into that temple of God, and no man can take one out of it. The Scriptures plainly teach that an attempt will be made to build a house and call it the house of God, but which in fact is opposed to God’s house. Being warned that Satan at this time would use every endeavor to destroy God’s remnant on the earth it is to be expected that he would attempt a counterfeit of God’s house and that some would be drawn into such a movement and become opposers of Jehovah because they have not received the love of the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> The context and setting of this prophecy aids to the understanding of the text directly under consideration. The second part of the book of Isaiah deals with the deliverance of the captives of Israel who were held by Cyrus, the conqueror, in Babylon. The historical facts are that with the deliverance of Israel came also the instruction from Cyrus to rebuild the temple of Jehovah at Jerusalem. Cyrus issued a proclamation and spread it throughout all his kingdom, which at that time was considered as being “all the kingdoms of the earth’’. That proclamation declared that God had charged Cyrus to build him a house in Jerusalem that the worship of Jehovah might once again be had there.—2 Chron. 36: 22, 23; Ezra 1:1-4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> Since these things were written to have particular application and meaning at the end of the world, it might be expected that in Isaiah’s prophecy there would be some reference made to the rebuilding of the temple of Jehovah and the coming of Christ thereto and that the information would be given especially for the encouragement and comfort of the anointed ones.—Rom. 15:4; 1 Cor. 10:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> In the prophecy of Isaiah Cyrus is used to picture or represent the Servant of Jehovah who is used to build up Zion. The name Cyrus means “sun”, and he was used by the Lord to picture the “Sun of righteousness”. (Mal. 4:2) The first captives that were delivered from Babylon and returned to Jerusalem helped to prepare the ground or way for those that followed later. Following the deliverance came the rebuilding of the temple. God caused Isaiah to prophesy and express his will in this matter: “[The Lord] saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.”—Isa. 44: 28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> While it is true that Cyrus had not known God, yet he was used by Jehovah in a representative capacity. That which was of paramount importance in rebuilding the temple was to show to the people that Jehovah is the only God, besides whom there is none, and this would result beneficially to his creatures. Only a small number of the Jews, comparatively speaking, returned with Zerubbabel and Joshua under the order of Cyrus. These began the rebuilding of the temple. It is to be expected that God would encourage those whom he had commissioned and sent to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple as long as they carried out his orders in the appointed way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>7</sup> Returning now to Isaiah’s prophecy (66:1-4): The words of the prophet are clearly not words of encouragement, but words of rebuke from Jehovah. This would seem to foreshadow that the class which in the name of the Lord would claim to be rendering the sacrifice and service unto God, by attempting to build a house or city, was doing so contrary to God’s appointed way. Jehovah through his prophet says: “The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the place of my rest?” (Isa. 66:1) This text and context indicate an attempt on the part of the company claiming to be followers of Christ to build an organization contrary to the will of God and in opposition to his Word. Hence the words of rebuke.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">339</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> The last chapter of Isaiah’s prophecy seems to be in the nature of an epilogue, and it presents a situation which has a correspondency at the time Christ gathers together his people unto himself at the temple. This prophecy or afterspeech seems to be immediately followed with a great event. It is now made clear to the anointed people of God that most of Isaiah’s prophecy is in course of fulfilment. The “servant” has been made manifest to the anointed on earth, to whom God has said: “Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the nations.”—Isa. 42: 1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> Christ Jesus has come to his.temple, and has budded up Zion, and those that are brought under the robe of righteousness and into the temple are made a part of the “servant”. The “servant” has God’s special favor. The work of the “servant”, and particularly those composing that part on the earth, has been made plainly to appear. The words of the Head apply to all who are members of the “servant”, to wit, “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because Jehovah hath anointed me.” God has put his spirit upon the “servant” and commissioned the “servant” to do his work, and all of the anointed who do that work must do it in God’s appointed way. Anyone that would attempt to take another or different course of action than that outlined by the Lord would be an abomination to him and therefore subjected to his rebuke.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup> The period of time designated as ‘ preparing the way before Jehovah’ began about 1878. That marks the time when the spiritual Israelites in Babylon began to be delivered under the guidance of the truths restored and made known to them. The light of truth concerning the second appearing of Christ Jesus then began to be understood, and from that time forward those who received the truth have divided themselves into three companies or groups, to wit: (1) those who once saw the truth and then forsook it; (2) those who received the truth and for a time rejoiced in the prospect of occupying a high position in heaven and of being joint rulers of the world, and who because of ■their wrong motive were led away into error by the subtle influence of the wicked one; and (3) that company which received the truth and the love of the truth, and which has been faithfully watching to know and to do the will of God, being diligent in his service, and doing that service in God’s appointed way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>11</sup> Those composing this latter class have known better than to attempt to build a house or temple for Jehovah. They have appreciated the truth that except Jehovah build the house it could not be built. Discerning the truth of and concerning the temple of God, and of their great privilege of being made a part thereof, by the grace of God, this faithful little company has delighted to speak continuously of Jehovah and his temple, and to show forth his. praises by being his witnesses as commanded. (Ps. 29:9) It is not at all reasonable that Jehovah would rebuke this little faithful company and cast them away from him and refuse their sacrifices as being abominable in his sight.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>12</sup> It is therefore evident that chapter sixty-six of Isaiah’s prophecy opens with a rebuke to those who have sought to go about and claim to do God’s work in their own way and contrary to God’s way. They have been negligent in ascertaining the will of God and have been doing what work they have done according to their own selfish desires. There are those, as is well known, who claim that they are the temple of God, that they are God’s little flock and elect, and who refuse to have any part in giving testimony according to God’s commandments, and who openly oppose those who do give that testimony. Such are properly designated the opposers of God. The plain statement of Jehovah is that no temple that these opposers shall build will be acceptable and that their sacrifices are obnoxious to him. Concerning such Jehovah by his prophet says: “When I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.” —Vs. 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>13</sup> To this same class Jehovah speaks in chapters fifty-eight and fifty-nine of Isaiah’s prophecy, giving fair warning and bidding them to become awake to their opportunities and to join with his organization and go forward with his work, and telling them that a failure to do so would completely separate them from God. These are told by the Lord that they keep the sabbath in their own selfish way. (Isa. 58:13) God has declared what he would have done in this day of his rest and that his people particularly should be his witnesses. (Isa. 43:10-12) Then adds the prophet of God: “Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it: that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.” (Isa. 56: 2) Through his Word God makes it plain as to who would please and who would displease him. Concerning this class that is first indifferent and then becomes opposers it is written by the prophet of the Lord: “Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labors. Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness; ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high.” (Isa. 58:3,4) Thus is plainly pointed out a class that ignore God’s will and take a course marked out by their own selfishness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>14</sup> It must be true that God has but one organization doing his work on earth. It would be wholly unreasonable and inconsistent for God to have two opposing organizations and both actually doing his work. God is not inconsistent in anything. That being true, then any company that would oppose God’s organization and forsake it would thereby be forsaking and opposing the Lord. This is evidently the class referred to by the prophet of God who says: “But ye are they that forsake the Lord, that forget my holy mountain [organization], that prepare a table [different from God’s table] for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number.”—Isa. 65:11,12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>15</sup> These words are almost identical with the words used in Isaiah 66: 4 and show that they have reference to the same class. The sacrifices of such class being contrary to God’s appointed way, he says concerning those who thus sacrifice and of their sacrifices: “He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacri-ficeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog’s neck; he that of-fereth an oblation, as if he offered swine’s blood; he that burneth incense, as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul de-lighteth in their abominations. ’ ’—Isa. 66: 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>16</sup> After Zerubbabel, and the released Israelites with him, returned to Jerusalem it was proper for them to work on the temple building, because that was God’s expressed purpose and will concerning them. They must do that work, however, in God’s appointed way, and they did. In these last days, when God is errecting his temple not made with hands, his people have been informed concerning the temple and its rebuilding and their own work or service in connection with its being brought together and their opportunity to do service. Those who serve, therefore, must render service to God in his appointed way. He has but one appointed way. It follows that anyone who would pursue a contrary course would be opposing God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>17</sup> The coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and gathering together unto him of his faithful followers dates from 1918. (2 Thess. 2:1) It is from that time in particular that disobedience to the Lord began to be manifested by those who professed to be in the covenant with him. The truth continued to be made clear from that time forward and objection and opposition thereto has been manifested by those who have broken away from the Society since said date, and this opposition has increased. In Revelation 11:18,19 it is disclosed that the day of God’s wrath is come and that the temple in heaven is open. Immediately following is the statement of Revelation 12 of two great signs in heaven, which are, to wit, God’s organization and Satan’s organization. The opposers of the Society have declined to accept these signs in the heavens by which God’s people are to be guided. They refuse to see the organization of Jehovah pictured by the woman giving birth to the man child. They decline to accept the truth of and concerning Satan’s organization. They reject completely the opposition of Satan, pictured by the dragon’s attempt to destroy the man child. They also refuse to accept the truth of God’s building up Zion from that time forward. Not only do they refuse to accept these truths, but they vigorously oppose them and denounce those whom God has permitted to call attention to them. Rejecting these present-day truths they refuse to have any part in giving testimony concerning the kingdom of God and that Jehovah is the only true God. They refuse to call attention to Satan’s organization that is opposing God. They oppose the organization which God has used for more than half a century to proclaim his truth and which he now continues to use.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> Instead of being obedient to the Lord they go about trying to form an organization according to their own pattern. They attempt to build a house and an organization different from God’s organization, and therefore God says to them: “Where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the place of my rest?” Jehovah tells them he is building his own house and that he looks with approval, not on the efforts of the opposers, but upon his own people who are poor in their own sight, and of a contrite spirit, and who are joyfully obedient to the Word of God. Thus the organization of Jehovah and those opposing his organization are here clearly made manifest. Those of God’s organization on earth love him and are devoted to him. Those who oppose God and his organization love themselves. Therefore God says concerning the opposers: ‘I will choose their delusions, and bring then* fears upon them. ’ Concerning this same class it is written in the Word of God: “And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. ’ ’—2 Thess. 2:11, 12.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ENCOURAGED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> Then Jehovah addresses those who make up the company that heeds and obeys his Word. He causes his prophet to say: “Hear the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word: Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name’s sake, said, Let the Lord be glorified; but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.” (Isa. 66: 5) Jehovah tells these faithful ones that the opposers, once their brethren who walked with them, have hated them and cast them out because of their faithfulness to God’s name, and that these opposers then claimed to do this to the glory of God. It is well known that every company that has withdrawn from the Society, and every person forming a part of any of these companies, has done so of his own volition. Ambitious and selfish leaders in little groups have led this company of opposers out. While this company of opposers disagree amongst themselves and find no unity in the Lord’s service, they all oppose the witness work of the Society that is being done in the name of and in obedience to the commandments of the Lord. The leaders in this opposition say: “Let us vigorously oppose and resist tho Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society and thereby let the name of the Lord be glorified.” Their attitude and speech tend to discourage some of God’s people, and for their encouragement Jehovah says to them, in substance: ‘Be not discouraged; for the Lord shall appear to your joy and they shall be ashamed.’ Thus again the two classes are clearly made known, one that serves God and the other that opposes God.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>20</sup> Those who tremble at God’s Word are the ones who are diligent to keep and obey his commandments. They have no fight, to be sure, with the opposers of God’s work. They are being attacked by the opposers, and mention is here made of it, not for the purpose of controversy, but that God’s people may be encouraged in seeing the fulfilment of prophecy, as it is manifested by the will of God they shall be encouraged. When it is clearly seen that the opposition to God’s work was long ago foretold by his prophet, and that the prophecy is now being fulfilled, such is a great encouragement to the faithful and is an evidence that the Lord is dealing with them and that they are in his favor. It is therefore clear that it is the will of God that attention of the faithful shall be called to these things at this time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>21</sup> The total number of those who have withdrawn from the Society and now oppose its work is comparatively large, when such are taken all together. These are now divided into many companies, all claiming to be followers of Christ and claiming to be God’s little flock, while at the same time they speak evil things concerning those who are faithfully endeavoring to serve God. They denounce the Society and its work, saying that its activities are due to a man-made theory and that those who go to make up the Society are carnally minded and are engaged in a book-selling business and not in the service of Jehovah. Their leaders in various companies say: ‘‘Let us get together and select men and send them amongst the various ecclesias that compose the Society and cause dissensions there and break up their work.” These opposers of God’s work refuse to see the vicious organization of Satan the enemy and to warn anyone against it. Even when they see the thief stealing the devotion of the people away from God they refuse to give warning.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>22</sup> They continually speak evil of those who are in the covenant with the Lord. While they are doing all this opposition work they claim to be God’s representatives. Clearly the Lord’s prophet speaks of this opposition class when he says: “But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth, seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my word behind thee? When thou sawest a thief, then thou con-sentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers. Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit. Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother’s son.” —Ps. 50: 16-20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>22</sup> It is presumptuous for any man or company of men to attempt to build the house or organization of Jehovah unless directed to do so. Moses erected the tabernacle in the wilderness, not according to his own ideas, but exactly according to the pattern which God showed to him. The Israelites could not make a place of worship to Jehovah contrary to his direction. David desired to build the temple for Jehovah and was not allowed to do so, although God gave him credit for his right condition of heart. When the time came that Jehovah would have a temple built he directed that Solomon should build the same, and it was so built. (1 Chron. 17:11,12; 28:1-12) The spirit of the Lord God provided David with the pattern of the porch of the house for the temple, and Solomon was directed to build it accordingly. When the exiles returned from Babylon they built the temple, not according to their own desires, but according to the instructions of the Lord. Cyrus was acting as a type of Christ and he gave the orders for the rebuilding of the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem. (See Ezra 1:3.) Contrary to this divine rule the opposers of God’s organization, named in Isaiah 66:1, presumptuously set about to build a temple and a city, which is a symbol of an organization, about which they have not received instructions from the Lord. They direct their own way and work contrary to God’s instructions and are therefore workers of iniquity.—Matt. 7: 23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>24</sup> No man or company of men has put these opposers out of God’s organization, nor could they put them out; but the opposers, by persisting in their wrongful course of action, have been gathered out by the Lord. (Matt. 13:41) Therefore Jehovah says to such: “Where is my place of rest?” These words of Jehovah surely refer to the city or organization which Jehovah acknowledges as his own. That organization is Zion, as it is written: “For the Lord hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation. This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.”(Ps. 132:13,14) This must mean that any other organization asid$ from Zion God would not recognize, and the fact that the Lord Jehovah uses the Society in his work and that the Society is doing his work shows that those who oppose are opposing the work of God. Zion is made up of God’s approved and anointed ones.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>25</sup> There is now a concerted movement amongst the leaders of the various groups which have withdrawn from and which oppose the work of the Society, to form a compact or an organized effort having for its objective the more effective opposition to the work of the Society. This the Lord foretold through his prophets for the encouragement of his own people. In keeping with his precious promise he says: “New things do I declare; before they spring forth I tell you of them. ’ ’ —Isaiah 42: 9.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ORGANIZATIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>26</sup> By the language of Isaiah 66: 6 is again disclosed two organizations, one which is in confusion and opposes God, and the other which is in harmony with and serves God. A voice is a symbol of a message or doctrine being proclaimed. The prophet first speaks of a voice of noise from a city or organization and which is therefore discordant. The other voice the prophet mentions yields sweet harmony. The prophet says: “A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the Lord that rendereth recompence to his enemies.” (Isa. 66: 6) The voice of one who cannot sing when attempting to sing produces a rasping, discordant noise. A company of such voices produces an exceedingly discordant noise. The companies opposing the Society have each some pet measure to sing. All these try to harmonize their notes in opposition to the message of God’s kingdom. The combined efforts of their organizations trying to act in one organization results in a voice of noise from the city, symbolic of an organization. There is no unity or beauty about it, but everything contrary thereto. There is no sound more beautiful and harmonious to the human ear than that of the trained human voice singing praise to Jehovah God. The voice of a spirit creature must be far more wonderful, harmonious and beautiful. The singing of the song of Moses and the Lamb by God’s people on earth is beautiful because the song is led by the Head of the temple class. This song, to those who can learn, sing and hear it, is sweet, grand and glorious.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>27</sup> Note that the prophet says: “A voice from the temple, a voice of the Lord. ’ ’ This proves that the voice which gives utterance to the message or doctrine that i$ approved proceeds from Jehovah and the one leading in the song is Christ Jesus the Head of the temple. He is now in his temple and all his holy angels are with him. The risen members of the body of Christ are also assembled with him in the temple. The approved ones on earth, being of the organization (city) of God, and members of the temple, are privileged to join in the song. It is a grand, glorious and harmonious message that flows out from Zion to the praise of Jehovah God. All in the temple are joining in this song of praise to God’s glory.—Ps. 29: 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>28</sup> Those who oppose the organization of God make to the ear a hard and splitting noise of confusion. By this it is proven that they have made themselves a part of Satan’s organization. All who are against God and his organization are anti-kingdom. It was Jesus who said: “He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattcreth abroad.” (Alatt. 12:30) The voice of noise, therefore, is a voice of antikingdom and anti-God, and Satan is using those who make this noise for his purpose and for their own destruction.—2 Thcss. 2: 9,10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>22</sup> The fact that the prophet says, “A voice from the temple, ’ ’ shows that the message makes known the judgment of God against those who oppose his house and his kingdom. The Lord is in his holy temple for judgment, and judgment must begin with those who profess to be his followers. (Ps. 11:4; 1 Pct. 4:17) The words of the prophet make this conclusion doubly sure concerning judgment upon the opposers, when he says: “A voice of the Lord that rendereth ree-ompence to his enemies.” The “servant” class is commissioned to declare ‘ ‘ the day of the vengeance of our God”, and it is therefore incumbent upon the “servant” to call attention to God’s judgment upon the opposers. It is not man’s judgment, and no man has a right even to declare it except at the command of the Lord. The prophet visualizes a company of people doing something which they claim to be doing in the name of God and to his honor but which is not according to God’s will and which God rejects. The opposition of this company is so marked against God and his organization that he takes note of it, and this fact is made known by God’s bringing these opposers into quick judgment. It seems this is necessary as a warning to others lest they become displeasing to God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>30</sup> It should not be at all difficult for anyone who loves the Lord to discern whence comes the voice of noise and what organization is giving forth the voice of the Lord from the temple. This information God gives for the comfort and encouragement of his people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>31</sup> The sixty-sixth chapter of Isaiah bears a close relation to Revelation 11:18 and 19 and also the twelfth chapter of Revelation. In the eleventh chapter of Revelation the declaration is made that the temple is open in heaven and that the time of judgment is come. Immediately follows the statement in the twelfth chapter showing the birth of the kingdom of God. Verses seven to ten of that chapter show that the universal organization of God has given birth to the kingdom, pictured by the man child, and all those of Zion are called upon to rejoice. Isaiah did not speak of the birth of the man child as if he were making a record of that fact as having then come to pass, but rather the language shows (verse 9) that Jehovah speaks sharply to those who ought to know but who refuse to believe and accept these great truths as to what God had brought to pass.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>32</sup> For some years preceding 1918 the church was expecting the coming and setting up of the kingdom. In 1914 the kingdom was born, as pictured by the man child. Thereafter, to wit, in 1918 and 1919, great travail or trouble came upon the people of God. This of itself should have caused the consecrated to look sharply for the evidence of the beginning of the kingdom; but even after 1925, when the Lord through </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> brought forth the clear testimony proving that Zion had given birth to the man child, which is the kingdom and which shall rule the world, many of those who had been of the Society refused to accept that truth and began to bitterly oppose </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> and the work of the Society. In the prophecy God seems to be saying: ‘You should have known that the day of the birth was at hand; and when I gave you the proof, why should you doubt it?’ The language of the prophet is: “Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the Lord: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? saith thy God.’’ —Isa. 66: 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>83</sup> It is a well known fact that many stumbled over this very truth concerning the birth of the nation or kingdom and became opposers of the Society. God also showed the beginning of the kingdom by the laying of the chief corner Stone in Zion, and over this the same class stumbled and fell and became opposers of God.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup>* Quickly following the announcement of the birth of the man child and the birth of the children of Zion God by his prophet calls upon all creatures of his organization to rejoice. All who love God and his organization are bidden to sing forth with joy: ‘ ‘ Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her.’’ (Isa. 66:10) Likewise Revelation, which God gave to Jesus Christ to show his servants, speaking of the same thing, says: “And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">. . . Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. ’ ’—Rev. 12:10,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>85</sup> The facts which show a fulfilment of this prophetic utterance are that when God’s children on earth were given an understanding of the birth of the kingdom there was great rejoicing among all those who really loved God. At the same time the opposers became sour and cold. The fulfilment of these prophecies, and the clear proof thereof being brought to the lovers of God, gives every reason for rejoicing. It is also certain that God permits his anointed ones to see and understand these prophecies now for theii' encouragement and comfort and strength. No one could have any real pleasure in even calling attention to the opposers of God and his organization, but this must be done for the benefit of those who love God as well as to announce God’s judgment from the temple. The knowledge of the fulfilment of these prophecies should have the effect of causing the anointed to continue to walk humbly before God and to be diligent in keeping his commandments. The fact that the prophet of God calls upon all who love him and his organization to rejoice may be taken to mean that those who do not rejoice over the fulfilment of prophecies, and who reject them, do not love God and are therefore the enemies of God and of his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>38</sup> The prophet, in verse fourteen, says: “And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb; and the hand of the Lord shall be known toward his servants, and his indignation toward his enemies.’’ Here is a promise that those children of God who see and appreciate the fulfilment of the promise shall rejoice and flourish like an herb. Thus God’s loving-kindness is made known and is exercised toward his “servant” class, while at the same time his indignation shall be toward those who oppose and who are therefore his enemies. His indignation is thus expressed in verse fifteen: “For, behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.” The same class of opposers are mentioned by the prophet in the preceding chapter. (Isa. 65:3-7) These are they to whom Jehovah had stretched out his right hand as if beseeching them to hear him and to be obedient to his commandments but who, instead of hearing the Lord, walk on in their own way.. Their disobedience provokes the Lord, and he says: “A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick. ’ ’—Isa. 65: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>37</sup> Jehovah brought to pass the facts fulfilling his prophecies, and he caused these truths to be published and sent to those who had made a covenant with him. This message was carried by those who were humbly and faithfully endeavoring to obey the Lord; but the opposers refused to hear, and refusing to hear, said to the witnesses who brought the truth: “Stand by thyself, come not near to me, for I am holier than thou.” These opposers have claimed to be the only ones approved by God and claim to be therefore holier than others, as the prophet thus foretold, and concerning them Jehovah says: “These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.”—Isa. 65: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>38</sup> A tree is a symbol of a creature, and these opposers have insisted upon giving honor and glory to the creature whom God used in his church rather than to God and to his organization. They insist that the creature brought forth all the truth by the end of A. D. 1916 and that no truth has been received since. Concerning them Jehovah caused his prophet to write: “They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens, behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the Lord.” (Vs. 17) They that withdraw themselves from God’s organization separate themselves into small companies and attempt to purify themselves by their own efforts, and to develop a beautiful character, and they deceive themselves. They that give honor and glory to the creature that was used to bring forth the truth, and then reject the progressive light of the truth, which God gives, become an abomination to him. Concerning such Jesus said: “Yc are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts; for that which is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God.”—Luke 16:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>30</sup> In Revelation 22:17 Jehovah, Christ Jesus and his bride join in the message to the people that are afar off to hear and heed the Word of God concerning salvation and his kingdom. In like manner God by his prophet Isaiah says: “For I know their works and their thoughts; it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.” (Vs. 18) The glory of the Lord shall be sung by all the people, and that is now beginning.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>40</sup> Jehovah has declared his purpose to completely vindicate his Word and name. That great work of vindication began when Christ Jesus came to the temple and began judgment. It was at that time that he found a class of consecrated ones induced by a righteous motive or heart condition to follow in the footsteps of Jesus. Because of their love for God and Christ and because of their faithfulness in the performance of their covenant up to that time the Lord there began to gather unto himself these true-hearted ones. He brought them into the temple, under the robe of righteousness, and gave unto them the garments of salvation, and made this faithful class the custodian of all his kingdom interests on earth. Then the Lord manifested his mercy toward the dreamers and indolent and the self-righteous ones, by sending them the message of truth and giving them fair warning. Those who rejected that strong warning that came from the Lord have now developed into open opposers of God and his organization. The “man of sin, the son of perdition”, is made manifest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>41</sup> Let the faithful anointed ones now have a keen appreciation of the position in which Jehovah has placed them. Let them be hearers of the Word of God and doers of his will. Let them do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly before God. To walk humbly means to be joyfully obedient to the commandments of God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>42</sup> Regardless of what others may say, do not be turned away from a whole-hearted devotion to God and his service. The greatest privilege of any creatures that have ever been on earth is that now enjoyed by the anointed of the Lord.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>43</sup> Christ Jesus stands at the head of God’s glorious organization, pictured under the symbol of Mount Zion. The anointed ones stand with him and are definitely identified as God’s children because they are wholly devoted to him. These love God, and Jehovah loves them because they are of Zion and are faithful to him. These are now privileged to join in the great message that goes forth to the nations of the earth, proclaiming that Jehovah is God, Christ is King, and that the kingdom is here. Continuing from now on faithful in the performance of their covenant these shall be granted an abundant entrance into the everlasting kingdom of our God and his Christ. That great prize will be given, not because of inherent and selfdeveloped beauty, but because of faithfulness and loving devotion to the Lord. Forever shall these faithful ones stand in the house of Jehovah, beholding his glory and beauty, and continuing to obtain knowledge and wisdom in his temple. Regardless of all manner of opposition, be very courageous henceforth. “The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his people with peace.”—Ps. 29:11.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark5"></a>WHO ARE GOD’S WITNESSES</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">J</span><span class="font6">EHOVAH is the only true God. He is the Creator and Giver of everything that is good. He is the source of life. A knowledge of him means to know the way to life, and life is what all sane persons desire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God has a mighty organization, the major portion of which is invisible to human eyes. It consists of Christ Jesus, the chief One, and a myriad of spirit creatures, and Jehovah is Head over all. It has a few members on earth amongst men. For a time the nation of Israel represented God on earth, the chief purpose in their use being to make prophetic pictures of a more potent representative whom God would have on earth. From amongst Israel God chose his faithful prophets and used them as his instruments to write down prophecy -which they did not understand, but which can now be understood because it is God’s due time to understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Among those who wrote prophecy was Isaiah. This prophecy placed alongside the events of modern history shows that the prophecy relates to the very day in which we are now living. In Isaiah 43:8 it is written: “Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.” Clearly this prophecy means that at the time of its fulfilment there would be nations of peoples having natural eyes but mentally blind; that they can hear sounds of words but they understand them not. Such condition exists today because of the divers theories that are put forth by those who claim to be teachers of the Word of God. There is great confusion amongst the people, particularly in so-called ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ ’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then adds the prophet: “Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled.” That condition now exists as never before, and now the radio makes it possible for millions to hear at one time. Then the prophet of God propounds this question: “Who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? Let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified, or let them hear [my witnesses], and say, It is [the] truth.” Then to his faithful Jehovah says: “Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah.” There is a great question at issue which must now be determined and God will have testimony given upon that question at issue. Who are the witnesses in behalf of Jehovah? Today the stronger nations of the earth constitute what is called “Christendom”, the religion of which is called “organized Christianity”, which name, as heretofore shown, is grossly misleading. The greater number of the clergymen of ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ ’ have chosen evolution and say: ‘This is a more potent God than the God of the Bible.’ Therefore Jehovah calls upon these to come forth and make proof or else hear the testimony of his witness and agree to it. A less number of clergymen, called “Fundamentalists”, teach contradictory theories of salvation; and all say: ‘Let the Christians of the world align themselves with the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">League of Nations as the savior of the world. ’ A great crisis in the affairs of men is rapidly approaching and immediately about to fall. There is therefore an imperative reason for giving testimony at this time before that great storm breaks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE TESTIMONY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah does not execute his purpose in secret. He gives due notice of his purposes. It was but a brief space of time after the expulsion of man from Eden that Satan formed a company of men and caused them to hypocritically call themselves by the name of the Lord. (Gen. 4:26) Men hurried down the road of evil. Satan also led many of the angelic sons of God into evil, causing them to leave their first estate, take on human form, and debauch the daughters of men. Because of this wickedness God determined to destroy that evil generation. (Gen. 6:7) Before doing so, he sent Noah to bear witness concerning his purpose. (2 Pet. 2: 5; 1 Pet. 3: 20) That which Noah did was prophetic and foretold what would come to pass at the end of the world. Of this there is not the slightest doubt, because Jesus so declared.—Matt. 24: 37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When God would deliver his people from the oppressive hand of the ruler of Egypt, he sent Moses and Aaron to give testimony before that ruler and the people, of and concerning his purpose. (Ex. 3:18; 4: 16; 5: 1-4; see also Exodus 6 to 12) That what was there done by Moses and Aaron, and what followed thereafter with the Israelites, was prophetic and foretold similar things which would come to pass at the end of the world, is also certain. (1 Cor. 10: 11) The prophecies fulfilled disclose two mighty organizations, to wit, God’s organization and Satan’s organization, which are at enmity and between which the war in heaven has been fought, and between which there is yet a great war to be fought, involving all the peoples of earth. It should be expected that Jehovah God would give notice of that approaching conflict by having testimony given in his own good way, of and concerning his purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ISSUE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The great question at issue for early determination by all creatures is, Who is the Almighty God? That issue must and will have a final determination, because God has so declared it. When Nimrod, under the supervision of Satan, built the tower of Babel, the purpose was to prove that Satan was equal to Jehovah God, if not greater. Jehovah destroyed that tower and confused the speech of that people that they might learn that he is the Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Egypt’s king became arrogant and oppressed God’s chosen people, the issue then was, Who is the supreme God? Jehovah demonstrated his supreme power at that time, that his name and his supremacy might be kept before his people for good, and to dem-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">onstrate to Egypt that Jehovah is God.—2 Sam. 7: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the king of Assyria appeared with arrogance before the city of Jerusalem the issue raised by him then was, Who is the supreme God? Jehovah destroyed the Assyrian army that the people might see who is supreme.—Isa. 36:18; 37: 36-38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Today the world powers of combined Christendom give allegiance to Satan the Devil, and cast reproach upon Jehovah, while hypocritically claiming to be followers of Christ; and now the great issue is, Who is the Almighty God, and whom shall we obey? Jehovah has expressed his determination that the issue shall be settled, and that shortly; but before doing so, he will cause testimony to be given before the nations and peoples of the world of and concerning his purpose, to the end that the rulers and people may have an opportunity to know the truth; and further, that all mouths will be for ever stopped from saying that they had no opportunity to know. That the giving of such testimony should immediately precede the final determination of the great issue of the battle of Armageddon is made sure by the words of Jesus Christ, the great Prophet of Jehovah God: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. ’ ’—Matt. 24:14, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fact that God would have this testimony given before the great time of trouble is proof that he would thereby furnish a warning to, as well as an opportunity for, those who hear to profit by the facts, break away from Satan’s organization, and seek safety under the power and protection of Jehovah. It is equally certain that Satan would do everything within his power to keep the rulers and the people from hearing the testimony, to the end that he might hold them in his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WHO WILL TESTIFY?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Testimony is given by witnesses, detailing certain facts that bear upon the issue. Who will be witnesses on the earth to testify to the name of Jehovah God as the Almighty One? That question can be determined by ascertaining whom God has used on former occasions when he would bring his name before creation. Jehovah puts his spirit upon men whom he sends to deliver his message of truth. That means that they are authorized to speak in his name. He endows such with power from on high to act as witnesses for him. His spirit is his invisible power operating according to his sovereign will. (2 Pet. 1:21) It is quite evident that God caused a record to be made of what he did in the past, to enable men to better understand what he will do in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When God organized Israel into his prophetic organization he provided the priesthood to serve that people, and he caused the priests to be anointed with holy oil, thus indicating authority and approval from Jehovah. The holy oil was a representation of the holy spirit of God with which he anoints those who act in his behalf. Among other duties that must be performed by the priests of that time was that they were required to teach the people by informing them concerning God’s law and his purposes. (Mal. 2:7) The priests of that organization prophetically foretold a similar class that would serve his real organization ‘when Zion is builded up’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Through his prophet God foretold the coming of his mighty Son Christ Jesus, the great Prophet of Jehovah. Concerning the work that He was to do, the prophet wrote: “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn.’’ (Isa.-61:1, 2) When Jesus began his earthly work he took up the book containing that prophecy, read it in the hearing of others, and applied it to himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘ ‘ The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.’’ (Luke 4:18, 19, 21) The fact that, in reading the prophecy at that time, Jesus omitted the words, “and the day of vengeance of our God,” must be significant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He knew that he would come again, and that at his second coming and the end of the world the “vengeance of our God” should be told to the people before that great and terrible day; and this conclusion is fully supported by what he subsequently said to his disciples. (Matt. 24:14,21) In the period of time elapsing from Pentecost until the coming to his temple and the building up of Zion, his body members would be selected and gathered unto him. The last of these would constitute the “feet of him” and must therefore perform the duties designated by the authority of their anointing.—Isa. 52:7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For three and a half years Jesus gave testimony before the people and the rulers, telling of God’s purposes. When he stood before Pilate and responded to the questions concerning his mission on the earth and whether or not he was a king, he said: “To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth hcareth my voice.” (John 18: 37) Thus he proved his mission to be that of the great Witness or Prophet of God, and that all who are really of the truth must hear and obey his voice and must be witnesses together with him.—Luke 24: 48.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the titles given unto Jesus by Jehovah is “the faithful and true witness”. (Rev. 3:14) It is also stated that his body members must be like him. (Rom. S: 29) This likeness must of necessity consist in this, that his body members would be wholly and unreservedly devoted to Jehovah God and delight in keeping his commandments. That would mean that they must be witnesses for Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“A PEOPLE FOR HIS NAME”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s purpose in having the gospel preached from the time of Pentecost until the coming of Christ Jesus to his temple was to take out from among men “a people for his name”. The wily enemy Satan early began to carry on his campaign to offset God’s purpose. Well knowing that he must operate by fraud and deceit, he projected into the minds of the leaders in the earthly organization of the church the conclusion that the mission of the church is to convert the world and to robe it in glory and beauty in preparation for the second coming of Christ Jesus. Satan knew that men could not do this, but that to follow that course would keep them busy and would hide God’s real purpose from their understanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Rome adopted a religion and named it the “Christian religion”, the leaders then began to carry on a great campaign to compel the people to become members of that church. That meant that Satan had gotten control of the organization and had made that organization the “religion” of his organization, therefore had made it a part of Babylon. Those who would not yield to this influence were subjected to all manner of cruel treatment and torture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The real purpose of the church was entirely lost to the sight of honest persons, and such was the result of Satan’s evil influence. As the Pharisees were blind guides to the blind people when Jesus was on earth, even so the clergy, who are the counterpart of the Pharisees, became the blind guides of the people in t he church, who likewise were blinded to the truth by .Satan's course of action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the conditions in the Roman church became intolerable, some of the most honest ones broke away to form what is known as the Protestant church. The Protestants also fell under the seductive influence of •Satan, misconceived the purpose of the church, and believed it to be their duty to convert the world to Protestantism. As a result thereof, many bloody wars followed, especially in Europe, between the Catholic and Protestant church organizations. Both of these great organizations participated freely in the politics of the world and really became a part of the ruling factors. The truth was hid to them. This condition of misconception of the purpose of the church continued until the second coming of the Lord and the beginning of the restoration of the fundamental doctrines of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the period of time from 1878 forward the work of restoring the truth to the seekers therefor was carried on, which work was prophetically foretold by the course of action that Elijah took. In that period of time many withdrew from the Catholic and Protestant church organizations and joyfully embraced the truth; but some of the former errors clung to them. These errors are represented by the prophet as “the filthy garments” that were brought away with those who separated themselves from Babylon. Many of those who thus came to a knowledge of the truth and withdrew from the Catholic and Protestant organizations believed and proceeded upon the theory that their chief duty was to prepare themselves for heaven. To this end they set about to develop a sweet and beautiful character and to call the attention of others to the necessity of so doing. That they were honest in this, no one will question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course it was right for them to believe that the Lord would give the faithful overcomers a part with him in his kingdom; and it was right for them to believe that they must be pure in thought, in word, and in action so far as possible; but they overlooked a work that must first be done by the followers of Christ while on the earth. Every Christian should lead a blameless life and put forth his best endeavors to always do that which is right; but that is not all that he must do. No man can by his own efforts become so good and perfect that by reason thereof he would be fit to reign with Christ in his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The condition precedent to entering into that kingdom is love for and faithfulness unto Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. Such love is proven by joyfully keeping the commandments of God. (John 14:15, 21; 1 John 4:17,18; 5:3) That means that the overcomers are unselfishly devoted to the Lord and his cause and refuse to compromise, either directly or indirectly, with any part of the Devil’s organization. Those who are thus faithful to the end will be granted the crown of life and a place with Christ Jesus in his kingdom of heaven. The Christian cannot be faithful and true and at the same time neglect or ignore the commandments of Jehovah God. His delight will be to keep those commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah reveals to man the meaning of his Word progressively. “The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.” (Prov. 4:18) The apostles began to see and understand God’s purpose at the time they were anointed with the holy spirit at Pentecost, but thereafter they saw more clearly. Likewise the Lord’s people gradually saw the truth as it was restored, and after the the Lord came to his temple they began to see it more clearly, and the light still continues to increase upon God’s Word. When Jesus was on earth he restricted his preaching to the Jews alone. For three and a half years thereafter his disciples taught the Jews exclusively. The religion of the Jews had become a formalism, as a result of the unfaithfulness of the clergy and leaders therein. For some time after Pentecost much of that formalism was held on to by the disciples of Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A convention of the disciples of Jesus was held in Jerusalem to consider these questions. James, one of the disciples of the Lord, was the chairman of that convention. In the course of the discussion Peter related how God had sent the gospel by him to the Gentiles, and that now there is no distinction between Jew and Gentile so far as God’s Word and purpose are concerned. Then Paul and Barnabas addressed the convention and told what miracles and wonders God had wrought amongst the Gentiles by them. In summing up the matter James gave utterance to prophetic words. Harmonizing his own words with those of God’s prophet Amos, James said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build the ruins thereof, and I will set it up; that the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things. Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.” (Acts 15:7-18) Thus he showed that it was a part of God’s purpose from the beginning to take out “a people for his name” and, this done, then he would build up Zion, set his kingdom in operation (which was prophetically shown by the reign of David), and then the kingdom blessings would be extended to all the families of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The statement of James is a prophecy which could not be clearly understood until after it was fulfilled or in course of fulfilment. Since the opening of the temple in 1918 those of the temple class now clearly see that Jehovah God takes out a people for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font6"> name, and that this must be done before the restoration blessings of all the families of the earth begin. It must be clearly implied from this that God has a specific work for those so taken out to perform while yet on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Satan’s organization has cast great reproach upon the name of Jehovah God. This is particularly true in modern times. “Organized Christianity” is really a formalistic religion. This organization has taken on the name of Christ and claims to be Christian, but the course of action taken by the organization does violence and dishonor to the name of Christ and to the name of Jehovah God. The leaders and members draw near to the Lord with their lip service, but they have no heart devotion to him. They use the name of the Lord, but with no real understanding. Satan has used the organization and the formalistic practices therein to blind the people to the truth and turn them away from God. God now discloses his purpose to bring his name prominently before the people, and therefore he takes out from among the professed Christians a people whom he uses for his name’s sake and who will give testimony to the greatness of his name. His great name must be properly set before the people, because the only way for them to obtain life is to know him, the true God, and Christ Jesus, whom he has sent into the world as Savior. (John 17:3) God selects a people and anoints them and authorizes them to give testimony concerning his name before the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Egypt was Satan’s organization, and the people of God in bondage and under the oppression of Egypt’s ruler prophetically foretold the peoples of earth in bondage to Satan and his wicked organization at the present time. Before delivering the Israelites from Egyptian bondage, God called Moses and, sending with him Aaron to do the speaking, directed Moses as to the message which must be given to Pharaoh. ‘ * Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth. For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth. And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth. ’ ’—Ex. 9:13-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the sight of men Pharaoh seemed to do as he pleased in defiance of Jehovah God. To the demand made by Moses Pharaoh replied: “Who is [Jehovah], that I should obey his voice?” Because of such defiance it became necessary for Jehovah to set his name right before the people, and that for man’s benefit. Therefore the Scriptures mark out those conditions and circumstances as foretelling the things which must come to pass at the end of the world, when the affairs of men and nations come to a great crisis. Upon this earth at the present time there exists a condition clearly foretold by the conditions then in Egypt. Never before in human history since the days of Pharaoh until the present time has there been anything that could so well fit the prophetic course of Egypt. That which God did to Egypt at that time to make a name for himself foretold the manner in which he will make his name known before all his creation at the end of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God declares through his prophet his purpose to visit “organized Christianity” with a time of trouble such as man has never known. God will not take this action, however, without giving due notice. The time for serving such notice, or for the testimony to be given, he indicates must be shortly preceding the great trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To accomplish his work in giving such notice God must have some instrument or some persons to be his witnesses. The work corresponds to that which was done by Moses. The people are kept in ignorance and oppressed, and now the Lord will take action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At this time God has not raised up an individual to do his work, but he has raised up a company of faithful followers of Christ Jesus, whom he names his “servant”. Those who go to make up this “servant” are the ones found faithful and approved by the Lord at the time of coming to his temple, and to such he has committed the work of giving the testimony; and God commissioned them thus to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people taken out for the name of Jehovah must be the ones whom he uses and will use to inform the rulers and the people concerning his purposes. Having come to Zion, and having built it up and brought his approved ones into the temple condition, the Lord informs them that there is a work for them to do, and that such work consists in giving testimony to the name of Jehovah God and in speaking forth his purposes concerning the evil organization and his purposes concerning the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The clergy of “organized Christianity” repudiate the Word of God, teach the theories of men, and extol the virtues and achievements of men and man-made organizations, and the result is that the peoples have been blinded to the understanding of the truth. The Lord’s time has come to reveal his prophetic words and he brings forth a company of men and women who are fully devoted to him and uses them as his witnesses to tell the people the truth. These come to you with a simple message of God’s Word which enables you to decide whether you wish to be longer led by the blind guides of “organized Christianity” or to look into the Scriptures for yourself. The message these men and women bring to your doors proves that Jehovah is the only true God, and that the Bible is his Word of truth. They bring to you books that contain, not the theories of men, but a statement of the historical facts compared with the prophecies of God by which you can determine the reason for the present unsatisfactory conditions and what shall shortly come to pass. By bringing to you these books they are preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom, not for hire nor to build up an earthly organization, but solely because they love God and delight to obey his commandments and have a desire to do you good. For your welfare and peace of mind it is strongly recommended that you give a hearing ear to what they shall say to you and then decide the matter for yourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You have long desired to understand the book of Revelation. The Lord has now caused that great prophecy to be fulfilled. These witnesses will tell you how to get an understanding of it, and when you do understand you will have a real blessing. The knowledge of God’s Word will do more to reduce the crime wave throughout the land than all the commissions or boards that the president of the United States can possibly appoint. God’s witnesses bring to you this truth. Do your part to obtain an understanding thereof, and then help others to understand. You owe it to yourselves, your families, and your neighbors thus to do.</span></p>

To my mind the outstanding feature is the soon-to-be destruction of the old “wench” (“organized religion”) now so odious that even the other elements of the Devil’s organization consider it expedient to be rid of her and “hate the whore” and will ‘make her desolate and naked, eat her flesh, and burn her with fire’.—Rev. 17: 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I am always in the field when you speak on the chain, but Sunday an opportunity -was afforded to make an exception for which I was grateful. You evidently anticipate that her overthrow cannot be long delayed. Persons not of the anointed remarked that the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">power</span><span class="font5"> of last Sunday’s utterance was the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">power</span><span class="font5"> of the Lord and his truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I find absolutely no statements in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font5"> based merely on human assumption. No interpretation is attempted except the Scripture is available to supply such interpretation. While this is true of all the preceding books, the very nature of the subject makes it outstandingly in evidence in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light.</span><span class="font5"> Now when we go to the people we are provided with a strong appeal that I am confident will be appreciated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">You have long time wondered why the book of Itevelatiou was ever written and what could be the significance of its strange symbols. Nobody could know before the time they wore fulfilled or about to be fulfilled. We know we have the key if it unlocks our door. These books present the words of the Bible about things that have taken place in the world during our lifetime concerning matters we are all interested to know. When you read these books you will KNOW that the LIGHT on these matters could not possibly come from human wisdom. Only God and the Bible could provide LIGHT on these matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">More than ever, dear Brother Rutherford, I feel that we have in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font5"> the subject matter that many will be interested in reading. I have always felt that the last published book provides the knowledge that makes the preceding books understandable and recommend that the books be read in order the reverse of that in which they are printed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Workers have felt disheartened as they find books unread. The Lord evidently has his own method of creating conditions that will conduce to the reading of the books we have already placed. I anticipate that as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font5"> goes forth at the same time that everybody will be compelled to see the fulfilment of the very things it portrays so graphically there will be a reading and even study of the books as never before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In what contrast is Jehovah’s love for his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">friends</span><span class="font5"> with his judgments upon his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">enemies. Was ever a</span><span class="font5"> book written that revealed it so fully as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is hard to write briefly. Such a flood of gratitude overflows. I thank you, dear Brother Rutherford, for the books, and the dear Lord for the privilege of living in this wonderful day of opportunities, and am more than ever determined to faithfully do my share in that which must be done </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">speedily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yours in the love and joy of the Lord,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">M. L. </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Herr.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark7"></a>SERVICE CONVENTIONS</span></h3>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font6">LL of God’s anointed on earth are a part of God’s organization. All the work of his anointed should be orderly, that the best results may be obtained. Coming together for consultation and encouragement and to strengthen the organization is for the well-being of the anointed and the Lord’s work. The fact that there are different languages spoken amongst the anointed in the same vicinity should not separate them in these conventions. The Society is therefore arranging for week-end conventions, to be held at stated intervals at certain points. Therefore all the anointed of all classes and languages within a radius of sixty miles of the city or point where the convention is held will please convene together so far as it is possible. It would be well if these meetings are attended by colporteurs, sharpshooters, class workers, and all others who have a real interest in the Lord's work. The great and important questions before the church will be considered and the brethren instructed how they can best perform the terms of their covenant unto the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Each one of these conventions will be under the general supervision of the Society. A chairman will be selected by the Society, and the programs made out by the Society. The chairman will have general supervision of the assembly, and the regional service director will direct the field work. Where there are various languages spoken and some cannot understand the English, an effort will be made to have special meetings held for such and a competent brother speaking the language assigned to serve, or an interpreter provided to interpret the English speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those desiring to communicate with the representative of the convention will please address their communications to the service director of the ecclesia where the convention is to be held, whose name and address will appear in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> when the convention is fixed. The service director will work in conjunction with the regional service director in preparing for the convention and the activities in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All these conventions will open on Friday evening, with an address by the chairman or some person assigned for that purpose; and then will be given instructions concerning the work in the field for the day following. From nine o’clock Saturday morning until 2:30 Saturday afternoon will be devoted to field service. At 3:30 Saturday afternoon there will be a talk to the assembly on some up-to-date subject, discussed as treated in a recent issue of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower.</span><span class="font6"> A similar course of activity will be followed on Sundays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the suggestion is made that discourses be on subjects discussed in the recent issues of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1'he Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> the purpose is, not to take the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span><span class="font6"> and read it literally, but to consider the matter in harmony</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font6">with the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span><span class="font6"> and tu support what is set forth and explain it more fully. The brethren should remember that now the most important thing for consideration is God’s kingdom. That involves a better knowledge of Jehovah and of his beloved Son as well as of the setting up of the kingdom. The conventions so arranged will enable brethren to get a better view of their privileges in connection with the kingdom interests. There is much to be done, and great is the privilege to have a part in that work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The year 1931 should make the best record ever yet in giving the witness which the Lord has commanded shall be given. It is hoped that every one in the vicinity of these conventions will take a keen interest in seeing that the coming together is an honor to the. Lord and a blessing to those who attend. Following are set forth a number of conventions that have already been arranged. Later another list will be published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We earnestly request that the brethren avoid having other conventions or assemblies in these districts that would conflict with the ones herein named. Let us all work together to the glory of the Lord and to the advancement of his cause.</span></p>
