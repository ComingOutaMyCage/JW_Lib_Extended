<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark1"></a>THIS JOURNAL</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font3">HIS journal is published for the purpose of aiding the people to understand Jehovah’s purposes. It provides systematic Bible study in which all its readers may regularly engage. It gives announcement of the visits made to Bible classes by traveling speakers, announces conventions, and gives reports thereof. It announces radio programs and publishes suitable Bible instruction for broadcasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It adheres strictly to the Bible as God’s revealed Word of Truth. It stands firmly upon the great ransom sacrifice as the fundamental doctrine by which all doctrines are measured. It is free from parties, sects and creeds of men. It does not assume a dogmatic attitude, but confidently invites a careful examination of its utterances in the light of the infallible Word, of God. It does not indulge in controversies, and its columns are not open to personalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, the Maker of heaven and earth, and is from everlasting to everlasting; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation; that the Logos became a man; that he is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and in earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT GOD created the earth for man, and created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrongful act all men are born sinners and Without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JESUS was made a human being in order that he might become the Redeemer of man; that he gave his life a sacrifice for man and thereby produced the ransom price; that Jesus the divine was raised from the dead, ascended into heaven, and presented the value of his human sacrifice as the redemptive price for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT FOR MANY CENTURIES God, through Christ, has been selecting from amongst men the members of his church, which constitutes the body of Christ; that the mission of the church is to follow in the footsteps of her Lord Christ Jesus, grow in his likeness, give testimony to the name and purpose of Jehovah God, and ultimately be glorified with Christ Jesus in his heavenly kingdom; that Christ, Head and body, constitutes the “seed of Abraham’’ through which all families of the earth shall be blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE WORLD HAS ENDED; that the Lord Jesus has returned and is now present; that Jehovah has placed Christ Jesus upon his throne and now commands all nations and peoples to hear and obey him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE HOPE OF THE PEOPLES of earth is restoration to human perfection during the reign of Christ; that the reign of Christ will afford opportunity to every man to have a fair trial for life, and those who obey will live on earth for ever in a state of happiness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ADVERTISING WATCHTOWER CHAIN PROGRAM</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To send the Sunday morning chain program to much of the most densely populated area of the country a large sum of money is being spent continually by the Society. The hour’s program is now broadcast over a chain of thirty stations, including</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Bangor, Me.........WLBZ &nbsp;New York ........ WMCA</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Reports of field workers indicate an intense and steadily growing interest among listeners. During the chain program, announcement is made regularly that further information in printed form “will be offered by a representative from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3"> who will call at your home’’. As a result, workers find that many who have heard the program are eagerly waiting for the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On the other hand, millions of people in the area now served by this broadcasting DO NOT KNOW that there is such a program on the air. The most effective advertisement is the personal invitation. This can bo given constantly by each field worker in a definite manner by use of the radio slip. Mere mention of the program when canvassing is good, of course, but uncertain, for the spoken word is soon forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The radio slip is an attractive folder, printed in two colors. It contains a list of the stations on one side and, on the other side, a brief description and illustration of the books. These slips are supplied by the Society at one dollar a thousand. They are for free distribution to every home by each worker while engaged in the house-to-house service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NOTICE OF ANNUAL MEETING</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pursuant to the provision of law and the charter of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, the annual business meeting of the said Society will be held at Pittsburgh, North Side (formerly Allegheny), Pennsylvania, at 2509 Perrysville Avenue, at 10 o'clock a.m. Friday, October 31, 1930, at which the usual annual business will be transacted.</span></p><img src="w_E_19301001_files/w_E_19301001-2.png" alt="" style="width:487pt;height:56pt;"><a name="caption2"></a>

<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark5"></a>STAND FIRM</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">“And </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.”—2 Thess. 2:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH has pronounced his judgment against ‘the workers of lawlessness’. That judgment, written long centuries ago, will be understood and appreciated in advance of its execution by those of the chosen “servant” class, and by that class alone. To that chosen class Jehovah says: “Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.” (Isa. 42:9) Surely one of the reasons why the Lord tells the chosen ones of these approaching things concerning judgments is that they might be forewarned and ‘keep themselves in the love of God’. (Jude 21) Jehovah has also written his judgment concerning the faithful ones. He has laid down the rules by which the faithful are to be identified, and the terms and conditions they must meet, and he has left to Jesus the work of determining who meets or measures up to those requirements. (John 5: 22; 2 Cor. 5:10) One of these fixed rules is that those who partake of the great salvation do so ‘through the sanctification of the spirit and a belief of the truth’. Others who have received the truth, and who have received not the love of the truth, will be swept away by a strong delusion and upon such the judgment is adverse. To be forewarned, therefore, better equips the remnant to stand firm against all assaults of the enemy. God has graciously made this provision for them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> In a preceding issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font4"> the proof is submitted showing that the “man of sin” is not the papal system, but is the “evil servant”. So important is this matter to the church at this very time that it is deemed both proper and necessary to make some further observations from the Scriptures bearing upon the question, to the end that the chosen ones may be better equipped for the severe test. There can be no doubt that the remnant must preach the gospel of the kingdom during a time of great opposition from the enemy. This opposition will continue until the work is done. Referring to that same time Jesus said: “And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. ’ ’—Matt. 24:11-13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> There are two important things concerning which the remnant dare not permit themselves to be deceived, to wit: (1) The coming of the Lord Jesus to his temple; and (2) their “gathering together unto him”. Before the latter is an accomplished fact or completed there must come a falling away and the “man of sin” be disclosed. A great test upon the remnant may be expected to follow.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REBELLION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘ It is well settled from the Scriptures and from the facts that approximately A.D. 1875 marks the time when Christ Jesus began to ‘prepare the way before the Lord’ and a part of this work, at least, consisted in doing the work foreshadowed by the Prophet Elijah, that is to say, the restoring of the fundamental truths to the called ones. Until that restoration work was completed there would be nothing from which to fall away. That restoration work was accomplished by 1914, approximately, when God set his beloved One upon his throne. Neither the papacy nor the protestant system of religion could possibly be included in the class “falling away”, because the fundamental truths were never restored to them. The word “apostasy”, appearing in some of the translations, docs not convej<sup>r</sup> the meaning as fully and strongly as it really is. The word ‘rebellion’ seems much more appropriate, and one of the translators thus renders the text: “Except the revolt come first.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font4"> Lucifer rebelled against God’s organization centuries ago, and the coming of the “man of sin” shall be “according to an inworking of Satan”. It therefore means a rebellion against God and his organization. The words of Paul locate that rebellion “in the latter times”, or “last days”, where we now are. (1 Tim. 4:1-3) Furthermore, the statement, ‘ ‘ Except the revolt come first ’ ’ and ‘ ‘ that man of sin be revealed”, proves that the “man of sin” is made up of or composed of those who fall away or rebel against God and his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“All men are sinners by nature; therefore the use of</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the term “man of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">sin’’</span><span class="font4"> must refer to something more than ordinary sin and for which the blood of Christ does not make atonement. Hence it is a sin unto death (1 John 5:16); the sin against the holy spirit (Matt. 12: 31, 32) ; the sin not openly manifest at the beginning, but coming to the surface afterward (1 Tim. 5: 22, 24, 25); a sin of respecting the persons of leaders (Jas. 2:9); and otherwise designated “the greater sin” (John 19:11); the sin forbidding the speaking of God’s message now and to the Gentile nations (1 Thess. 2:16); a sin committed by those once enlightened and who draw back unto perdition. (Heb. 10:39) This last scripture shows that there could be no worse sinners than those who were once enlightened and called and who responded to the call for the kingdom and then draw back and rebel against God and his kingdom. Such constitute the Judas class. The word “Judas” is from the same root as “Judah”, and means “praise unto God”. Judas first sang praises unto Jehovah and then drew back and put himself in opposition to God, and he was thereafter called “the son of perdition”, and likewise is the “man of sin” named.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OPPOSERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> Understanding that the “day of Christ” began when Jesus came to the temple of God, in 1918, it appears that the rebellion must precede that day. The beginning of the falling away or rebellion against God’s organization would also mark the beginning of the disclosure of the ‘ ‘ man of sin ’ ’, even though none of God’s children then on earth understood the matter. The Revelation which God gave to Jesus Christ to show to his “servant” began to be disclosed particularly from 1914 forward, but none of God’s children on earth had an understanding thereof for fifteen years or more thereafter. They did see the evidence of things coming to pass which mark a fulfilment of Revelation, but they did not discern the meaning thereof. Likewise the faithful have for some years seen the manifestation of lawlessness and now begin to discern the meaning of the term the ‘ ‘ man of sin ’ ’.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> When 1914 arrived there were those in the then present truth who were looking for the kingdom of God to be set up and that they themselves would be made prominent in that kingdom. They confidently expected to be suddenly taken into the kingdom in 1914. That year passed and the selfish ones were disappointed and said: “My Lord dclayeth his coming.” The ‘rebellion’, or “falling away”, began there and reached a culminating point in 1917. Thereafter the Lord Jesus began ‘to gather together unto himself’ all those whom he found faithful, and these he invited to enter into his joy, and he increased their opportunities for service. Those who fell away then and since have rebelled against God’s organization and opposed the world-wide witness service to the name of Jehovah and concerning his vengeance against Satan’s organization. They have not been content to remain inactive, but have busied themselves in open opposition to the work being done in obedience to God’s commandments.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> Relating to that time Paul under inspiration wrote: “Who opposeth [that is, opposeth God] and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped.” When the Lord came to his temple and chose the approved ones he set before them the great door of opportunity to preach ‘this gospel of the kingdom to all the nations’. The faithful were eager to obey that, and did obey that commandment. Many who had once been enlightened and walked with them now became open opposers. As it was in Paul’s day, even so like conditions existed after the Lord came to his temple. “For a great and effective door has been opened to me; yet there are many opposers.” (1 Cor. 16:9, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott)</span><span class="font4"> It has been quite difficult for some whose faith has not been so strong to withstand the opposition. Others, with greater faith, have grown stronger with the opposition warring against them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>9</sup> The “man of sin” by his course of action “opposeth and exalteth himself on high against every one called God”. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font4"> This he does by putting himself above what God’s commandments require. He puts himself above Jesus Christ and exempts himself from being God’s witness. Jesus was and is the Faithful and True Witness of Jehovah, and he has committed a portion of the testimony to his faithful followers and commands them to go forth and give a witness. The opposers set themselves up above Jesus Christ, refuse to obey the commandments and to bear the reproaches that came upon Jesus. They refuse to be “subject unto the higher powers”, to wit, Jehovah and Jesus and the inspired apostles who set forth the commandments to God’s people; and claim that “the higher powers” has reference to the governments of Satan’s world. They are thus deceived and deceive themselves.—Matt. 10: 24; Rom. 13:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> Refusing to obey the Lord, those composing the “man of sin” attempt justification of themselves for their course of action and take credit to themselves, and also claim self-beautification in so-called “character development” rather than the vindication of God’s name, and they engage in creature worship and in self-admiration. (1 Cor. 4:6) They speak wickedly against God’s children of the covenant and make themselves judges of God’s law, and thus are in opposition to God and all that is called God.—Ps. 50: 20; Jas. 4:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> God’s people are called by his name. (Jer. 15:16; Rev. 3:12; John 10:34-36) The anointed sons of God stand as his representatives because to them has been committed the testimony of Jesus Christ which they arc commanded to tell. If these are doing the work God has commanded them to do, then those who oppose that work and the workers are opposing God and that which is called by God’s name. Such opposition is manifested by the “evil servant”. (Matt. 24:48-51; Luke 12:45,46) He is “a foolish shepherd”, an “idol shepherd, that leaveth the flock”. (Zech. 11:15-17) He idolizes himself and other creatures and leaves God and Christ in the background of his vision and forsakes the work which God has commanded his people to do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> All features of God’s law through Moses were matters of devotion to God. Whatsoever God has constituted for his purpose should have respect because it is God’s instrument. God has selected those that go to make up his temple and has anointed them and has sent them forth to do his service. To oppose that work and the service thereof is to oppose God. For this reason he caused to be written: ‘ ‘ Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets [witnesses] no harm.” (Ps. 105:15) To take away from God’s Word or add thereto is surely an offense against that which is worshiped. These opposers set up the “commandments of men, that turn from the truth”, and they obey not God. “They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.” —Titus 1:14,16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> ‘So that he [the man of sin] as a god [mighty one] seats himself in the temple of God. ’ This he does by assuming to teach and to represent God and to judge contrary to God’s Word, and hence acts out of order, is lawless, and is therefore gathered out from those who are for the kingdom.—Matt. 13:41,42; John 8:2; 19:13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“HIS TIME”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> God sent forth the holy spirit to act for and in behalf of all his sons who had responded to the call for the kingdom and during the absence of Jesus from the earth. During all that period of time the mystery of iniquity or lawlessness was at work. Satan was breeding and nourishing that lawlessness, and had it not been for the restraining power of the holy spirit the “man of sin” would have been manifested much sooner. It must be revealed in his due time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> With the coming of the Lord to his temple there was no further need for the administration of the holy spirit as a comforter, helper or advocate. The Elijah work was done and the administration of the holy spirit in the capacity of helper and advocate was finished. The due time for the “wicked” to “be revealed” was after the beginning of the Elisha work of the church. Those who had formed the “man of sin” once had the spirit of the Elijah work, but they no longer have it. They did not receive the double portion of the spirit of Elijah that was to come and did come upon those represented by Elisha, and hence they have refused to do the Elisha work and go even further in open opposition to it. The spirit of God no longer hinders the Devil, who brings forth the lawless “man of sin”, and he is revealed and begins his opposition to God and his work.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ACCORDING TO SATAN’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>16</sup> It is written that the “man of sin” is “after the working of Satan”. “That one [wicked one] whose arrival is due to Satan’s activity.</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">’’{Moffatt)</span><span class="font4"> “Whose coming is according to the energy of the Adversary. ’ ’ </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">{Diaglott)</span><span class="font4"> “Whose coming is according to the working of Satan.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">{R. V.)</span><span class="font4"> “Whose presence shall be according to an inworking of Satan.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">{Rotherham) </span><span class="font4">(2 Thess. 2:9) These various translations further prove that the “man of sin” carries out Satan’s scheme of opposing the work of God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>17</sup> Satan having been cast out of heaven and to the earth and being no longer restrained by the- operation of the holy spirit, this shield to the called ones is taken away and Satan enters into the wicked one as he did into Judas. (John 13: 27) “That wicked one,” or “that man of sin”, does not have the “spirit of . . . power, and of love, and of a sound mind” that proceeds from God (2 Tim. 1:7); but he has the enemy’s power. Satan uses all his power against the remnant; hence, says Paul, “ [He works] with all power [his power] and signs and lying wonders”; and by these he deceives many. Such seek to cause division among God’s faithful witnesses, and in so doing they employ Satan’s methods: “For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly [selfish interests] ; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.” (Rom. 16:16-18) The Lord’s people are warned against such and are plainly told to avoid them. They often plant themselves in close proximity to the Lord’s faithful remnant and by employing soft words and deception attempt to draw the faithful away from their work and devotion to God’s organization. The Lord through the apostle warns his witnesses to avoid such because they are deadly enemies working with slyness and subtlety, like unto Satan.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY DECEIVED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> It seems quite clear that those composing that company, or the “man of sin”, are first deceived and then used as an instrument of deception. Their own selfish motive laid them open to the assaults and deceptions of Satan. They accepted the truth and fed upon it, but with a selfish desire for some personal profit. The truth they received during the period of the Elijah work of the church, and their love for it was for what it might bring to them personally. Undoubtedly they had the truth; otherwise they could not have fallen away.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>19</sup> But they fell away ‘ ‘ because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved”. Without a question of doubt, a mere knowledge of the truth is not sufficient to save anyone. There must be a joyful obedience to the truth. The Devil surely knows much of the truth. It is -written: “Devils also believe, and tremble. But wilt thou know, 0 vain man, that faith without works is dead?’’ (Jas. 2:19, 20) Devils are extremely selfish and take advantage of the truth to accomplish their wicked purposes. Anyone who receives the truth for a selfish purpose and thus holds it lays himself open to the arts of the enemy.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> During the Elijah period of the church many made a covenant of consecration with the Lord and said in substance: ‘I have consecrated for the kingdom, and I expect to be taken to heaven and reign with Christ and help him rule the world; I am developing a character like that of the Lord so that God will use me in the kingdom.’ Such were looking for whatever they might get in the -way of a high position and honor rather than to magnify Jehovah and the honor of his name. The kingdom interests were committed to them and they did not unselfishly use the opportunity to further those interests. They loved themselves, and loved the truth that they had received because it was good for themselves, and they expected to receive a great reward; but they “received not the love </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font4"> the truth”. They were in line for the kingdom because they had responded to the call; but they had not the love of the truth, and when the test came they were easily offended against God and willing to work contrary to his commandments, and they were deceived, and the Lord sent forth his angels and gathered them out of the kingdom.—Matt. 13:41,42.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> The heart is the seat of motive, otherwise called the seat of love. When one accepts the call for the kingdom by responding to the call the issue is then life or death with such a one. It is written: “Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.” (Prov. 4:23) God has not called any to the kingdom merely to get them into heaven, but he has called them that they might show fortli his praises. If the called ones are chiefly concerned about their own selfish interests and are not devoted to God they open themselves to the assaults of the Devil and easily fall. No one can be saved and taken into the kingdom who has not received the love of the truth. Receiving the truth and failing to use it to the honor of the Lord leads to perdition.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHERS DECEIVED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> Some who speak evilly of the work of the Lord which is being carried on by the Society and who slander their brethren without a cause have the brazenness to attend the Memorial of the Lord’s death and partake of the emblems with those whom they have sought and are seeking to destroy. Surely they have not received the love of the truth; otherwise they would not take such a course.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> The spirit of God produces a fruit which is called love. “The fruit of the spirit is love.” (Gal. 5:22) Selfishness is the very opposite of love and makes manifest the works of the flesh, and no one who holds a knowledge of the truth in selfishness can inherit the kingdom of God. (Gal. 5:19-21) The truth received into a good and honest heart engenders or develops unselfishness, which is love, and ‘brings forth fruit with patience’. (Luke 8:15) It must therefore follow that if one has not a good and honest heart, which means a pure and unselfish motive, the truth could not have developed in him the fruit of the spirit, which is love. He therefore does not receive the love of the truth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> Those who receive the truth and receive also the love of the truth, and who hold that love of the truth, have the fruit of the spirit. Such prove their love for God, the Author of all truth, by gladly keeping his commandments. There is no other way to prove one’s love for God. “For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are not burdensome. ’ ’—1 John 5: 3, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> Since 1918 the judgment has been on, and it is positively and plainly written that those who love God will have boldness in proclaiming the truth in that time; and it follows that those who oppose the proclamation of the message of truth have not the love of God and not the love of the truth. (1 John 4:17,18) The proper appreciation of the truth produces unselfishness in the heart that is honest toward God, and that child of God is anxious to tell others of the truth, that the name of God may be honored. But if one receives the truth and holds it selfishly and looks to what he can obtain thereby for himself, he has not the love of the truth and he will not abide the day of the examination, the day of the coming of the Lord to his temple. In this connection Jesus said: “No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light. For nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid that shall not be known and come abroad. Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he sccmeth to have.” —Luke 8:16-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>26</sup> The light of the truth is from God, and one who receives it desires it to shine out from him that he might have a part in giving honor to God’s holy name. One receiving the truth and holding it selfishly, when the Lord comes to his temple he takes away everything from the selfish one and gives it to the unselfish one. —Matt. 25: 28, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>27</sup> The reports show that in the United States less than half of those who partake of the Memorial avail themselves of opportunities of sendee by bearing the fruits of the kingdom to others. Doubtless some are physically incapacitated or otherwise unavoidably hindered from actively engaging in the service, and, if so, surely the Lord will take that into consideration and judge them accordingly. Surely there must be a large number of the inactive ones, however, who could have some part in bearing the fruits of the kingdom if they really desired to do so.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> Jesus has laid down the rule that only those who bring forth the fruits of the kingdom as they have opportunity can be of the kingdom. This rule is so plainly and emphatically stated that there cannot be any doubt about it. (Matt. 21:43) God’s commandments that specifically apply at the present time are: ‘This gospel of the kingdom must be preached as a witness; ye are my witnesses that I am God; declare the day of the vengeance of our God; proclaim his doings among the people; make mention that his name is exalted. ’ (Matt. 24:14; Isa. 43:10-12; 61:1-6; 12:4) Those who love God will keep his commandments. (John 14:21) If they have not received the love of the truth but are continuing to hold a knowledge of the truth in selfishness or even indifferently, what is the prospect for such ? Do they not put themselves into position to be deceived and led away by the sin of the wicked one? (2 Pet. 3:17) If so, it appears that there may still be a further separating work to be accomplished in order that the approved ones may be made manifest. It is certain that everything that can be shaken will be shaken and that those who hold the truth in selfishness and thus continue to do so will be shaken out in order that those “which cannot be shaken may remain’’.—Heb. 12:27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>29</sup> In Revelation 3:18-20 the Lord gave warning to the lukewarm and indifferent ones, which evidently is done to give such an opportunity to awaken and to avail themselves of joyful service for the Lord. Likewise through his prophet God gave warning and encouragement to those who would awaken themselves to their privileges to cease from their selfishness and delight themselves in the service of the Lord. (Isa. 58: 8-14) They failing to heed such warning, it would seem certain that such would fall into the deceptions practiced by the wicked one and thus become a part of the “man of sin”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">DELUSION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>80</sup> “And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie.” (2 Thess. 2:11) Other translations of this text read, “an energy of delusion.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Diaglott)</span><span class="font4"> “An inworking of error.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font4"> “ A working of error.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(A..R.V.) </span><span class="font4">Says the apostle: “For this cause God shall send them strong delusion.” For what cause? Manifestly because they have not received the love of the truth and are therefore open to the deceptions practiced by the enemy and ready to believe the lie, which is antikingdom. God is not responsible for the organization of error, but by casting Satan out of heaven and by taking away the administration of the holy spirit as a helper and advocate and letting Satan at them he sends them “a working of error” or “energy of delusion” and the great deceiver enters into them. The reason assigned, being “for this cause”, completely exonerates Jehovah from being a party to the deception. Jehovah gave them the truth and they received it but did not receive the love of it and did not show their love for him, and therefore they put themselves in a position to believe the lie and have pleasure in unrighteousness. They not only refuse to be for the kingdom and the witnesses thereof, but openly and violently oppose those who do attempt to do God’s work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>31</sup> Now the great issue is: Jehovah God, the Supreme One; the day of Jehovah and his Christ; the kingdom of heaven is here; and the day of the vengeance of our God must be declared; the truth must be told concerning the enemy and his organization, and a testimony must be given to the supremacy and honor of God and his holy name. It is the time for the vindication of God’s name. The testimony oi this God gave to his beloved One. To the anointed remnant on earth there has been committed a work of delivering this testimony, and those who love God will now keep his commandments and give the testimony regardless of all opposition. (Rev. 12:17) Such is the great work that must now be done and which was foreshadowed by Elisha. Those having the spirit of Elisha now joyfully engage in that work. Such is the work which the Society is now doing by the grace of God. Therefore those who have once received the truth and then oppose or attempt to hinder that work believe Satan's lie and take pleasure in that unrighteousness. That lie is anti-God and anti-kingdom, and all who are not for God and for Christ and the kingdom are against God and the kingdom and Christ.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>32</sup> By means of the lie the “man of sin” gathers with Satan’s forces against God’s kingdom at the battle of Armageddon. (Zech. 14:1,2) Laboring under that energy of delusion those who compose the “man of sin” are led into a course of action which furnishes the basis for God’s judgment upon them as unworthy of life and worthy of perdition, and hence such are designated “the son of perdition”. This judgment must precede the general judgment of mankind. Since judgment begins at the house of God and the “man of sin” assumes to represent God, and thereby seats himself in the temple, he must have judgment fully pronounced upon him. “And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner [the man of sin] appear? And if it [judgment] first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God” but who have pleasure in unrighteousness to oppose the presence and the proclamation of that kingdom? (1 Pet. 4:17,18) Those who have the love of the truth never rejoice in unrighteousness, because ‘love rejoices not in unrighteousness; it rejoices in the truth’.—1 Cor. 13:6.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">STAND FIRM</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>33</sup> The “evil servant” class now oppose the Society and those who go to make up God’s little remnant, and are desperately trying to turn these workers away from the activity of the service of the Lord. The weak and double-minded will be deceived. The faithful will not be deceived. It is certain that only those who have the love of the truth will be in the kingdom, and it is by obedience to God’s commandments that we prove our love. Therefore if for a selfish reason one now is persuaded to forsake the service of the Lord and the giving of the witness for the kingdom it is certain that he could not be received into the kingdom. This would be particularly true if one quit the Lord’s service merely to engage in some worldly or selfish enterprise when he was not compelled to do so to support a dependent one.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>34</sup> Those who are now standing and who will continue to stand will “offer an offering unto the Lord in righteousness” and take delight therein, because that is the very purpose of the Lord’s purging the sons of Levi upon coming to the temple. (Mal. 3:1-3) That means that they will delight to continue together to praise God and sing forth the honor of his name in obedience to his commandments. (Isa. 12:4; 1 Pet. 2:9) They have been instructed in righteousness and have taken their stand on the side of Jehovah and are joyfully obeying him. To such the apostle says: “So then, brethren, stand firm, and retain the instructions you were taught, whether by our word or letter.”—2 Thess. 2:15, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>35</sup> There are today several companies of those who claim to be in the truth but none of which fully agree upon their doctrines nor stand together in harmony. The only thing they do agree upon is their opposition to the Society and the kingdom work. They once received the truth, but, whatever truth they received or have, they do not have the love of the truth, and they have not the works that accompany the love of the truth. They have not the love of the truth which the truth when held in righteousness always develops. Their advice and speech is not only unsound, but deceptive and misleading. Let no one be deceived by them. No one will be deceived who has the love of the truth and who delights to sing forth the praises of Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>36</sup> The remnant may expect to be opposed to the very end, because the enemy will use every instrument within his power to destroy them. (Rev. 12:17) His most effective instrument is the “man of sin”. Remember now the words of Jesus: “But he that shall endure unto the end . . . shall be saved.”— Matt. 24:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>37</sup> The instructions that the Lord’s people have been taught by his Word are sure and complete. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hold fast thereto and stand firm in the Lord; resist the wicked one and he will flee from you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>38</sup> The best way to resist that wicked one is to persistently and joyfully continue actively in the service and sing forth the praises of Jehovah’s name, proclaiming his doings to the people, and thus maintain your integrity with him and keep yourselves in the love of God!</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark7"></a>FRIENDSHIP OF THE WORLD ENMITY WITH GOD</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">[Thirty-minute radio lecture]</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font4">O BE the friend of the great Jehovah God is the greatest privilege accorded to either men or angels. Likewise, the greatest calamity that can befall any intelligent creature is to have Jehovah count him as an enemy. To be the enemy of God one must be either wittingly or unwittingly opposed to his work or to his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are millions of people on earth who do not want to be God’s enemies, yet are unwittingly such because they are associated and cooperating with those who are opposing and trying to hinder God and his work. The great mass of heathen peoples of earth are sinners in God’s sight, but are not wilfully opposing him or his work, for the reason that they know nothing about God and the great work he is doing in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bible indicates that there is one thing, more than all else, that will separate people from the friendship of God and make them his enemies, and that one thing is called “the world”. Over and over again Jesus admonished his followers to separate themselves from the world, to have no fellowship with it, and to come out from it. He told them that, while they were in the world, they were not to be a part of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Christian who hobnobs with the world to any extent is likened to a woman who is an adulteress, for the reason that the thing which- the Bible calls “the world” is a great institution organized by Satan for the purpose of opposing God, his work, and his people. The name “adulteress” most aptly describes those who have vowed to take the Lord as their Head and “bridegroom” and then desert him and unite with Satan as their head and “bridegroom”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord requires faithfulness to their vows on the part of all who desire </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font4"> friendship and love. Hence we find the Bible replete with warnings such as, ‘Ye cannot serve two masters’ and “Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of devils”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Apostle James (chapter 4, verse 4) says: “Know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.” In chapter 1, verse 27, the same apostle admonishes those who desire God’s friendship to ‘keep themselves unspotted from the ■world’. And in 1 John 2:15, the beloved apostle adds: “Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. ’ ’ It follows, therefore, that the matter of greatest importance to the one who loves the Lord and desires to retain his friendship is to know exactly what is meant by the oft-repeated phrase “the world”, “this world,” or “this present evil world”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Among Christian people there are two ways of interpreting the phrase “the world”. Some think that these words refer to the earth, and when they read texts that speak of the “end of the world” they instinctively think of the destruction of the earth. This is manifestly wrong, for if the word “world” means “earth”, then “the friendship of the world” would mean “the friendship of the earth”, and “the wisdom of this world” would mean “the wisdom of the earth”, all of which is nonsense. Besides, the Bible tells us that “the earth abideth for ever”.—Eccl. 1: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Other Christian people interpret the words “the world” as having reference to the wicked, immoral and vicious people of earth. This is especially the view of clergymen, evangelists and missionaries, and when they read Jesus’ words urging his people to ‘come out from the world’, and the words of the apostles which enjoin them to “love not the world” and to ‘keep yourself unspotted from the world’, they assume that they merely mean to hold aloof from or to separate themselves from the vicious class of people, which includes murderers, thieves, liars, adulterers and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That this view is incorrect is amply proven by the fact that Jesus himself was the friend of publicans, sinners and harlots. Indeed, this was the very charge that the ultra-moral Pharisees brought against Jesus. (Matt. 11:19; Luke 7:39) They called him a “winebibber” because he drank a little wine when he chose to do so. They called him the friend of publicans, sinners and harlots, because his great magnanimous heart went out in sympathy to the outcast elements of society, and he preached to them of a coming kingdom, which message filled their hearts with hope and joy. Jesus realized that the hypocritical system which was fostered by those Pharisees had made them outcasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Pharisees, who were the religious leaders of that day, boasted of their morality, their superiority to and their aloofness from the ‘ ‘ common herd ’ ’. They refused to enter the Roman judgment hall lest they should be defiled. (John 18:28) With stinging sarcasm Jesus reproved them for their claim to superiority on the basis of being more moral than others, saying, “The publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. ’ ’—Matt. 21: 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus it is evident that the words “the world” do not refer to the outcasts of society, and when Jesus said, ‘ Come out of the world, ’ he did not mean to separate oneself from these, nor to ostracize them, as is the custom of Christian people today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Other texts also show unmistakably that the words “the world” have no reference to the vicious classes just mentioned. For instance, the Bible mentions “the kingdoms of this world”, and ‘a sin that hath no</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">forgiveness, either in this world, or in the world to eome’; it also mentions “the foundation of the world”. Surely none of these texts refer to the criminally inclined. The words “the world”, therefore, must contain a far deeper significance than that ordinarily given to them, and every honest person who loves the Lord and desires to be his friend should be interested in knowing just what the phrase means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What, then, is meant by “the world”? and how does a “love” of the world and a “friendship” with the world make one the enemy of God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To get a proper understanding of the word “world” it is helpful to remember that the Bible calls attention to three worlds, all of which are right here on the earth. These three worlds cover three different periods of time. The first world covers the period from the time Adam sinned until the flood in Noah’s day, approximately 1,654 years. Peter mentions this world and its destruction, in 2 Peter 3: 6, as follows: “Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished. ’ ’ In verse 5 he tells us that the world before the flood was made up of a “heavens” and an “earth”, which means that there were two parts to that world, namely, a heavenly or invisible part and an earthly or visible part. Anyone can readily see that the earth itself did not perish; hence the word “world” cannot mean the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All lexicons define the word “world” to mean “arrangement”. Thus we can see that before the flood there was existing an </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">arrangement,</span><span class="font4"> or, better still, an </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“organization”,</span><span class="font4"> having two parts, namely, an invisible part called “heavens”, and a visible part called “earth”. The Bible further reveals that God destroyed this organization of two parts because it was wicked and corrupt and because it opposed the work of Jehovah God and spread unrighteousness and sin abroad in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The great master mind who built up this organization was Satan, and his one and only purpose was to oppose God and righteousness. He succeeded so well that of conditions in the earth at the time of the flood we read as follows: “The sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them.” This simply means that Satan led some of the angels of heaven, here called “the sons of God”, to leave their heavenly abode and materialize by taking human bodies, and then to choose out for themselves the fairest ones of the daughters of men to be their wives. This intermarriage of angels and humans was sin in God’s sight. The offspring of this union of angels and humans were giants who were wicked and cruel and domineered over men and led the whole race into sin and vice, and on this account God destroyed that world and bound those wicked angels until the judgment day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The apostle mentions this destruction and binding, in 2 Peter 2:4,5, as follows: ‘ ‘ God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment, and spared not the old world, but saved Noah, the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">world of the ungodly.”</span><span class="font4"> Ah yes, the world before the flood was not the earth, but </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“the world of the ungodly”.</span><span class="font4"> In other words, it was a wicked, corrupt organization of Satan, made up of both angels and men for the avowed purpose of bringing into the earth an unrighteous condition, contrary to the divine arrangement. Doubtless it took Satan many centuries to perfect this organization, and it was at the time when Satan thought he had it perfected that God interfered and destroyed it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Genesis 6:5-9 Jehovah has given us a brief but very explicit description of conditions existing before the flood. It reads: “And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. Noah was a just man, and perfect in his generations.” This means that Noah and his family were the only ones on earth that had not intermarried with the angelic stock. Noah was perfect in his genealogy, that is, he was pure Adamic stock. Therefore God destroyed Satan’s organization and all who were affiliated with it, and saved Noah and his family, and through these started the race again after the flood. Thus we are assured that all the peoples of earth are descendants of Adam through Noah. The hybrid race produced by the angels was everlastingly destroyed in the flood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With these facts in mind, it is possible to understand what is meant by the word “world”. It means an organization of both angels and men under the control and leadership of Satan. The invisible part, consisting of Satan and angels, is called “heavens”; and the visible part, consisting of men organized together into political, financial and religious bodies, is called “earth”. This heavenly and earthly organization of Satan was organized for the one and only purpose of circulating and popularizing false and slanderous teachings about God and his Word of truth, to spread unrighteousness, corruption, vice, lawlessness, oppression, cruelty, graft, dishonesty and hypocrisy in the earth, and to persecute the people of God who arc in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After God destroyed the first organization of Satan in the flood, Satan immediately began to form another organization of angels and men for the very same purpose, namely, to foster sin and unrighteousness in the earth and to slander and misrepresent God. It took him many centuries to perfect this organization, and, according to the Bible, he had perfected it about the year 1914, and there God began to destroy this second organization of Satan, called, in the Bible, “this present evil world.” This second devilish “world” covers the period of time from the flood until the second advent of the Lord, until Jesus took his power and began his reign and began ouster proceedings against Satan. Jesus and the apostles lived about midway between the beginning and the end of this period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let us now note some of the texts which refer to this second satanic world. Jesus said: “The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.” (John 14:30) Again, he said: “The prince of this world is judged.” (John 16:11) Paul said: “The God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not.” (2 Cor. 4:4) John says: ‘The whole world lieth in the wicked one.’ (1 John 5:19) Again, John says: “The world passeth away.” (1 John 2:17) In Galatians 1:4 Paul calls it “this present evil world”. Thus with united voice Paul, Peter and Jesus tell us that Satan is the ruler, the god, the leader and controller of this second evil world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This second organization of Satan has both a visible and an invisible part. The invisible part consists of ‘Satan and his angels’, mentioned by Jesus, in Matthew 25: 41, and by John, in Revelation 12:7-9. These wicked angels under the leadership of Satan, while not permitted to materialize, are permitted to obsess men and women who will </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">yield their wills to</span><span class="font4"> their control. Jesus found many people possessed of devils, or demons, in the earth in his day. These are referred to as ‘lying spirits’, ‘wicked spirits,’ “seducing spirits,” and “devils”. Under Satan’s leadership and control these wicked, lying spirits are in our day maneuvering under the names of spiritism, mesmerism, hypnotism and kindred cults, for the purpose of deceiving the people about death and the resurrection, both of which are so prominently mentioned in the Bible. They try to palm themselves off as the spirits of dead humans, and thus to perpetuate the lie uttered by Satan in Eden, when he said to mother Eve: ‘ God doth know that ye </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">shall not</span><span class="font4"> surely die.’ Their purpose is to make people believe that death </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">is not death, </span><span class="font4">but really a gateway into a higher and better life. Should they succeed in making the people believe this, then they will succeed in proving God a liar and the Bible untrue; because God said to Adam, “Thou shalt surely die,” and the Bible says, “The dead know not anything.” (Eccl. 9:5) This is just what Satan desires to do, and it is for this purpose that he has organized the wicked angels; namely, that he may, through them, deceive mankind by misrepresenting God and the Bible. They constitute the “heavens” of this second evil world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But Satan has a visible part to the second world, called “earth”. The earth, or the visible part, is made up of organizations of men, who, under the control of Satan, are trying to fill the earth with unrighteousness, graft, deception, fraud, hypocrisy, oppression, tyranny, and trying to slander God by teaching falsehoods about him. Get the point now. Satan is working through </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">organizations of</span><span class="font4"> men, and not so much through individuals. The very word “world” means “organization” or “arrangement”. We get this thought also in the words used by Satan when he tempted Jesus. See Matthew 4:8,9, which reads: “Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kingdoms of the world.”</span><span class="font4"> This certainly refers to political kingdoms, and not to individuals. Then Satan said: “All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus we can see that all the political organizations of men are of Satan. And it is through these that wars are fomented; that graft, corruption, bribery and oppression fill the earth. It is the great financial organizations that force poverty and dire distress with high rents, high taxes and high cost of living on the people. It is through the great religious organizations that the doctrines of “eternal torment”, “trinity” and ‘the divine right of kings and clergy’ are foisted on the people. Thus God is misrepresented and slandered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God has decreed that this great organization called “the world” shall come to an end, and many times do the Scriptures speak of the “end of the world”, which does not refer to the end of the earth, but to the end of the wicked, unrighteous, oppressive organization of Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since Satan organized the “world” in order to oppose God, and since he is the avowed enemy of God, then it follows that all who in any degree aid Satan or his organization, or even have sympathy with these, are the enemies of God, because they are lined up with the great enemy who is opposing, misrepresenting and slandering God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those who wish to be on the Lord’s side should </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘come out of the world'.</span><span class="font4"> Their future eternal life depends upon their taking their stand for the Lord, for his truth and for righteousness, for it is written: “Ye cannot serve God and mammon”; ‘Ye cannot eat at the table of the Lord and of the table of devils. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The apostle says: “The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.” (1 Cor. 3:19) This means that the wisest schemes and plans of men are foolish because they do not take God into consideration. It means that no plan or scheme of man can possibly bring any blessings to the race. Speaking to those who desire to please God, the apostle advises to “keep himself unspotted from the world”. What does this mean? It means that if one who is a Christian takes any part in the graft, oppression and unrighteousness of the world (the Devil’s organization) he defiles himself and unfits himself for the Master’s use. He takes his stand against God and for the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now we are prepared to understand what the apostle meant when he said, ‘ ‘ The friendship of the world is enmity with God”; and when he said, “Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the father is not in him. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We feel sure that all good men will be glad when Satan’s wicked government will be destroyed; when sin and unrighteousness, poverty and oppression, graft, corruption and bribery, as well as all slanders against God and misrepresentations of his truth, will come to an end. Thank God the “end of the world” has come. Christ has already taken his power and has begun ouster proceedings against Satan. The work will soon be completed, and Satan will be bound for a thousand years in order that he may deceive the nations no more till the thousand years are ended. (Rev. 20:2,3) The people are soon to be completely delivered from the power of Satan and his wicked government, consisting of wicked angels and wicked men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is because Satan’s second “world” is to be destroyed that the Scriptures tell us of another “world to come” and that it is a righteous world and that Christ shall be the Ruler and Leader of the people, while Satan will be bound. This “world to come” consists of a “heavens” and an “earth”. This means that it will be represented by Christ and the holy angels in heaven, who will be invisible to men, and by holy men on earth, who will be visible to mankind. The visible representatives will be those holy men mentioned in the book of Hebrews, chapter 11, and who will be “made princes in all the earth”. (Ps. 45:16) Their names include Abel, Enoch, Moses, Abraham, Isaac and all the prophets, and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After reciting in vivid language the destruction of the evil “heavens and earth”, which Satan organized, the apostle exclaims in triumphant tones: “Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” —2 Pct. 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every good man will rejoice in the knowledge of the kingdom of God. As one reads of the corruption in the political, financial and even the religious world, in the columns of the daily press, one becomes heartsick and longs for a righteous kingdom and its blessings. The repeated failures of Satan’s wicked, corrupt government in its efforts to establish peace, righteousness and justice in the earth, and to end profiteering, oppression, wars and lawlessness, is indisputable proof that we can expect no relief from this quarter, and that the only hope is in the kingdom of God, the “world to come, wherein dwelleth righteousness”. All honest men acknowledge the failure of human efforts, but the majority know not which way to turn nor what to do. Like drowning men they are grasping at the straws held out to them by the proposed League of Nations, the World Court, disarmament conferences, prohibition and other </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“vain imaginations” of</span><span class="font4"> men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The people have not yet learned that their only hope of blessings is in “the world to come”. This world to come is the kingdom of God, for which Jesus taught us to pray, saying: ‘When thou prayest say, Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That kingdom is now being set up in the earth. “The world to come” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">is noiv</span><span class="font4"> here. The deliverance of the people from the power of Satan’s organization, called “this present evil world”, will soon be an accomplished fact. The Lord is taking control of earth’s affairs just when the need is greatest and when the outlook is most gloomy. Millions of books and booklets announcing the fact that a new world is at hand are being placed in the hands of the people at cost price, and the same message is being broadcast over many radio stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is now especially true that a Christian, who is aware of these facts, should not love the world or have friendship with it, for by so doing he takes his stand against the Lord and in favor of perpetuating the government of Satan, which is doomed to everlasting destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">in tiiat day </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">shall this song he sung in the land of Judah: We have a strong city;</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark9"></a>MILLIONS OF PRISONERS TO HEAR THE GOSPEL</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">[Fifteen-minute radio lecture!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font4">HE words “prison” and “prisoners” are found many times in the Bible. In many instances “prison” refers to the literal prison, with bars, doors and walls. In several texts the word “prisoners” does not refer to literal prisoners, but to a class of people who are in bondage, under a restraint; that is, they are deprived of their liberty to think and act as they would like to do, and to do those things which their conscience tells them is right. Their condition of bondage, restraint and deprivation of just rights and liberties is imposed upon them by that wicked creature called “the Devil, and Satan”, who uses men as his instruments in this wicked work. Such people are called “prisoner’s” because they are in bondage to tradition, superstition, fear of man, and fear of loss of good name and business. Many of these people are creed-bound and fear lest they be called “unorthodox”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Proverbs 29: 25, we read: ‘ ‘ The fear of man bringeth a snare.” The word “snare” means “to put a noose around the neck”. The picture is that of a master leading a slave, his prisoner. Millions of people are afraid of public opinion, public criticism or public censure. Such people are captives, prisoners. Ofttimes such a prison experience is much more galling than to be in a literal prison. It is pitiful to see people afraid to use that liberty of opinion and expression which is the God-given right of every man and woman on earth. Anyone who holds such an unwarranted control of another’s rights and liberties is a wicked person, and interfering with the divine arrangement; he is the enemy of God and man, of truth and righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">True Christians are called God’s prisoners, and Jesus </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">invites</span><span class="font4"> them to take his yoke upon themselves, and promises them his watchcare, protection and love and that all things shall work together for their good. He says to them, “My yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” Satan’s prisoners are taken captive by him against their will; their captivity is not for their blessing, but for their injury; it is a tyrannical bondage. They have his noose about their neck, and are held in bondage by slavish fear or dread of offending some man or woman, or breaking some established law or custom, or being out of style or saying something contrary to some established creed. This is a devilish bondage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The time is soon to come when everybody will be delivered from such bondage, and it will be the gospel of Jesus Christ that will set them free. In other words, it will be the truth that will free these prisoner’s. Speaking to true Christians, the apostle says: ‘In meekness instruct those who oppose themselves, that they may recover themselves from the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.’ (2 Tim. 2: 26) In Psalm 91: 3, we are told that true Christians shall be delivered from the snare of the fowler. The fowler here mentioned is Satan. Again, in Psalm 140:1-5, we read: ‘ ‘ Deliver me, 0 Lord, from the evil man; preserve me from the violent man; which imagine mischiefs in their heart: . . . they have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders’ poison is under their lips. . . . The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords: they have spread a net by the way side: they have set gins for me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God has an organization on earth, made up of men and women who love the Lord and are trying to serve him. Satan has an organization on earth, made up of men and women who profess to serve the Lord but who are really serving the Devil. Satan’s organization </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">claims</span><span class="font4"> to be God’s organization, and persecutes those who are actually members of God’s organization. Satan’s organization sails under the high-sounding name of “Christendom”. It boasts of a membership of over 500,000,000 persons. Its members are in bondage to creeds, customs, rites and ceremonies; they dare not disown these or criticize or expose them. To do so would bring down on their heads taunts, reproaches, disfellowship and persecution. Many thousands of the Lord’s people are held in these denominations as prisoners, afraid to express their disapproval of the creeds, methods and customs of the organization. These are very unhappy; they love the Lord, and would desire to see his name honored, and his truth preached without the use of formalism, ceremonies, creedal bondage and the collection box, yet they dare not take their stand; so they remain in the prisons, against their sense of justice and right. They have Satan’s noose about their neck; they are his prisoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This great prison house, called “Christendom” by men, and called “Babylon” (which means confusion) by God, is mentioned in Revelation 18:4, and the Lord says: “Come out of her, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">my people.”</span><span class="font4"> God purposes to destroy great Babylon, and all of the Lord’s people who remain therein will share her plagues. Many thousands of the Lord’s people have heard the voice of the Lord and come out. These do not fear the anathemas of men or devils; they do not fear to lose their good name or reputation; they are not afraid of sneers, reproaches or persecutions. They come out into the glorious liberty of the sons of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those who remain in Babylon because of fear or doubt are the prisoners; they are conscious of their false position as well as the shams and lies of Babylon, but lack the courage of their convictions. They sigh and cry and mourn for all the abominations which they see in Christendom, yet dare not shake off the yoke of the Devil and take the yoke of the Lord. There are more of this kind of prisoners in Babylon than of all the prisoners held in real jails and peni-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">tentiaries throughout all the earth. God loves these prisoners; he pities them; he sees their honest desire to serve him; he understands their fears, and has purposed to deliver them from their prison, but first he will punish them for their lack of faith and courage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Revelation 7:9-15 we are shown a great multitude, whom no man can number, who must come through great tribulation and wash their robes and make them white in the blood of the Lamb. These are the prisoners. They made a covenant with the Lord by sacrifice, which means that they must die, as must all of those who win a place in heaven. Hence it is proper to say that they were “appointed to die&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Psalm 79:11 we read of these prisoners as follows: “Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die.&quot; Also, in Psalm 102:19-21, we read: ‘' For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the Lord behold the earth; to hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God purposes to destroy Satan’s organization and to bind Satan for a thousand years. That is how he will deliver the prisoners; and what a deliverance it will be! Free from the power and dominion of Satan; free from fear of men; free from the domineering influence, jeers, taunts and persecutions of professing Christians; free to serve the living God with reverence and godly fear. This freedom is called “the glorious liberty of the sons of God&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After having joined Satan’s organization, the people are told that it is dishonorable and disgraceful to separate from it; that to do so means disloyalty to God. They are threatened with reproach, social ostracism and persecution in this life, and eternal torment in the life to come. Every one of these claims is false, yet there are thousands of people who fear the anathemas and reproaches of the “best people in the community&quot;, and remain in bondage, while their own consciences and sense of justice and right are continually outraged. These will remain prisoners until God liberates them by destroying the prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But what a punishment they will have while they remain therein! Their conscience will be troubling them all the time; they will fear to lose their good name and standing if they come out, and fear the Lord’s disapproval if they stay in. Their life will be one of continual anxiety and torment. Upon the true followers of the Lord rests the responsibility of telling these prisoners that the Lord is soon to destroy the prison and fully deliver them. They cannot be loyal to the Lord and neglect to give this message. In Isaiah 61:1,2, we read: “The spirit of Jehovah is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach ... the opening of the prison to them that are bound . . . , and the day of vengeance of our God.” If professed Christians fail to deliver this message they will lose their place in the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Preaching to those in prison the good news of the destruction of Satan’s organization and of the deliverance of the prisoners will inspire the more courageous to take their stand for the Lord and come out of the prison; and it will plant a hope in the hearts of the less courageous ones and prepare them to take their stand for the Lord at some future and now not far distant time. Their tribulation will continue, however, until they cry unto the Lord for deliverance. Psalm 142:3-7 foretells this cry for help: “When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path; in the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me. ... I cried unto thee, 0 Lord: . . . Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I. Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those who are thus warning these prisoners of their danger are called the Lord’s “watchmen”. In Ezekiel 33: 6 we read: “ If the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman’s hand.” This means that if the Lord’s true saints fail to tell the prisoners of their danger and of the destruction of the Devil’s organization, they will be held responsible and punished for their failure to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Therefore we warn those who profess to be Christians that they should take their stand against those institutions of earth that are full of shams, hypocrisies and lies, and those institutions which teach the false doctrines of eternal torment, trinity, human immortality, and evolution, and take their stand unequivocally on the Lord’s side, because the hour is come when these institutions are to be destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If any of the Lord’s people lack the courage to thus take a stand for the Lord, they are laying up in store for themselves a terrible tribulation, in the near future, which will punish them for their lack of faith and confidence in the Lord and for their love of man and the esteem of their fellow men. Such as have not the courage to take this stand are of the prisoners, in captivity in earth’s greatest prison house. Their wisest course is to take their stand for the Lord and “come out of her”. If they do this they will have the Lord’s blessing and approval now, and a glorious place in his future kingdom, and a share in the work of that kingdom.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark11"></a>LETTERS</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">GRATITUDE TO JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">My dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The first thing I must mention is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light.</span><span class="font3"> I have now had my copy of Book One for a week. Two days ago I felt the desire to tell you of my pleasure and joy. I concluded to send you a cable, which I did. After reading it during the week-end I could find no better illustration of my feelings than Daniel's record of his after he had received his revelation: wonder and astonishment and gratitude to Jehovah, the Giver of all good, crowded on me. I felt I could do no other than congratulate you on being the ready instrument for our great God and the Lord in tins thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font3"> is of course, and of necessity, the greatest of all evidences that Jehovah is doing his foretold work through the Society, and that therefore it is his instrument at this time. One can see now why the Lord let us go on in the way and then showed us that we had been doing a work already pictured in his purpose. Also this revelation has made it appear that some such thing was certain, so as to give to his faithful servants just that which would cause them to serve to the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Book Two came this morning, and I have not had time to do more than dip into it After the assurance of Book One there was naturally confidence that Book Two would continue the same conclusive evidence. It does, and despite all that we know of the goodness of God, still wonder and astonishment are present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The marshalling of the facts is great; one is led on with a swing, and the presentation of things familiar now fitted into their proper place makes the heart rejoice. The Lord has indeed blessed you in your desire to honor and magnify his name. And he will continue to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With much love, I am your brother and your servant in the Lord,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">J. Hemery, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">London. </span><span class="font3">support you as you seek to glorify Jehovah God and to carry forward to completion the work that he has given to you and to his people to do here in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Praying always the Lord’s blessing and guidance upon and for you and all his people, we are, Your brethren in Christ, Glenn G. Smith Carrie, a. Anderson Miriam S. Smith &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlotte C. Scott</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PLENTY OF CHANCES TO PROCLAIM GOD’S WORD</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Not unmindful of the fact of your being a very busy instrument in God’s hand, yet we feel it our duty to say a few words of encouragement for the wonderful work you are doing for the human race. Your lectures on Job have been a wonderful feast and have brought out the Word so plainly that a child could understand. While we are not permitted to hear you over the radio, we look forward to the good old </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> for a real feast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We can not all be lecturers, but we may all be able to pass the good work along to others, and that is what we do. In our business we have plenty of chances for missionary work, and proclaim God’s Word no matter in what station in life we may be. The truth in your sermons is what appeals to the Christian people, and the greatest desire of my heart is that you may live until you are able to see greater results of your labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We trust you will receive this in the same spirit in which it is written, and hope to live to see the time when your sermons will reach and be enjoyed by millions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Very kindly yours,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">C. W. Peters, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Idaho.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">STRENGTH, COMFORT, ENCOURAGEMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I have finished reading the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font3"> books. I feel that'the message they contain is the most wonderful and thrilling that has ever come to mortal man! These books, together with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy,</span><span class="font3"> are a source of strength, comfort, and encouragement to me, and I am sure they will greatly strengthen the Lord’s people and increase their </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">joy.</span><span class="font3"> I appreciate very much your labor of love in behalf of Jehovah, our present King, and his people. I am glad that I am privileged to see &quot;eye to eye’’ with the Lord’s people at this time when he is &quot;building up Zion”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As a result of the light that is now shining upon the temple class, no doubt the Lord's people will be closely knit together and will speedily accomplish the work that Jehovah has for them to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I gratefully acknowledge the joy and blessedness which has come from the Lord through you and the dear brethren at headquarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yours in the service of our glorious King,</span></p>
