<h5><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Serumization</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">HERE are 1200 different kinds of germs -L recognized by the medical profession, but thus far only eighty-nine serums or vaccines have been manufactured and licensed for sale by the Federal Health Service, and some are raising the question whether until the other 1,111 serums are prepared and made available the state should hurry us all into serumization willy-nilly. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In addition to the 1200 different germs, 800 of which are classified as bacilli (rod-shaped bugs), 300 of which are classified as cocci (round-shaped bugs), and approximately 100 as spirilla (screw-shaped bugs), there are the myriads of other bugs too small to be seen through any microscope yet invented. Nevertheless, says Dr. Park L. Myers, of Toledo, Ohio, “With all the -wonderful strides of our science in 100 years, we still have the public as abjectly cowed today before the omnipotent hosts of bacteria as it was by the evil spirits and ghosts and witches of the past century.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Among those who are waiting, none .too patiently, for the medical profession to attempt to prepare and place upon the market and have pumped into the veins of children and adults the other 1,111 kinds of serum prepared from bugs from which no preparation has yet been marketed are John L. Spivak (author of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Medical Trust Unmashed,</span><span class="font7"> 170 pages, clothbound, published by Louis S. Siegfried, 13 Astor Place, New York city, price $1.00), and H. B. Anderson (author of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">State Medicine a Menace to Democracy,</span><span class="font7"> 115 pages, clothbound, published by the Citizens Medical Reference Bureau, 1860 Broadway, New York city, price $1.00). The facts in this article are taken from these turnbooks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One objection that seems to hold back Messrs. Spivak and Anderson from clamoring for wholesale serumization by the state for the whole list of 1200 varieties off bugs if, as and when dis-</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark10"></a>by the State</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">covered, or even the wholesale serumization by the state for the eighty-nine kinds of bugs that have been more or less discovered,, is their joint and collective inability to see where the time is coming from to provide us with opportunity to recover from all these inoculations, which hypothetically and ptitativeljr we so sorely need. It takes about two weeks to fairly regain one’s health from one of these inoculations or serum-izations. Some of them are not claimed to give immunity at all, and the length of time in which immunity is even hoped for is sometimes set at as little as six weeks. But as there are only fifty-two weeks in the year, a wholesale serumization with even a portion of the eighty-nine kinds of serum now on the market would make us all sick for fifty-two weeks out of the year without waiting f dr the other 1,111 varieties, and in effect, as six weeks is the period of immunity for some of these serums, we could not expect even then to be well stocked up with more than three kinds of bugs at once, and thus would at all times be liable to catch any one of the 1,197 other kinds of disease, the bugs of which we did not happen to have available in our systems at the time. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">-4&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Progress of Medical Science</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is very evident that medical science has traveled some since the fatal illness to Gen. George Washington. Medical science has styles, like the styles in women’s clothing. The style in Washington’s day was bloodletting, and when the general got sick they first took from his arm fourteen ounces of blood; and finding that that did not make him feel any better they concluded to do the job right and took thirty-two ounces more. The general forthwith passed out of this life, hut it was a great mystery to the medical profession why he should have done such a thing when medical science did everything for him and to him that it- knew how to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another medical style, brought from Constantinople, was the insertion of the running matter from the sore of a smallpox patient into the blood of a healthy person. Prior to 1840 the Royal College of Physicians highly endorsed such inoculation, but the result was to spread smallpox so rapidly that in the latter year an act of Parliament condemned this form of inoculation as a criminal offense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Current Style of Vaccination</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is on record much expression of opinion by many eminent physicians that vaccination is a fad and will pass out of existence as many other medical styles have done. Japan enthusiastically vaccinated almost everybody, yet in 1907 had an outbreak of 19,101 eases of smallpox, with 6,273 deaths. Most of those who died had been vaccinated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Vaccination for smallpox, typhoid, influenza, etc., is very popular among the surgeons in charge of the United States army and navy. As illustrations of this popularity we have the fact that the number of admissions to hospital in the army in 1918 on account of typhoid vaccinations was 23,191, and the number on account of vaccinia was 10,830. In 1917 there was a total of 19,608 admissions to the hospital on account of typhoid vaccination and vaccinia, thus making a total of 53,629 soldiers made sick in two years directly due to typhoid and smallpox vaccination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Despite this great enthusiasm for vaccination, the death rate in tire military camps was higher than among the civil population even in similar age groups. This was so true that in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of the American Medical Association</span><span class="font7"> for December 7, 1918, Dr. Victor G. Heiser said, “It is apparent that it is more dangerous to be a soldier in peaceful U. S. than to have been on the firing line in France.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The same situation prevails in the navy, where the death rate in the naval forces ashore in the United States in 1918 for influenza and pneumonia was 18.77 per thousand, while that of the population generally in the United States in 1918 for the same diseases was 5.83 per thousand, and 18 per thousand for all diseases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Difficulty of Diagnosis &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Before one could take steps to protect himself from any one of the 1200 germ diseases it would be necessary for him to have some expert identify the disease for him so that he would know which bug to call, and here he would find great difficulty. The learned Dr. Cabot, assistant professor of medicine in Harvard University, prepared a table made up from a study of 3,000 autopsies. This table shows that the autopsies were correct in 53.5 percent of the cases and incorrect in 46.5 percent of the cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A similar table was prepared by Dr. Horst Oertel, formerly chief pathologist of the Bussell Sage Pathological Institute, in 388 cases in which post-mortems 'wore held. The net result was that the diagnoses were confirmed in 52.3 percent of the cases, and not confirmed in 47.7 percent of the cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A much worse situation was revealed during the war among the French and German physicians. During the first year of the war, the French physicians discharged 86,000 soldiers on account of tuberculosis, less than 20 percent of whom were found later to have the disease, while a similar situation involving the same disease and the same figures occurred among the soldiers in the German lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Too Many Hungry Serum Firms</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It would not be so bad to have the thirty-one establishments holding licenses for the manufacture and sale of viruses and serums, nor would it be so bad that these thirty-one concern s have eighty-nine different licensed products, if it -were not for the fact that there seems to be considerable profit in the virus and serum business in which profit these makers seem unduly eager to participate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is not denied that microbes are always to be found where there is disease,, nor can it be denied that they are also found where there is no disease. Concerning these little creatures which, in Germany are called “germs”, in Paris are called “parasites”, and in Ireland are called “microbes” (“Mike Robies”), Dr. Rudolph Virchow, the world’s leading authority on the subject says that they “may be the result and not the cause of disease”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It seems that some of these great vaccine and virus concerns (pharmaceutical companies) seem not to have caught this idea of Dr. Virchow, but are over-enthusiastic in spreading health to all mankind by the bug route provided they may furnish the bugs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That was a wonderful bit of advertising they did, rushing the toxin-antitoxin across the frozen wastes of Alaska to the stricken city of Nome. That was a beautiful statue erected to Balto, the dog that made the famous dash; but the enthusiasm of the public has cooled since it became known that there were only five deaths from diphtheria in Nome, that even those five did not have diphtheria, and that Balto did not even make the dash. Even </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> fell for that Balto bunk, and it now appears that even if Balto had made the dash with the toxin-antitoxin which was to have cured the sick city of Nome, if the city had been sick, yet the toxin-antitoxin would have been harmed by freezing, because in Massachusetts, not nearly so cold as Alaska, the use of frozen diphtheria toxin-antitoxin caused several deaths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Popularity of Serums</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The popularity of serums is brought about by the well known game of advertising, the science of salesmanship. A pharmaceutical concern, for instance, on the work of one investigator prepared and marketed pollen preparations and other similar concoctions. In a short time other' pharmaceutical concerns took advantage of the advertising and put out substitutes for these. Believers in and practicers of serum therapy did the rest. A certain proportion of the patients recovered in spite of these nostrums, but the nostrums were credited with their recovery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the great pharmaceutical companies advertises that 2400 physicians in the United States are cooperating with it daily in testing out new products. Just how many lives have been sacrificed by such human experimentation will never be known before the resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The serums do not always contain the exact kind of bugs named on the label, and some patients are much more sensitive to the insertion of poisons in their blood. According to Dr. Wilfred II. Kellogg, director of the Bureau of Communicable Diseases of the California State Board of Health, in the October, 1925, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">American Journal of Public Health,</span><span class="font7"> “The percentage of error in reading reactions in those who are protein sensitive is, in the hands of even the most experienced, frequently as high as 50 percent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The handling of serums is accompanied with great uncertainty. Thus two great epidemics of foot and mouth disease in the United States in 1902 and 1908 are alleged to have been caused by the vaccine virus of two vaccine manufacturers, which epidemics resulted in great mortality to animals and to man, with a loss of millions of dollars to the government and to the people and for which no recompense has ever been made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When, some years ago, Philadelphia was in the midst of an epidemic of diphtheria and there were many fatalities, a firm of vaccine manufacturers stated that the antitoxin was not being properly administered and that they would take entire charge of the situation and furnish the antitoxin free of expense, provided they could use the statistics which they would thus obtain. Although their proposition was promptly accepted they never published the statistics. The reason for their failure to do so is believed to be that those statistics were against them, and advertising men do not make a practice of publishing statistics which prove their products are worthless or injurious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another difficulty in the “bug” business is that bugs are sometimes found and widely advertised which can never be found thereafter. Thus, the general paresis germ discovered in Scotland years ago has become extinct, “in connection with crotaline, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Bacterium cincinnaticum, </span><span class="font7">which caused so many epileptics to have their colons reduced to semicolons by operations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In the Experimental Stage</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Fourteen different mixtures of toxin-antitoxin and toxoids have been tried out upon the school children of New York city, and there is naturally some question as to which of these fourteen mixtures to use, or whether to mix them all together into one variety or to cast lots as to which is the best mixture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Vaccines have been recommended for vertigo, hay fever, rheumatism, sciatica, appendicitis and gallstones. Immediate attention should be devoted to getting out serums against doughnuts, mince pie, fried ham, welsh rarebits, and other similar enemies to human health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Regarding typhoid fever, in the Charlotte </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Medical Journal</span><span class="font7"> Dr. Joseph A. White says that “vaccination against typhoid fever is being experimented with and has been partially successful”. They used to have lots of typhoid fever in Chicago. Some sanitary engineers, not fully versed in the serum route to health, thought the opening of the Chicago drainage canal might cut the Chicago typhoid rate in half, but they actually cut off more than ninety percent of it. Had it been foreseen how the drainage canal would cut into the business of making typhoid fever vaccines, or the business of administering at a profit, one may question whether the drainage canal would ever have . been built.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Suppose, for instance, that the state board of health of Illinois should have happened to be entirely composed of those who believe it essential to the public welfare that there should be vaccination against typhoid fever, while here would be a canal which would make such vaccination unnecessary. Would they not have been likely to use all their influence against such a canal ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We do not like to say anything about the injection of tuberculin into the eyes of orphans, nor the giving of a full man’s dose of toxin-antitoxin to 2,000 infants only three days old, but we do think it is all right for us to mention that in 1925 the League of Nations stated that “the ideal antidiphtheria, vaccine has yet to be discovered”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not only does toxin-antitoxin deteriorate rapidly and often show disappointing results, but it has caused many deaths, mentioned at various times in our columns. Physicians tell us that the toxin contained in toxin-antitoxin is so poisonous that one ounce of it will kill 75,000 large dogs. The tests made of toxin-antitoxin when ready to apply to infants and children are as to the time which it takes for one dose or ten doses to kill a guinea pig.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We understand that in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of the '' American Medical Association</span><span class="font7"> for November 7, 1925, there was published a statement that certain remedies were unacceptable as new and non-official remedies on account of their indefinite composition. These remedies, put up by E. B. Squibb &amp;&nbsp;Sons, were said to be “Horse Dung Allergen-Squibb, House Dust Allergen-Squibb, Le Page’s Glue Allergen-Squibb and Street Dust Allergen-Squibb”. We have to confess that we do not seem to see anything so indefinite about this composition, though perhaps the word that should have been used is “'decomposition” instead of “composition”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The People Who Disagree</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Perhaps not fully appreciating their privileges of having 1200 kinds of bug extract put into their veins to cure as many kinds of diseases which they may or may not get, there are estimated to be in the United States some 35,-000,000 persons who exercise the mulish propensity of doing with and to their own bodies about as they see fit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For example, there is that ungrateful state of North Dakota which, in the early part of 1919, passed an act providing that “no form of vaccination or inoculation shall hereafter be made a condition precedent in this state for the admission to any public or private school or college, of any person, or for the exercise of any right, the performance of any duty, or the enjoyment of any privilege, by any person”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then there is also that ungrateful state of Utah, which since 1907 has had a law providing that “hereafter it shall be unlawful for any board of health, board of education, or any other public board, acting in this state under police regulations or otherwise, to compel by resolution, order, or proceedings of any kind, the vaccination of any child, or person of any age; or making vaccination a condition precedent to the attendance at any public or private school in the state of Utah, either as pupil or teacher”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Seeming to sense that there might conceivably be some lurking Patrick Henry germs yet lingering in the blood of some of the men whose ancestors tamed a wilderness and reared a great civilization before we had any such thing as a pharmaceutical company, Dr. Victor C. Vaughn said, either with bland irony or else a child-like belief that all the descendants of the pioneers have become morons, “The exercise of medical functions, whether the regulation of medical practice or preventive medicine, is under state control, and I think it is rather fortunate that this is the case, because, divided as we are into forty-eight political groups, we do not have to make the same experiments at the same time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In view of the fact that smallpox is a disease which originates in filth and that Dr. C. Killick Millard, in a recent book, entitled </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Vaccination Question,</span><span class="font7"> stated that in ten years the deaths from vaccinia had several times outnumbered those from smallpox, it is probably true that vaccinia, so far as the community is concerned, is the more serious disease of the two.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Prof. Alfred Russell Wallace, noted British publicist and statesman, says, “The conclusion, is in every case the same; that vaccination is a gigantic delusion; that it has never saved a single life; but that it has been the cause of so much disease, so many deaths, such a vast amount of utterly needless and altogether undeserved suffering, that it will be classed by the coming-generation among the greatest errors of an ignorant and prejudiced age, and its penal enforcement the foulest blot on the generally beneficent course of legislation during our century.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As far as toxin-antitoxin is concerned, Austria has forbidden its use, and as less than ten percent of children would contract diphtheria, if left entirely alone, and toxin-antitoxin fails in about fifteen percent of its cases, the objectors against the bug system seem to have some basis for their objections. They have another basis in the fact that at the Illinois training school for nurses all incoming nurses were required to be inoculated. There were thus two groups, one inoculated, and the other not inoculated, and when diphtheria became prevalent there were more cases of disease among the nurses who had been inoculated than among the other group Avho had not been inoculated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Claim to Infallibility</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is not just clear at what point in his career a medical student becomes infallible and thereafter not responsible to anybody for his acts, but it would seem as though this era must begin either just before he becomes a hospital intern or just afterward. In no other business, except the financial business, and perhaps not even in that, is there such an ironclad arrangement for preventing practitioners from suffering the due results of their own ignorance or carelessness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In effect, when a citizen sues a physician for malpractice he sues all the doctors in the state. The medical societies defend and indemnify their members. Whenever a fellow member is charged with malpractice, every doctor in his state stands to lose his own money unless the member is acquitted, and every member of the society is required to assist in every way possible to prevent conviction and to secure acquittal. The medical societies pay all expenses for witnesses, and special remuneration for testifying favorably.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No physician a member of a medical society, in his intercourse with a patient under the care of another physician, may give any hints relative to the nature and treatment of the patient’s disorder, nor- do anything whatever to diminish the trust reposed in the attending physician even if he knows that the attending physician is prescribing incorrectly or is even endangering the patient’s life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Whenever- a woman requires treatment at a hospital for a badly performed abortion, the abortionist becomes known; yet medical ethics prevent the exposure and punishment called for by the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The foregoing advantages do not apply to doctors who do not belong to a regular allopathic association. Those not so belonging are liable to arrest at any time for “practicing” medicine without a license. Such arrests are made by the state at the instance of the “regulars”, and the latter supply the witnesses which the state requires to make out a case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Not Wholly Altruistic</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are some who think that the American Medical Association is not wholly altruistic. They point to the opposition of the association to a law under which 14,000 veterans had appealed for aid to the government. There seems to have been a desire to secure for private physicians most or all of the $5,000,000 which the government was paying to its physicians to care for these men. The men themselves were sufferers from this agitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hospitals are not wholly the generous and noble institutions they are usually supposed to be, because about one out of every three absolutely refuse to accept patients from doctors who are not attached to the hospital’s staff. Men dangerously ill have died in ambulances because trundled from one hospital to another when the doctor in charge of the case was not the right one to suit the hospital. A doctor complained bitterly because a relative of his, not under his professional charge, was levied upon for roentgenology, blood chemistry, etc., to the extent of $220, nine-tenths of which, in his judgment, was unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That vaccination is not always urged from motives of generosity and good will is indicated by Andrew S. Draper, commissioner of education, New York state, who said in his Fifth Annual Report, January 25, 1909: “In many cases physicians become interested in the strict enforcement of the law because of the fees resulting therefrom . . . in the more populous districts the medical fees resulting from vaccination are an important item . . . this mercenary motive has been the controlling factor in a sufficient number of cases which have come to the attention of this department to justify the above assertion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As an illustration of the sordid views which are held by some physicians, consider the following statement made December, 1926, before the Annual Conference of Illinois Health Officers held at Alton, Illinois, Dr. Mathew Pfeif-fenberger, president of the Illinois State Medical Society said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Prevention practiced to its utmost will create more work for the physician and not diminish it, for the full time health officer will be educating his community constantly. There will be more vaccination, more immunizing, more consulting and use of the physician. His services would be increased many fold. I am informed that epidemic and endemic infections cause only 12 percent of all deaths and that this percentage is declining rapidly. Only 15 percent of all children would ever get diphtheria, even under epidemic conditions, while 100 percent are prospects for toxin-antitoxin. The percentage who would get smallpox, under present conditions, is even less; but 100 percent are prospects for vaccination. Scarlet fever will soon come in for its 100 percent also, as it may for measles, judging from the reports on that disease. Typhoid fever is disappearing due to sanitation, but vaccination should be used when the individual travels into unknown territory, and countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not all great physicians would be willing to give expression to such ignoble sentiments. W. C. Gorgas, M. D., formerly surgeon-general of the United States army, made the wise and statesmanlike observation that •'■'poverty is the greatest of all breeders of disease and the stone wall against which every sanitarian must impinge”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Again, James Gordon Cumming, M. D., made the statement that “the eradication of diphtheria will not come through the serum treatment of patients, by the immunization of the well, or through the accurate clinical and laboratory diagnosis of the case, and the carrier followed by quarantine; rather it will be attained through the mass sanitary protection of the populace subconsciously practiced by the people at all times”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is not more bugs the people need, but more income, a better share of the good things of this life. Studies in infant mortality made by the Children’s Bureau, Washington, D. C., show that—</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The infant mortality rate shows a marked and almost regular decline as the father’s earnings become larger. For the group of babies in which the father’s earnings are less than $450 per annum, the infant mortality rate is 242.9 per 1,000 live births, while in the next group, in which the father earns from $450 to $549, the rate is 173.6. It rises very slightly in the next class, $550 to $649 to 174.5, and thereafter drops steadily with each advance in economic status. The rate, however, does not fall below 100 until the father’s earnings reach $1,050 or more. Babies whose fathers earn $1,250 and over per annum have a death rate of only 58.3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">No Tyranny, Please &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It, seems better to listen to the American people when they are in the mood of saying, “No tyranny, please,” than to listen to them when they say, “NO TYRANNY!” Parents have a right to have their child educated, and a right to know that when he returns home at night he will come home without any parts missing.. In Newark, girls have been stripped to the waist in the public schools in the presence of others and then sent home to be treated for diseases which upon closer examination were found absent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What right has any man to say to another man that he intends to terrify him with respect to 1200 kinds of bugs, to drive the man insane and to make his life a sorrow, when he might never have need for one of the bugs from his birth to his box? It is probably true as claimed that these bug specialists do more harm to the minds of the people by their bug philosophy than they actually do with the bugs themselves, yet see what they propose: Dr. J. W. Hodge says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has been recommended that all domestics be examined by official inspectors before being admitted into a household; that all school pupils have their throats officially inspected every morning before entering school; that all the children, in our public schools be injected at stated intervals with antitoxin in order to immunize them against diphtheria; that it is dangerous for even a healthy person to spit upon the sidewalks; that it is not safe for men to wear whiskers; that it is dangerous to frequent the town post-office or the court-room unless these are daily disinfected; that it is not safe to enter a department store, a theater or a trolley car that is not daily fumigated; that it is dangerous to receive letters written by a consumptive or handled by consumptive clerks or carriers; that it is not safe to use plates, cups, knives, forks or spoons in restaurants or hotels because the simple rinsing of these articles in boiling water is not sufficient to kill the microbes; that it is not safe to drink water which has not been sterilized; that it is unsafe to eat vegetables that have not been washed in sterilized water; that it is dangerous to eat the flesh of bovine species until it has been cooked sufficiently to destroy the tubercle bacilli; that for the same reason it is dangerous to eat butter, cheese, cream or milk that has not been pasteurized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And Dr. W. A. Evans, formerly Commissioner of Health of Chicago, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As I see it, the wise thing for the medical profession to do is to get right into and man every great health movement; man health departments, tuberculosis societies, child and infant welfare societies, housing societies, etc. The future of the profession depends on keeping matters so that when the public mind thinks of these things, it automatically thinks of physicians, and not of sociologists or sanitary engineers. The profession cannot afford to have these places occupied by others than medical men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Is It Ozone That We Smell?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">TS IT ozone that we smell when electricity is ■A in the air? Seems to us that is what we have heard? Well there is ozone, then, in and about the position of national chairman of the republican party. In fact the smell of ozone in this administration is as pungent as the smell of oil in the ones that went before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It seems that nobody denies that Chairman Huston has been and is the Washington representative of the branch of the Power Trust which is called the Tennessee Ei ver Improvement Association, and is specifically entrusted by and for itself with the prevention of the government’s getting anything out of its $150,000,000 power plant at Muscle Shoals. “The people be —” stung.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It seems that in the writing of the Muscle Shoals plank in both the republican and democratic platforms Mr. Huston had a large hand. It is said that he has disbursed $156,000 in Washington in four years. Legislation comes high.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now it so happens that Mr. Huston got pinched in the stock market squeeze in New York, and that money which was solicited to keep the Muscle Shoals project from being of any benefit to the people who paid for it was sent to Nev,<sup>7</sup> York and used to buy stocks on a margin. Many people v/ould consider this gambling with other people’s money. But a G.O.P. chairman is impeccable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mr, Huston says he will not resign. No doubt he remembers what happened during the Teapot Dome administrations and how they got away with it, and thinks anything will go. And it looks as if it would. Call &quot;Will Hays and Andrew Mellon to the stand. Or recall Harry M. Daugherty or Mr. Fall,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Califoraia’s Old Age Pensions </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By John F. Dawn, (Calif.')</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">TN THE April 16 number of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The- Golden Age </span><span class="font7">A you name ten honorable states that pay old age pensions. In this list was California. I am sorry to be compelled to strike California from the ‘honorable’ list. The legislature did heed the insistent demand of the press and people, and did pass a lav/, and did report to the press, and it was published. It read that any man or woman 70 years old or older who had been a resident of the state for fifteen or more years was eligible for a state pension of $30 a month. The press announcement caused universal rejoicing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I took the trouble to make a personal investigation of this law, for I knew something of California politics. It required two days to run down any office holder who knew anything of the law. Finally a bright stenographer recalled having seen a clipping in the office. She made a search and found it. Then I was sent to the “Community Chest” secretary. This chest raises about $200,000 a year on the plea of charity, about $30,000 of it being allotted to the “Chest” for emergency demands. The underground war agencies get most of the balance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The lady in charge informed me that any pauper who met the legal requirements of the law, and passed the examination of the charity chest examiner, could receive $15 a month from the city, and could then apply to the state for a like amount, but that the chest preferred to advance emergency rations or rent, that the individual or others might take up the burden and relieve the city, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">temporary aid being their only thought.</span><span class="font7"> The politicians had put over a boost for themselves and a frost for the aged.

The only ones then that will need to eat will be those who own the machinery, with an occasional half a peanut to the scientists and other mental workers. This brings us to the interesting question as to whether or not the peanuts will be planted, harvested and roasted by robots. Maybe so. Maybe so.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Events in Canada </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Our Canadian Correspondent</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If the the Ku Klux Klan been in existence in JUL Moses’ day and had their way, he would not have been permitted to marry Zipporah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Recently a colored man of Ontario and a white woman were about to be married, when the Klan members swooped down upon them and took the girl back to her mother. But they</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">were subsequently married. The Klan members, however, did not get off scot-free for taking the law into their own hands, but were haled into court and fined $50. The attorney general, not being satisfied, had the case appealed and the fine was raised to $250. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This conviction of the Ku Klux Klan mem-her for having his face masked without lawful excuse draws attention to a little known and seldom invoked clause in the criminal code of Canada. Section 464 of the code says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Everyone is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to five years imprisonment who is found</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“'having his face masked or blackened or being otherwise disguised by night without lawful excuse, the proof whereof shall lie with him; or</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“having his face masked or blackened, or being otherwise disguised, by day, with intent to commit any indictable offence.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Convictions recorded in Canada under these clauses of the law might perhaps be counted on the fingers of two hands. There it stands, however, as an instrument for the restraint of any citizens who are tempted to introduce what is known as ‘night riding’ into this country. In various parts of the United States the Ku Klux Klan has been guilty of taking the law into its own hands, usually by sending a band of masked men at night to confront the individual whose conduct is objected to. This method of regulating society -cannot be tolerated in Canada, and it is a good thing that the penal law was promptly invoked when the first attempt at “mob justice” appeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Religion’s Intrusion Resented</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The refusal of Mr. Justice Duclos to hold court until a large crucifix that had been placed in his court room was removed caused a great stir in Montreal, and in this connection </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Sentinel</span><span class="font7"> states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">' The matter came to a head yesterday morning when the judge withdrew from the court room and refused to sit there because of the placing on the wall immediately facing him, of a large crucifix between four and five feet in height. For the remainder of the day, he heard the cases on his roll in chambers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Speaking of the matter of the crucifix, Mr. Justice Duclos made it clear this morning that his action was not due to any disbelief in or disrespect to our Saviour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Asa Protestant, ’ ’ he said, ‘ ‘ I have a great respect and reverence for our Saviour. It is my belief, however, that images of this kind should not be hung in court rooms where perhaps they may become the object of jeers on the part of certain persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“My idea in this connection is that the image of the Saviour should be found in the hearts of his followers and not on the walls of buildings. As a Protestant, I have objected to the placing of the crucifix in the court room where I have to sit. I have done this without consulting with any of my brother Protestant judges and in this regard have spoken only for myself.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. Justice Duclos explained further’ that he had asked the sheriff to have the crucifix removed from his court room by 10 o’clock yesterday morning. The sheriff had replied that he would refer the matter to the Attorney-General of the Province. When the time came yesterday for the opening of the court, the crucifix was still in place on the wall of the court room and Eis Lordship at once withdrew from the room. No reply has yet been received from the AttorneyGeneral.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The incident is a sequel to a recent ceremony in the Court of King’s Bench at which thirty crucifixes, one of which was to be placed in every Court of Justice in Montreal, were blessed by the Abbe Verschelden, Chaplain of Montreal jail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Short Weight Chain Stores</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Recently five very powerful chain stores in Canada were convicted of short weighting their customers, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Hush,</span><span class="font7"> rising in justifiable indignation, criticizes in no uncertain terms the silence of the Canadian press upon the matter. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">It</span><span class="font7"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The conviction, recorded in detail on another page of this journal, of five great Canadian chain stores for short weighting their customers is a matter of National importance. Nevertheless, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Hush</span><span class="font5"> is the only newspaper in Canada to report it. In no other country in the world could such a serious thing occur without full publicity, so that the public, who have been fleeced systematically out of millions, might be on their guard. We warn everybody who buys anything by weight at these five stores to make sure that they get full value for their money and insist on having everything of this nature weighed before their eyes before paying for it. This is the only method to adopt with cheaters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">None of the Toronto dailies dare report these fraud convictions, much less comment on them, because these chain stores, Eatons, Loblaws, Dominion Stores, Arnolds Stores and Red and White, hold the advertisers’ club over their heads. Why don’t the four Toronto dailies get together on this, in the same way that they did when they raised the price of their papers from one to two cents, and one and all publish the details of these frauds on their reading public and tell these cheating’ concerns to go to Hell. These tradesmen, are just as dependent on the newspapers for advertising as the newspapers are upon them . . . more so, if the Toronto newspaper proprietors had the sense to see it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">A Thrilling Story of the Late War, Told in the Language of-the Trenches</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Copyright, 1930, by Daniel E. Morgan </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">O</span><span class="font7">THER troops were brought in and passed through, leaving us as a support. For miles at a time we marched on after them, through the swamps and through the mud, often wet clear up to the waist. When marching along the side-hills we were pestered by the airplanes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many a time a whole battalion of machine guns opened up upon the planes. The streams of bullets could be seen in the air by their tracers (a sort of light on every third bullet). I shot at them myself with a 45-calibre automatic Colt revolver. One or two of them were shot down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">November, 1918</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was now November, 1918, and the nights were bitter cold. Vve dug in, in the woods. Some of the boys who had been left behind to care for the mules forged their way up with food. What courage they had!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I sat all night and pounded my legs, to keep them from freezing, half crying for food and warmth. My hands became so benumbed that it was impossible to open or close a button. It became a tragedy to police oneself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sickness and disease crept upon us. The strongest men fell out exhausted. The doctors tagged hundreds and sent them to the rear. What were left of the whole division had become wrecks, yet some of us, knowing nothing but obedience to the bitter end, kept on. We did not want it to be said that we could not see it through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That was a peace-time training: a false standard of pride and selfishness. Obedience ’ Obedience! We were in bondage to it, and although half dead we still hung on. It is true that once a thing is thoroughly learned, and believed to be true, the body can be completely wrecked and yet the mind refuses to change. God alone looseth the prisoners,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A Man Among Men</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of our young captains was returned to us, Captain Schiesswohl. He was wounded during the battle of Chateau Thierry. He was a prince of a lad. He &quot;was assigned to my platoon of four machine guns and crews. Unlike many others, he brought with him a can of jelly, which he shared with us. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He said to me, “Sergeant Morgan, if you ever come to Chicago, look me up and I will guarantee you one of the finest times you ever had.” It seemed a shame that when a man was once wounded they would not let him stay out of it. But no, he was patched up, and if he still had enough mentality to understand an order, he was commanded to re-enter the slaughter, to be done up right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All through the war I had placed my own gun crews in their positions of defense or attack. Now* &quot;with a real captain I got the friendly order, “Morgan, you dig a hole for us to crawl into and I will place the guns.” I already felt a measure of safety with some one helping to shoulder the responsibility of machine gun crews during a battle. Behind the lines there are too many telling what to do and how to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Schiesswohl’s Disappointment</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We were in the Meuse-Argonne swamps. I took two or three men and began digging a hole about six feet square, so that several of us could bunk together. When we had it down below the surface of the ground the water began running in. We worked hard, but all our work was in vain, unless we lay in the water— not so good in the wintertime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The captain came back. It was now about dusk. He looked at the hole and then turned to me with pitiful eyes. He gave me the nicest bawling out that a grandfather ever gave a grandson who had been playing in the mud. He said, “I trusted you, and depended upon you, and now all I get is a hole full of water.” He was almost crying, and so was I.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We must get down below the surface for protection, and that right soon, for there is never any time to be lost during a battle. We bailed out the water with our mess tins and sunk a hole within a hole. The lower hole was the sump to catch the water, and when it filled we would take turns bailing it out. The upper hole we covered with brush from the trees in the woods, and we lay there waiting for food and orders. Orders! Orders!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There -were several days of waiting, as I remember it, and no rations reached us. Some one had a box of hard-tack, the most miserable of foods. We found methods of steaming it, and with some salt that had become red from rust we portioned it among us and dined gratefully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We lay quiet all day, listening to the various sounds of the different guns, and trying to figure out what was going on on the other side. Would we ever eat again? I cannot say how long it was that we -waited and -waited for food, watching all night, hoping and sometimes murmuring mumbled prayers. We must have food. There were mighty few dead bodies to rob here in the swamps, and the searching netted us only rusty salt, which -was kept in the end of one of the ration cans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Men Went Mad, and the Reason</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bang 1 A rifle shot in the next hole! What nonsensical bellowing! “There is a German in my dugout. Oh! There he is 11 got him!” Shrieking and yelling indescribable sounds, a man had gone stark mad and blown the head off the boy that lay with him in the hole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There stood the madman, with drooping shoulders, and a limp body, silent. He would obey no more orders. His mind was wrecked. He was seized and led to the rear. I had powerful impulses to kill him and put him out of his misery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another night came on. Surely, we thought, they would find us with the rations tonight. All the dreary night we watched and listened for some signs of the muleteers bringing food to us. It would soon be dawn and they could not reach us in the daytime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why, oh, why did they not hurry? We gave up in despair. When the morning came some of us were crying like kids. That is all we were anyway, kids, frightened kids, doing what we were told to do, obeying orders, and that without asking any questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Private Madison, one of the boys from my crew, who had been left behind this time as a muleteer, forced his way through 'with the rations. He was a brave and courageous lad. He knew what it was to be at the front waiting for food. We asked him, “But where is the food, lad?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Well, you see, I was the only one to get through, and they stopped me at P. C. (Post Command dugout) and helped themselves to it. Majors and captains must eat, you know. They are the brains of the war. If one of them starved to death the war would be lost.” .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“What have you got?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He had a couple of loaves of stale bread that had a few tablespoonfuls of flour in them, and the Devil knows what else, and a can the size of a hundred-pound flour* barrel filled with bacon. That is to say, it was filled with bacon when it started, but now there was a gallon or so of bacon grease left in it. We divided the bread among us, and drank all the bacon grease. My stomach has never felt the same since. Days later, when we got some better food, I could not eat it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Rumors of Peace</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It came to the ninth of November, 1918. The rumors were that a peace treaty might be signed. It held some interest for us, but not much. We were cold, wet and hungry. The past thousand years had been a hard one on us, for a thousand years was what it seemed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Should we live until the -war ended? It would never end. Wo were now part of an endless arrangement of murder and oppression, grinding, crushing out the lives of the poor innocents. Others would be born to take our places. There would be no end to it. We were old men now, though in years we were but youths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">November 10 came, and the orders were to cross the Meuse River. It was getting dark, but half-frozen bodies were attempting to obey the will of captured minds. Inasmuch as the order was to cross the river, then across the river we must go. The whole devilish military arrangement is built upon obedience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We lay along the woods for a few minutes. I fell asleep, and so did half the company. The march toward the river continued. We were still asleep. Some one wakened us. We hurried and closed up our ranks. This little happening was charged against me after* the war had ended, and I was up for a court martial, but proved that, after all, it was the absent officer's job to start his company moving, and not mine, as I was only a sergeant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The battle raged. Shots and shells were flying in all directions. It was very dark. The mist was hanging low along the river. A few of us crawled along a stone fence. It looked as if there was a path on the other side of the fence. Some of us jumped over, only to land in the water and get all wet and then climb back again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">AA'e were on the railroad tracks. Flares were being sent up to light the river side. There was some kind of railroad shanty on fire. Out of the mist it looked like burning coals or a halfwrecked city. Cold and shivering, we were drawn to the fire like a moth to a light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bang! The tracks curled up like magic. Two or three of us jumped down over the bank and under a wet blanket stole a smoke to quiet our twitching nerves. High explosive shells, with terrific force, tore through the ranks, wreaking havoc as they went. This did not look much as if an armistice would be signed in the morning, but even in the battle the rumors were that the next day would be the last day of the war. It might be so, but we did not know. It sounded so very queer. Would the morning ever come?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I lay down between the ties on the left side of the track and fell asleep. I dreamed that my father (then dead) and I were in some far-off war, fighting like mad. I awoke in a daze, bewildered, and endeavored to make a start in some direction, only to find that my legs, benumbed from the cold and water, were useless from the hips down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Darkness and mists shielded us from the eyes of the enemy. The efforts of our battalions to throw across pontoon bridges had been delayed. Enemy shells blew them up as fast as they were laid. Many brave engineers were killed or drowned in the cold waters of the Meuse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After pounding and massaging my limbs the blood began to circulate. It looked like certain death to try to cross the Meuse now. However, our battalion was the next to try it, and try we must, unless the dawn of another day should appear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What a horrid night it had been! Everything was covered with white frost in the early morning light, and it was bitterly cold, that morning of November 11. We left half of our guns and ammunition and ran for the cover of the woods, as soon as we had crossed, and somewhere in those woods we mustered up enough strength to dig another grave-like hole in which to lie.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Last Mad Spasm</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It seemed as though both sides had an abundance of ammunition, and wanted to use it before the war stopped. Streams of heavy and light shells flew across the woods high over our heads. We heard that the potentates would cross our lines, to sign up. We also heard that they had crossed once and that the order to cease fire would be given at 11: 00 a. m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I lay in a hole half alive. Some one was there with me. The guns were pounding hard. It would seem, strange indeed if there was no shooting going on. What a nightmare it had all been. There was some unforeseen power behind it all. What was it all about, anyway? Whose war was it? Who started it? And why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Orders or commands issued from what seemed like nowhere, and yet those orders set everything m motion. Nation had risen against nation, and whole kingdoms against kingdoms, and this had resulted in famines and pestilence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These orders had stopped at nothing. These orders had changed the peace-time industries of a great nation into machinery of war and destruction. Orders that sent or took from peaceful homes the fathers and the sons. Orders that ground out equipment of war to harness them with. Orders that sent them to far-off shores, to be slaughtered like so many cattle. Orders that gathered out from among men any and every peaceful, order-loving man that dared say he is a Christian and does not like war. Orders that assemble such Christians like criminals for trial. Mob orders or laws that sent them off to smutty jails to live until they should die. Orders that said this earth is no place for those who follow the Prince of Peace—away with such men 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">November 11, and the war was going to end at eleven o’clock. Why should it ever have begun? But why reason thus? Were not the bands playing over there, such weird and inspiring music that it made one want to fight? Was not everybody urging everybody else off to the front? Did not the girls, old maids and others, hand out hot drinks and sandwiches? The nations, as I now think of it, had gone mad for v/ar. Indeed, the whole world had gone mad. Had we not wished to come? Surely we had. What false enthusiasm it all was! Did not the preachers, everywhere, urge the shedding of blood? Did they not say it was all right? What a twisted affair it had all been! And now it was going to end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At about eleven o’clock a. m., a little sooner or later, we did not know, it did not matter, the guns stopped firing. Everything seemed as if it had stopped, even the earth on its axis. What a sorrowful, dead silence! A maddening silence. It did not seem right. The silence was worse than the noise of battle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After a little while some of the boys began to move around. There was no yelling or shouting in our ranks, no enthusiasm. We were a wretched lot. The thing was too unreal. Someone came through with the report that the war had ended. Ah! what did we care? We lay in our holes for about an hour longer, sick and weary of soul. Our homes and friends were a million miles away, so it seemed, and as for us, we had been crushed in the jaws of a cruel war, and were done for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Someone started a bonfire. We crawled out of our holes. A little fire, some heat, how good it felt. Down to the river banks we went, seeking some kind of food. What horrible scenes met our eyes, the dead caught in the last gnash of a cruel and wicked war!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Had not the generals known three days before that the armistice would be signed? Why all this waste of human life on the last night, November 10? We all agreed that it had been a great mistake to continue the carnage, as we viewed the bodies of the poor unfortunates that should have been alive. There had been a trafficking in the blood of the poor innocents, a grand-stand play before the war ended. It would look nice on paper that “the Marines have crossed the Meuse”, but the casualties for the night of November 10 Avere 600.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus ended the greatest campaign of organized murder ever attempted since the world began. The losses of the Second Division, in this conflict, were 24,432, as the record shows.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Egypt’s Lone Chiropractor</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">P</span><span class="font7">EOPLE may think that heroes do not exist any more, but when I was in Cairo, Egypt, in January, 1930, down with an acute attack of bronchitis, I found one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">His address is Makine B. Maroon, Doctor of Chiropractic, Bab-El-Hadid Square, Cairo, Egypt, and he is holding his own successfully against the whole medical profession of Egypt. Here is his story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">About twelve years ago three young and ambitious Egyptians started for America to study medicine. By a peculiar turn of fate a prospectus of a chiropractic college came into their hands. Two of these youths ridiculed the whole thing and went to the University of Chicago to study medicine, but while at college they both died from pneumonia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The false gods of Allopathic-Pseudo Science could not save them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The third one went to a chiropractic college and finished his course in due time. He practiced here for a while and then returned to his native land, which was seven years ago, full of ambitions and hopes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">Hi</span><span class="font7">s father, a very influential man in Upper Egypt, could not understand this new science and felt that his son had squandered his money and time foolishly. “Why did you not become a doctor, like everyone else,” the disappointed father kept asking. “I have learned something far superior to that,” replied the young chiropractor each time. But the old fellow could not see it, and Dr. Maroon was in despair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. N. S. Hanoi™</span><span class="font7"> (A. U. C.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At last, certain in his faith, he decided to do something out of the ordinary to convince first his relatives and then the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There was living in the village an old man, paralyzed and bedridden for years. Medical Science had given him up long ago as an incurable and hopeless case. One morning Dr. Maroon went to his father and told him that he was going to give him the proof of the value of chiropractic by helping this old invalid. The father thought that his son had gone out of his mind. He argued with him, tried to persuade him to give up this mad idea. He tried to show him what a disgrace he would bring upon his respected and well known family if he failed. But Dr. Maroon had determination and great faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The invalid was carried on a stretcher from the village to Cairo and lodged near the doctor’s office. Every day willing hands carried him to the chiropractic table to get the adjustments. Patiently, every day for months Dr. Maroon worked over him, manipulating and adjusting the spine. Many people had become interested by this time and were divided into two camps. Dr. Maroon’s family and clan prayed for his success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After three months of continuous work results became apparent. Nature, with the help of chiropractic science, asserted itself, and the old body could stand with the help of crutches. To the populace a miracle had happened, but to Dr. Maroon it was another proof of the value of his science. Dr. Maroon’s father, family and friends rallied to his support. The people began to inquire about this new science, and pretty soon Dr. Maroon's office resembled the shrine of Lourdes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The medical doctors, seeing this success, instead of learning the new method, as any rational and God-fearing doctor would do, began to harass him and call him all kinds of names. All the epithets that they deserved were heaped upon the young pioneer. They framed him, as it is their custom, and brought him to court. Happily, the judges in Egypt are of a different caliber from that in our land. They asked Dr. Maroon to produce evidence that he cured people 'without drugs. Dozens of cases were produced in court, to the amazement of the judge and all present. They related their stories of years of useless treatment by drugs and injections and of the almost miraculous benefits they received from chiropractic. Dr. Maroon was acquitted amid the acclamation of all present. They do not bother him any more. The most famous attorney in Egypt and many other prominent and intelligent people became converted to chiropractic and are his patients.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To spend a few hours at the doctor’s clinic is an inspiring sight. I was fortunate in being able to obtain his valuable services during my illness, and take advantage of this opportunity to acknowledge my gratitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dr. Maroon has one ambition. He would like to have more drugless practitioners in Egypt. The field is large. The pioneering work has been done. He has the ambition to establish a drugless hospital and a drugless school. Drugless healers of the United States, here is your chance. Down there in the old ’Land of the Nile’, you will have the opportunity of bringing back to the modern Egyptians a truth so well known to the ancient Egyptians, that body health radiates from within.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Drugless healers of the United States, the land of Egypt is calling to you. Will you hearken to the call or let this lone chiropractor carry on the fight and face the enemy alone? I hope you will hearken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Geographical Factors in History </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Frank L. Brown (London)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;K/TAN and his environment is a profitable 1VJL source of study, particularly to the Bible student.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The climatic and physical forces of nature have made themselves felt in every age, in every clime, upon all the human race since Adam left the sanctuary of Eden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “geographical control” is a mighty factor in explaining the differences that are manifested in the various races of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The geographical control or configuration of a country is the form and arrangement of mountains, valleys, high and low lands, barren deserts and frozen wastes. Size and direction of rivers are also important.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The effect of desert upon man’s organism is tremendous. The steppes, tundras and sandy deserts of Russia and Mongolia have left their mark on the Russian Tartar and the Turkoman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The glare of the snow, operating for centuries upon the human organism, has produced squinting eyes and bushy eyebrows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Buckle is authority for the statement that the highly-wrought imagination and gross superstition of the people of India are due to the presence of great mountains. The overpowering forces of nature excite the fancy and paralyze reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This undoubtedly accounts for the gross superstition among fishermen and sailors. Years of toil battling against the terrible storms, knowing nature only in its dreadful aspect, grips the mind and warps judgment. This might account for their liberality, childish tendencies and their impetuousness which so often manifest themselves when they are ashore. The restraint is temporarily removed and they are happy and care-free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Imagine the effect upon the Israelites who, inured to the plains of Egypt, where natural features are small and nature is appealing and gentle, were brought face to face with the overpowering terrors of the mountains of Sinai.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Food is dependent upon the climate and geographical elements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The pygmies of Central Africa are the product of centuries of scanty food supply and excessive inbreeding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The climatic control is equally powerful. Carl Ritter regarded the small slit eyes and swollen lids of inhabitants of Eastern 'Asia as the effect of the bitter winds. The high cheek-bones and short necks are the result of raising the shoulders to protect the neck against the cold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bitter cold winds play havoc with the features, and continued action completely distorts them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The hot climate of the Orient is a powerful factor inducing the peoples to lethargy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This mental lethargic tendency, or mental inertia, is attributable to climatic conditions. The effect of this mental inertia is noticeable in the dislike of change, whether the change be of religious habits, marriage customs, manners, or ethnic immobility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is quite possible that along this avenue of reasoning of geographic and climatic conditions, coupled with the variety of food and its varied supply and isolation of peoples, we may find that they have so operated upon man’s organism as to cause his skin to lose its original pigment, and to brand him black, white, or yellow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Individual isolation is injurious; and it is clearly proved that it is equally so with a collective number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The inhabitants of Britain are rapidly deteriorating, due to isolation and its concomitants ; while the cosmopolitan population of America is producing some of the finest physical and mental specimens of the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Adam left Eden the process of change began; by the time his day had ended, his whole organism was sadly affected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How much more these geographical controls ..affected Noah may be readily understood when we read </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font7"> and note the tremendous change at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The wilderness journey of the Israelites worked as a potent factor upon their mental and physical organism. After their life in Egypt the different food supply operating on the glands must in course of time have strengthened or modified the people’s characteristics, in one or more directions. Jehovah knew what was good for them, and also the effects of such food and environment upon their organism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It must be recognized that the geographical elements, and man’s relation thereto, lie at the root of many racial differences and distinctions. . Rivers and oceans have also manifested their influences upon man’s organism. In every coast region shortness of stature, compensated with chest and arm development, is due to man’s long association with the oar and net. The sea dwellers are extremely temperamental, responding to the restless elements in the ebb and flow of human emotion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Rivers have afforded channels of communication and have provided means of development and progression; whereas mountain barriers have barred man’s progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Cratometer Treatments Versus Spectacles </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Homer E. Walden (Kentucky)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">V</span><span class="font7">ERY few people know that it is possible to keep the eyes young. In fact very few eye specialists know that it can be successfully accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As is well known to eye specialists, the near point of vision recedes gradually from the time one is born until the time comes when the person is supposed to have no power at all within the eye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the time comes that a person finds it is necessary to have seme help (glasses) to read with (this condition begins in life at approximately forty years of age), they apply to some eye specialist for a pair of glasses, which is almost always supplied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are two ways of correcting this trouble: one is with glasses, the other is to give treatments which consist of eye exercises andcratom-eter applications. The cratometer is an instrument which is used specially for the purpose of stimulating the nerves in and around the eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These treatments are taken in the (optometrist’s) office, and take about half an hour for each treatment. The number of treatments re-’ quired will depend chiefly on the age of the patient. At forty-five years of age perhaps ten treatments will do; the older, the more treatments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It might be of some benefit to add that these treatments would not be given to any person suffering from arterio sclerosis, which is a thickening and hardening of the arteries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The above treatments are especially fine for persons around forty to fifty-five years of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This is written for the purpose of adding one more little point to the evidence at hand, to wit: we are living in the day of the LORD’S presence, and nothing should surprise us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Philosophy of the Morning Brush </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. Charles II. Rhoads (Calif.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE skin is next to the lungs as a breathingunit of the body; but, more important, it is one of the chief organs of elimination. It would be impossible for us to live if all the pores of the skin were hermetically sealed ; consequently it is very important that these pores remain open. I use the brushing technique with many of my patients, and find it very beneficial in many cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The reasons for the results are these. The pores, in spite of the most rigid cleansing precautions, will become more or less filmed over. The area around the skin is fed entirely by capillaries, which are very small vessels and need muscle massage for the flow of blood to be normal and properly nourish the area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The brushing eliminates the two factors above mentioned, insomuch as it will absolutely remove all film, oil, etc., and at the same time massage the skin tissue, thereby enhancing the capillary flow. A suggestion I often offer my patients is this: If you find the brush too harsh, use a turkish towel and rub briskly, always remembering to rub toward the heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I delight in the articles published, especially along health lines, and I thank God there is one publication left that is not afraid of the American Medical Association and their henchmen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Drawing the Prohibition Line</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE other day, in Buffalo, two items in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Courier-Express</span><span class="font7"> attracted our attention, both of them on the front page.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first was an item showing that the Cunard Line, with permission from the state department, will charter three ships of the Anchor line, which ships will operate on a series of five-day cruises out of New York, loaded down with a generous supply of liquors, wines, ale, stout and beer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This will enable the representatives of the Power Trust, who manufacture electric current at less than 3/4c a kilowatt hour and sell it to the rest of us at fancy prices, usually around 9c or 10c a kilowatt hour, and all the rest of those Wall Street magnates to whom we owe so much for maneuvering the United States into its present condition, to go out where it is safe to do it and get just as beastly blind drunk as they know how to get.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then they can come back to New York happy and be in better shape to issue orders to editors how to mold public opinion, instruct the government at Washington what to do next, and how and when to do it, and tell the necessary judges their part in the program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the same front page we notice that in Illinois a sixty-six-year-old revenue act has been invoked to bring about the forfeiture of two large farms with the confiscation of all the buildings thereon because stills were found in some of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is one thing about it. We Americans are bound to have the prohibition laws enforced. We have a great respect for law and order in this country, especially in Illinois, where we point with pride to Chicago. As far as the ocean is concerned, everybody knows that that is wot anyway.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">I have been going to write you for some time, in regard to the lectures to -which I have listened on Sunday mornings, to inform you how much I appreciate your presentation of the subjects handled by you, and to which a multitude of people have listened. I cannot see how anyone should accuse you of receiving anything from any source, either for or against Prohibition or any other theme so ably handled by you, as to me it appeared unbiased; you spoke from a Scriptural standpoint, and not to please or displease any men or set of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As minister of the First Christian church here in Benton Harbor for fifteen years, but now for some years independent, and preaching for the City Mission, without compensation, I have had experience with the preachers of this modern age and realize how many are carried away with the thought that they must cleanse and purify the world; and this is the danger of this age, that the human is exalted, instead of giving glory and honor to Jehovah, who at the proper’ time, when the Christ shall reign, will make wars to cease to the ends of the earth,.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I have seen some of the splendid things you brought out in your lectures, for some years, and do hope that you may continue the Sunday morning lectures for the enlightenment of the human race, who need teaching above everything else, as they are being preached ‘to death; but how few real teachers are found to give the people the sincere milk of the Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Trusting to hear your voice again from time to time, in vital messages of truth on behalf of the kingdom of God,</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">A Question and Answer</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19300806_files/g_E_19300806-17.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:21pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">QUESTION:</span><span class="font7"> Was not God unjust in condemning Adam to death for the comparatively small offense of eating the forbidden fruit? Moreover, it was Adam’s </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">first</span><span class="font7"> offense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font7"> Very few people recognize either the enormity of Adam’s offense or the wickedness connected therewith. In thinking of Adam’s transgression, we are prone to compare it with the offenses of men in our day. This is not proper. Adam was a perfect man, with perfect mind and reasoning faculties; moreover, he had an accurate understanding of what God required of him. In 1 Timothy 2:14, we read: “Adam was not deceived.” He was created in the “image of God”, and therefore had </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">full control</span><span class="font7"> of all his faculties. This means that he was fully able to resist any temptation that came to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He was, therefore, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">fully</span><span class="font7"> responsible for his act, and no excuse can be offered for him. There were no extenuating circumstances in connection with his sin. Had there been, Justice would have demanded a lesser penalty. His sin was the result of a wilful and wicked heart condition, due to the fact that he had allowed selfishness to enter his heart. His act was one of treason toward his Creator and Benefactor. He had, on account of allowing selfishness to creep into his heart, lost all sense of responsibility toward his Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Because of the fact that all of Adam’s posterity were born in sin, and shapen in iniquity: born with imperfect minds, imperfect reasoning faculties, imperfect judgments, and imperfect ■wills; born with inherited violent tempers, and with selfish, envious and jealous dispositions, and controlled by passion and prejudices; some more and some less insane, but all mentally deficient; with wrong conceptions of God, due to false teachings, wrong example and precepts set before them constantly by their parents and religious teachers—because of these and other deficiencies and handicaps, which Adam did not possess, it is manifestly improper and impossible to make any comparison between Adam and any of his fallen, degenerate children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Because of these handicaps, deficiencies and lack of proper information, and lack of perfect control of their faculties, it is right and just that men have made laws that carry different penalties for first, second, third and fourth offenses; right that they have first, second and third degree murder charges. These handicaps furnish varying degrees of excuse for their crimes, and materially lessen their responsibility, and hence lessen their guilt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many of the people of earth are born with certain handicaps which make it virtually impossible for them to control their words and acts. Such people need mercy, sympathy and help; and God has purposed to give them all this, during the great thousand years of Christ’s reign, when Satan will be bound so that he can no longer aggravate their inherited weaknesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During this “thousand years” Christ will extend mercy to all of Adam’s race; will give them proper instruction as to what is the truth; and will help them up out of the degradation into which Adam plunged the race by his sin, until every individual will have a perfect knowledge of what is required of him, and perfect ability to obey. Under such conditions disobedience will merit and receive the full penalty of second death, otherwise called “everlasting destruction”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another reason why </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">men</span><span class="font7"> should exercise greater lenience toward their fellow men is that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">no</span><span class="font7"> man has the power to read the heart, and thus he cannot properly estimate the degree of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">wilfulness</span><span class="font7"> therein. But God can read the heart, and knows exactly the measure of wilfulness and rebellion, and is therefore able to render a just verdict, in every case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Adam was not punished </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">simply</span><span class="font7"> for the sin of eating the forbidden fruit. That in itself was a minor point, and would, in itself, do little harm. The real sin of Adam was </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">disobedience. </span><span class="font7">He did not have a proper regard for his Creator, the one who had given him life and all the blessings of his beautiful home and environment. He did not show a proper appreciation and gratitude for these blessings, and in addition to this we must bear in mind that lie had </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">no excuse </span><span class="font7">for committing his sin. There was no lack of understanding of the significance of his crime; there were no inherent weaknesses or imperfections to urge him on. Hence his responsibility was complete. He had proven himself unworthy of life, and God was absolutely </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">just</span><span class="font7"> in taking away the privileges which he did not properly appreciate. Had God sentenced Adam to eternal torment, the sentence would have been unjust for several reasons; first, God did not tell Adam that the penalty was torment, but did tell him that the penalty was death. Secondly, such a penalty would have proven that God did not </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">deserve</span><span class="font7"> the obedience which He demanded of Adam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">, The enormity of the crime of murder does not consist of the act of firing a pistol, but does consist of the harm and injury done to another. The enormity of the crime of arson does not consist of the simple little act of lighting a, match, but does consist of the harm, injury and loss imposed , upon another by the burning of his buildings. Just so the enormity of Adam’s sin is not measured by the simple little act of eating some forbidden fruit. In addition to the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">disobedience</span><span class="font7"> involved, as well as the ingratitude shown toward his Creator, Adam’s act brought more harm and more loss to the human family than the combined sins of the race from Adam’s time until now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">His one act of disobedience brought the condemnation of death upon every member of the race. This death condemnation brought the added evils of sickness and disease; and these in turn brought pain and suffering, and made necessary all the doctors, surgeons, dentists, hospitals, nurses, drugstores, undertakers, cemeteries, and tombstones; all of which are but reminders of the fact that Adam disobeyed God, and that his children inherited his condemnation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But this is not all. The sin of Adam plunged the race into selfishness; and, spurred on by selfishness, man’s inhumanity to man has filled the earth with injustice, lies, frauds, dishonesty, crimes, wars, thefts, hatred, malice, envy, jealousy, hypocrisy, cruelty and oppression. These wicked practices, have, in turn, brought the further curse of jails, penitentiaries, poorhouses, reformatories, courthouses, courts, lawyers, judges, juries, policemen, sheriffs, constables, department of justice, the gallows, and the electric chair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And even this is not all. Mankind lost the favor of God as a result of Adam’s sin; as a result of the fall, they have lost a proper reverence for God; they neglect Bible study and prayer; because of the false and slanderous teachings about God, they have lost faith in both God and the Bible, and have come to worship idols of wood, stone, gold, silver, beasts, birds, fish, snakes, relics, the sun, the moon, stars, man-made institutions, and even their fellow men, No other crime ever wrought such havoc, such injury and such loss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The laws of men prescribe the punishment by death for the murder of a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">single</span><span class="font7"> human being. Adam’s sin has murdered over twenty billion men, women and children, and caused all the woes incidental to their death. In the light of these facts, which cannot be denied, the penalty against Adam was not only </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">just,</span><span class="font7"> but was a merciful one. In His love and pity God has determined that all the willing and obedient of Adam’s children, both the living and the dead, shall be delivered from every feature of this death curse. The wilful and disobedient, shall die the second death as unworthy of life and of God’s favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Judgment of Professed Christians </span><span class="font3">An address by Judge Rutherford broadcast June 15 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">WATCHTOWER national chain program</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font7">HEN a great crisis is reached in the affairs of men, fear takes hold upon almost every one. When announcement is made that judgment is about to be rendered, those involved await that decree with fear and trembling. The contemplation of an impending judgment is often distressing to those involved, and the judgment rendered by a worldly tribunal usually brings sorrow and mourning to some. Being informed that the day must come when all will have to he judged before the great court of Jehovah God almost all look forward to that time with great fear, trembling and distress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is the expressed will of Jehovah God that the people shall have an opportunity to know the truth. He has therefore directed those who have His Word and use it to bind up the brokenhearted and to comfort those who are sad and mourn. Much fear, trepidation and mourning is due to a lack of knowledge of God and His provisions. A proper understanding of the Word of God brings real consolation to those who believe it. Believing that this radio audience would appreciate some study of the Bible concerning the judgment and judgment day, and that you will profit thereby and receive comfort therefrom, I shall attempt to give three lectures concerning the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Today consideration is given to the judgment of God upon professed Christians or followers of Christ. Next Sunday morning consideration will be given to the judgment of the nations of the earth; and on Sunday morning the 29th we will consider the judgment of the people before the great court of the Lord. In these studies I hope you will make notes of the scriptures cited, provide yourself with a Bible and other study helps that are available, and give careful consideration to what is said; and in so doing I feel sure you will receive benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Definitions</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Judgment means a formal judicial decree delivered or entered on record by one having authority and jurisdiction of the case or subject matter under consideration. A judgment is delivered or rendered by a judge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A judge is one who judicially pronounces sentence or renders judgment. lie must be clothed, with power, authority and jurisdiction so to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Judgments may be rendered either legally or illegally. One who wrongfully assumes to render judgment does so illegally. A legal judgment is rendered by a fully qualified judge after hearing the facts, weighing the same, and applying the law to the facts. The judgment rendered by one having neither authority nor jurisdiction is void, and no one is bound to obey it. A judgment rendered by one having power or authority or jurisdiction is binding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The word issue, as used in connection with judgment, means the question or material point that is in dispute and which is submitted to the judge for determination. The issue or question in dispute may be affirmed by one and denied by another. The rights of the parties to the issue joined are considered and determined by the judge hearing the matter. When a creature is on trial before a court or judge and the question or issue is whether he has disobeyed the law, the facts are heard and the law applied to the facts, and then the judgment follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The trial or hearing of the facts must precede the rendering of the decree or judgment. It follows, therefore, that there can be no just or proper judgment rendered without a hearing or trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah God is the great Judge over all. All rightful authority proceeds from Him. Ho holds the power and jurisdiction over all matters, and therefore He can delegate that power, authority and jurisdiction to anyone whom He may choose. He is the Supreme Justice: “For Goel is judge himself.&quot;’’—Ps. 50: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God is just and merciful. “Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.” (Ps, 89:14) “The law of the Lord is perfect. ... The statutes of the Lord are right.” (Ps. 19: 7, 8) Therefore God gives every creature a fair trial or hearing before final judgment is rendered. His judgments are impartial. “Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; . . . for the judgment is God’s.” (Deut. 1:17) God therefore assures every one a fair hearing or trial. “Doth our law judge any man before it hear him, and know what he doeth?”—John 7: 51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">'Judge Christ Jesus</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After the consecration of Jesus, at the time of His baptism in the Jordan, Jehovah God appointed and anointed Him as the great Judge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That means that Jehovah God delegated to His beloved Son the power and authority and jurisdiction to hear and judge all creatures. Jesus Christ was clothed with all power and authority in heaven and in earth at His resurrection. (Matt. 28:18) It is written concerning Him: “For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son.” (John 5: 22) In due time “must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ”. (2 Cor. 5:10) Acting as Jehovah God’s executive officer, Jesus Christ renders judgment in full accord with the will of God. &quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The literal meaning of the word jurisdiction is “the right to say”. It means the right, power and authority to hear and to determine the cause under consideration and to execute the same. Of necessity time enters into the matter because there is a proper or due time to hear and determine causes of action. The fact that Christ Jesus was clothed with power and authority at a specific time does not mean that He would immediately begin to exercise that authority and render judgment. Jehovah God fixes the due time to hear and determine all matters. When the court is set for hearing, that is the proper and due time. Before Jehovah God, the great Supreme Judge, delegates power and authority to others to act as judges, He puts them upon trial and judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since all authority proceeds from Jehovah God, He delegates power and authority to others. This He does only after a trial and judgment of those whom He makes judges. His beloved Son was God’s active agent in the creation of all things. Then He was made flesh, and dwelt amongst men on earth, that He might by His full obedience to God’s law become the Redeemer of man. (John 1:14, 29) At the Jordan He made an agreement to do God’s will, which meant that He must be fully obedient to God’s expressed law. In due time God made a covenant with Jesus that He should be the great Judge and Ruler of all creation. But before the authority was fully and completely conferred upon Jesus He must undergo a trial and be judged and prove worthy. For three and a half years Jesus was subjected to the most severe test, which brought upon Him much suffering. He learned obedience by the things which He suffered. (Heb. 5: 8) He “became obedient unto death, even the [ignominious] death of the cross. 'Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him., and given him a name which is above every name”. (Phil. 2: 8-11) He was tested and proved by Jehovah and was made judge over all creatures, to hear and render judgment in God’s due time. That includes power and authority to judge His associate judges; also to judge the clergy, the nations, the financiers, the politicians, Satan and his organization, and all the peoples, including the living and the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God purposed that Jesus Christ should have associated with Him a small company taken from amongst men, who in due time should participate with Him in judgment. Each one of these must first fully agree to do God’s will, which means consecration; and then each must be put upon trial, and in that trial must prove himself loyal and faithful unto God and to Christ. Jesus said to His disciples that because they had been faithful with Him in His trials they should share with Him in His kingdom, and in His throne or judgment seat.—Luke 22:28-30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To those who agree to be His followers Jesus says: “He that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations.” “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne.” (Rev. 2:26: 3:21) Again, it is written: “Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world?” (1 Cor. 6:3) From the time one becomes a true follower of Christ until his death he is on trial. The final judgment concerning such is rendered by the Lord Jesus Christ when He comes to His temple.—Mal. 3:1-3; 1 Pet. 4:17; Ps. 11:4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God made man for the earth, not for heaven. Only those who are faithful unto death in doing the will of God will be a part of the heavenly kingdom. Jesus said that not every one that says, Lord, Lord, shall enter the kingdom, but “'he that doeth the will of my Father”. (Matt. 7:21) These will be associate judges with Christ in a part of His judgment work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Professed Christians</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The rule of action, or law of the judgment, is written in the Bible, which is God’s Word of truth. All just judgments are rendered in full accord therewith. For this reason the student of the Bible can determine from the Bible what will be the nature of the judgment of the Lord. Jesus Christ renders such decree or judgment, and His followers have something to do therewith. (Ps. 149: 8, 9) The due time for judgment to begin has come, and therefore the person who</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">GOLDEN AGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">is devoted to God can study the matter and get an understanding thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why do I say that the time is here for the judgment of professed Christian people? Approximately at the time of the beginning of the World War God placed His Son Christ Jesus upon His throne, or judgment seat, with direction to begin His great kingdom work. This is clearly shown by Psalm 2:6 and Psalm 110: 1, 2. Within a short time thereafter, to wit, in 1918, and after the casting of Satan out of heaven, Christ the great Judge came to His temple for judgment. In Malachi 3:1-3 it is written: “Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me; and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in : behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts. But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ soap: and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “sons of Levi” here mentioned represent those who have agreed to do the will of God and who must now be tested. In Psalm 11:4 it is written: “The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord’s throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.” This shows that the Lord is in His holy temple for judgment. In 1 Peter 4:17 it is written: “For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall- the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These scriptures show conclusively that the first work of Christ concerning judgment is that of judging those who profess to be His followers. There are millions of people who make this claim. There are thousands of men and women who claim to be leaders, preachers, or teachers of God’s Word, and these are the prominent ones amongst the professed Christian people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When I use the term preacher or clergy I do not mean to show unkindness. No one could occupy a more favored position than that of a real preacher of the Word of God. I apply this term to all who claim to preach the gospel, and then let you judge from the facts and the light of the Scriptures who are included within the faithful and who the unfaithful. All are aware that there is today a. great falling away from the faith and the teachings of the early .Christians. The Bible assigns a reason for this...The purpose for judging the professed Christians now is to make manifest who are really on the side of God and righteousness and give honor to His name. Every good preacher will agree with me that full credit should be given to the Word of God and all honor and glory should he given to God’s name, and that His kingdom is the solution for the ills of humankind. The unfaithful will not agree. The facts applied to the Scriptures will enable you to determine whom you should believe and what is the right course for you to take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The preachers or clergymen claim to have agreed to do God’s will. They claim to be representatives of God and of Christ. Among them there have been some good men and many who have been otherwise. A man is good only when he is entirely devoted to God. God calls those who are truly His sons His “watchmen”. Because the preachers pose before the people and claim that they represent God and that they are His sons, God caused His prophet to write concerning them and ironically to call them watchmen. These men claim to have a knowledge of the truth. They are therefore on trial as preachers or claimed representatives of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The unfaithful preachers have ignored God’s Word and have looked to their own selfish interests. They have used their congregations to further their own desires. They love honor of men and seek their own personal comfort, each one looking to his own congregation for the things that he wants. Concerning such God’s prophet wrote: “His watchmen are blind; they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber. Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand; they all look to their own way, every one for his gain from his quarter.” —Isa. 56:10, 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many of the clergymen or preachers have joined forces with Big Business and professional politicians and have tried to exalt themselves and have lost sight of God’s 'Word. They favor the rich and influential because they reason it will be to their own good. They make the influential men the favored ones of their congregation or the principal ones of their flock. They delight to have the rulers in their chief pews, and they push out the poor and ragged and those without influence for fear that they may offend the rich and that this would work to the clergymen’s disadvantage. They do not really love God, and they serve Him only with their mouths by making speeches of great gravity and assumed piety. Those men have become intoxicated with the teachings of the world, such as evolution, the great achievements of men, and what their church organizations have wrought. Concerning such it is written: “Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink. For the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes: the prophets [preachers] and your rulers, the seers hath he covered. And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed; and the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned. Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men: therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.”—Isa. 29: 9-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many professed Christian leaders, including the clergy, claim to represent God and call themselves “the shepherd of the flock” or congregation which they serve. They do not try to feed the congregation upon the proper Word of God. Their interest is centered in themselves and they feed themselves on the things that please themselves. God likens them unto the shepherd who selfishly neglects his flock. Concerning them He caused their judgment to be written in His Word, as follows: “Thus saith the Lord God unto the shepherds [clergymen], Woe be to the shepherds [preachers] of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds [preachers] feed the flocks? Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock. The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them. And they were scattered because there is no shepherd: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field when they were scattered. My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek after them. Therefore, ye shepherds [preachers], hear the word of the Lord: . . . Behold, I am against the shepherds [clergy]; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds [preachers] feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.”—Ezek. 34: 2, 7, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The preachers have frightened the people by falsely telling them that God would consign them to purgatory for a long while and later transfer them to eternal torment, where they would be tortured forever. They have told the people that each one has a soul that cannot die and, it being in hell torment, that condition of suffering would obtain eternally. They have told them that such is God’s judgment. Such statements are lies, and God calls them such. He says that He did not authorize these men to speak in His name and to represent Him as a fiend, because such a wicked thing as torture was never in God’s mind. (Jer. 32:35) “Then the Lord said unto me, The prophets [preachers] prophesy lies in my name; I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart.” (Jer. 14:14) God has decreed that there will come a time of trouble which will destroy the wicked organizations that oppress the people. The preachers deny this, and the Lord says to them: “Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets [preachers] that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets [clergy] be consumed.”—Jer. 14:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The rich and influential in the church denominations are the “principal” ones of the flock or congregation, and they influence im-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">properly the preacher or shepherd. Those shepherds now enjoy good pasture for themselves. Of course “the principal of the flock” gladly pay the preacher, thinking that by so doing they will receive immunity or absolution from their wrongful acts. Concerning such the Lord decrees: “Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. And the shepherds [preachers] shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape. A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the Lord hath spoiled their pasture.”—Jer. 25: 34-36. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In these days the clergy are the ones who oppose all persons who try to teach the people the plain truth of the Bible. They do not want the people to know the truth, because it would interfere with their wrongful course. During the World War they caused many faithful Christians to be imprisoned and beaten because they were telling the truth. The Lord Jesus calls all His faithful followers His “brethren” and counts them as part of Himself because they are His body members. (Heb. 2:11) Books which explain the Bible, and which enable the people to understand God’s Word of truth, were gathered up by the preachers during the war and since and burned. The preachers strut about assuming great wisdom and warn the people to read nothing that is printed concerning the Bible unless it is endorsed by the clergymen. The Lord gave a parable in which He likened such preachers unto “billy goats” that selfishly abuse those who are in their way. Such men claim to be God’s sons, but they are in fact the children of Satan the Devil. (John 8: 42-44) In the parable Jesus says concerning them: “I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.'Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? Then shall he answer them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these [my brethren], ye did it not to me. And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.”—Matt. 25: 43-46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then Jesus tells of another class of people that will be made manifest in. these days of judgment, and these He calls sheep. He describes them as being kind and considerate to those who go about preaching Christ and His kingdom. The Lord especially blesses the ones who are kind and considerate to those who are humbly teaching the message of His kingdom. Jesus says concerning the preachers or teachers : “By their fruits ye shall know them.” And then He adds: If any one is not bringing forth to the people the fruits of the kingdom he is not the representative of God.’—Matt. 21:43; 7:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">My advice is that if any one comes to your door bringing to you the message of the kingdom of God and showing how God will through Christ establish righteousness and bring peace, health and happiness to the people through His kingdom, you may know that such one represents- the Lord and you should be kind and considerate with him. Respectfully hear what he has to say and then determine whether this is for your good or not. In this day of judgment God is making it to appear clearly who really is faithful to Him and who is not faithful. There are three rules by which you may determine this for yourself: (1) Is the message brought to you one that gives honor and glory to God and Christ and tends to turn the people to the Lord? (2) Is the message supported by the Bible or God’s Word? (3) Is this message calling attention to prophecies now being fulfilled, to enable you to see that the world is in the great transition period?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From the Scriptural proof submitted it is easy to be seen that God has written the judgment in His Word concerning those who have made a covenant with Him and those who claim to serve Him. No man has the right to single out a clergyman and hold him up to personal judgment. God having announced the rule of His judgment and what He will do with those who have been unfaithful, it is the privilege and duty of the student of God’s Word to call attention to these truths and show that it is the time of God’s judgment upon those who claim to serve Him. The reason why there is such a great falling away today from the faith once delivered to the saints; the reason why there are so many professed Christians now repudiating the Bible even though claiming to follow</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Christ; and the reason 'why these are now being brought to the attention of the people, is that the day of God’s judgment is here and His judgment has begun upon certain classes. God is having a house-cleaning first with those who claim to be on His side. There are many nations that claim to be Christian, and these nations God will judge before He begins the judgment of the people in general. Therefore on next Sunday morning consideration will be given to the judgment of the nations, and in this it will be determined from the Scriptures what constitutes a Christian nation and how judgment will be visited upon the nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Thirteen-Month Calendar</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font7">N A recent news item we stated that there are now one hundred organizations in the United States that operate on the thirteen-period or thirteen-month calendar. These months are of twenty-eight days each and begin in each instance with the second day of January and end with the thirty-first of December. We added that it is hoped (by those interested) to put the new calendar in universal use on January 1, 1933, because that day falls on Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In presenting this news item we had no interest in it except as an item of news, but a subscriber who forgot to sign her name or give her address writes us somewhat sharply: “I have been reading some of your articles. Do you think that God is no respecter of days!” &quot;You are attempting to explain prophecy. Seek and ye shall find, that God is a respecter of days (but not of people). Take your stand on the Bible on this point and warn the people of the last day and God will bless you for it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are sorry to have disturbed anybody by this brief item of news. The publication of any news items in our columns has no relation to&quot; any attempted exposition of prophecy unless particularly so stated. We anticipate that the Lord will have something to say about a new calendar in His own due time and way, and probably before many years have passed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Nevertheless, we see no reason to shut our eyes or to keep silent respecting what our fellow men are doing or trying to do.

<p><span class="font7">In ancient times some kings used to put to death any servant who brought them bad news.

<p><span class="font7">The matter, after two years, has finally reached the Public Service Commission at Harrisburg. Nobody expects that they will do anything for the people, for the reason that they never have done anything from the time the commission was first formed. But it is a formality in the la;ying of the burden upon the poor which must be gone through with. It may be necessary eventually to get some judge to consider the whole proceeding, but the people will ve to pay the excess and excessive charges, u here is very little doubt about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is hard to see anything comic in a situation like this, but an incident occurred while the pleadings were taking place at Harrisburg which comes pretty close to it. An attorney for the water gouge was lauding the robbery of the people, showing that it was all quite right, and said :</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“There ought to be a monument raised to the Scranton and Watres families for developing these properties for the people of those valleys.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We trust that nobody will take the attorney seriously, though we have no doubt there' are thousands in the Lackawanna-Wyoming valleys who would look with favor on that monument idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Watres has been lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania. The people are always glad to put men of that type in office. He is also the publisher of the principal paper in the Lacka-wamia-Wyoming valleys and that paper. is a strong believer that no municipality should ever own its own public utilities. Can you guess why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Every big financier who wants to keep 'what he has and to add to it as fast as he can (and they are all that way) either has a newspaper or has a friend who has one. And the newspapers do their stuff, as they are bid to do and paid to do.</span></p>
