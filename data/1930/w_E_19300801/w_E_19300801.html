<h4><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark1"></a>THIS JOURNAL</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">T</span><span class="font4">HIS journal is published for the  purpose of aiding the people to understand Jehovah’s purposes. It provides systematic Bible study in which all its readers may regularly engage. It gives announcement of the  visits made to Bible classes by traveling speakers, announces conventions, and gives reports thereof. It announces radio programs and publishes suitable Bible instruction for broadcasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It adheres strictly to the Bible as God’s revealed Word of Truth. It stands firmly upon the great ransom sacrifice as the  fundamental doctrine by which all doctrines are measured. It is free from parties, sects and creeds of men. It does not assume a dogmatic attitude, but confidently invites a careful examination of its utterances in the  light of the infallible Word of God. It does not indulge in controversies, and its columns are not open to personalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, the Maker of heaven and earth, and is from everlasting to everlasting; that the Logos was the  beginning of his creation; that the Logos became a man; that he is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and in earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT GOD created the earth for man, and created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrongful act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JESUS was made a human being in order that he might become the Redeemer of man; that ho gave his life a sacrifice for man and thereby produced the ransom price; that Jesus the divine was raised from the dead, ascended into heaven, and presented the value of his human sacrifice as the  redemptive price for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT FOR MANY CENTURIES God, through Christ, has been selecting from amongst men the members of his church, which constitutes the body of Christ; that the mission of the  church is to follow in the footsteps of her Lord Christ Jesus, grow in his likeness, give testimony to the name and purpose of Jehovah God, and ultimately be glorified with Christ Jesus in his heavenly kingdom; that Christ, Head and body, constitutes the “seed of Abraham” through which all families of the earth shall be blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE WORLD HAS ENDED; that the  Lord Jesus has returned and is now present; that Jehovah has placed Christ Jesus upon his throne and now commands all nations and peoples to hear and obey him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE HOPE OF THE PEOPLES of earth is restoration to human perfection during the  reign of Christ; that the reign of Christ will afford opportunity to every man to have a fair trial for life, and those who obey will live on earth for ever in a state of happiness.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark10"></a>A GREAT IMAGE</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Thou, 0 king, sanest, and &quot;behold a great image. This great image whose brightness ivas excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible.”—Dan. 2:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PAKT 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH caused his prophet to make a record of and concerning a great image which appeared in a dream to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. Not only that, but he caused his prophet to speak an interpretation of that drcam concerning the image. This alone gives importance to the image and to an understanding thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Image-making is anti-God. In his law which God gave to the Israelites he specifically prohibited the making of an image or the likeness of anything in heaven or on earth. (Ex. 20:4) Concerning those who indulge in image-making it is written: “Cursed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image, an abomination unto the Lord, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and putteth it in a secret place.” —Deut. 27:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> An image is something that represents or is regarded as representing another thing that exists. It is the likeness or imitation of a real thing made to resemble that real or more complete thing. It may well be said to mimic something greater. While Moses was in the mountain to receive the tables of the law at the hand of God the Israelites made a molten image before which they worshiped, which constituted a serious breach of God’s law. (Deut. 9:12) The tendency of images and image worship is to turn the people away from God and turn them to God’s enemy. The real reason, therefore, for God’s forbidding the making of images was and is that the creature should give his entire devotion to his Creator, and not be led into the ways of error.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">* These fixed rules of God, together with the fact that he caused a record to be made in his Word concerning the image that appeared to Nebuchadnezzar, and that he calls it a 'great and terrible’ image, is proof conclusive that the image could not represent God’s purpose, but must have reference to God’s enemy or something in connection with God’s enemy. It is stated in his Word that “I the Lord thy God am a jealous God”, and this statement is made in connection with image-making and image worship. This does not mean that God could be injured by what his creatures might do, but docs mean that his creatures, by turning themselves to God’s enemy and looking at images and not at Jehovah, do violence to their own interests and bring great injury to themselves. Image-making and image worship is therefore an abomination in the sight of God. Why then should God cause record to be made of the great image above mentioned? The expressed purpose of God of and concerning his enemies has direct bearing upon this question and upon the proper understanding of the prophecy uttered by Daniel relative to the image above mentioned.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Jehovah will triumph over his enemies so completely that never will a place be found for them again. The Bible contains an abundance of testimony concerning the enemies of Jehovah. That fact alone proves that it is the purpose of Jehovah to fully advise those who love him of the reason for the existence of these enemies, whence they came, why they have opposed him, why he has permitted them to continue so long, what provision he has made for their destruction, and when they will be destroyed. We know that the power of the Almighty God has no limitations and if he should will to do so he could snuff out all his enemies in an instant. The fact that he has not done so long ago shows that he has good reason for not doing it until a time certain. That it may be fully understood that he will destroy them completely in his own good time it is important to consider a few of the Bible texts upon this point: “But thou, Lord, art most high for evermore. For, lo, thine enemies, O Lord, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish: all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.” (Ps. 92:8,9) “Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off.” (Mie. 5:9) “Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.” (Ps. 21:8) “But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away. But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.”—Ps. 37:20,38.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> Jehovah’s purpose to destroy his enemies has been expressed from the very beginning of man’s sinful course. The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent’s head.—Gen. 3:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> That declaration was made more than six thousand years ago. The final bruising has not yet taken place. To Abraham Jehovah said: “Thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies.” (Gen. 22:17) Here Abraham represented Jehovah himself, while the “seed” promised stands for or represents the instrument Jehovah will use to destroy his enemies. Jehovah caused Jacob to prophesy concerning Judah in these words: “Judah, . . . thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies.” (Gen. 49:8) “The Lion of the tribe of Juda” will be the One who thus performs the work here prophesied.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> God’s chosen people in Canaan were led by Joshua, When he had captured the enemy kings and held them in custody he caused his men to draw near and put their feet on the necks of these kings, and then they killed them. “And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the Lord do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.”—Josh. 10:25.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">* God’s prophet, concerning the enemies of Jehovah and the enemies of those who love him, wrote: “For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul. He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth. ” (Ps. 54: 3-5) “Through God we shall do valiantly; for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.” (Ps. 60:12) The prayer of the righteous is: “Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him. As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth before the fire, so lot the wicked perish at the presence of God. But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.”— Ps. 68:1,2,21.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> Jehovah has made his beloved Son Christ Jesus his Chief Executive Officer for ever. By him he will accomplish his purposes. He is the right hand instrument of Jehovah. Christ Jesus is the “seed” that shall bruise the head of the enemy. Christ was not permitted even to begin this work of destruction until God’s due time, but when that time arrived God sent him forth upon a mission, and the work is now in progress. (Ps. 110:1,2) The beginning of his reign in 1914 marks the beginning of the great King’s work and he must go forward from that time until it is completed: “The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath. He shall judge among the [nations], he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.” (Ps. 110: 5, 6) The great work God gives unto the hand of Christ, which includes the faithful members of his body. Concerning such it is written:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> “Give the king thy judgments, 0 God, and thy righteousness unto the king’s son. He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment. He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth. They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.” (Ps. 72:1,2,8,9) “Th© Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof. A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about.” (Ps. 97:1,3) “Let there be none to extend mercy unto him; neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children. Let his posterity be cut off: and in the generation following let their name be blotted out. ’ ’—Ps. 109:12,13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> The above are a few of the Scriptural texts proving God’s purpose to completely destroy his enemies, and to do so by and through his beloved Son. We are now approaching that great battle of the day of God Almighty and it seems quite clear that God’s duo time has come for us to have a better understanding of the prophecies and that this includes an understanding of the great and terrible image mentioned in Daniel’s prophecy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">‘TERRIBLE IMAGE*</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, he had a dream that troubled him. He forgot the dream, and he being unable to remember it, his magicians and astrologers, of course, could not interpret it; and they used this fact as an excuse for their inability to interpret the dream. Daniel was then a captive in Babylon, where the Israelites had been taken. Together with some of his brethren he sought the face of the Lord in prayer and then asked permission to disclose to Nebuchadnezzar both his drcam and the interpretation thereof. Daniel was then brought before Nebuchadnezzar the king, and told him his dream. Be it noted that Daniel laid no claim whatsoever to any personal ability or learning by which he could recall the drcam or give the interpretation thereof; but when he was brought to tell Nebuchadnezzar he informed the king that his information came from the God of heaven. Daniel said to the king: “But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.”—Dan. 2: 30.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> Daniel was devoted to Jehovah and was much beloved by Jehovah and was used by the Most High to write down the prophecy, which would be fulfilled in God’s due time. Daniel represented that class of people who would be on earth and who would be fully devoted to God at the end of the world when ‘Michael shall stand up’. Daniel therefore specifically represented the faithful remnant, those who are anointed of the Lord God to do his work. The record of the dream and the interpretation given by Daniel the prophet follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> ‘ ‘ Thou, 0 king, sawest, and behold, a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible. This image’s head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, his legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay. Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces. Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup>“This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king. Thou, 0 king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory. And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold. And after thee' shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth. And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh, all these shall it break in pieces and bruise. And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part, of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken. And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men • but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1T</sup>“And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever. Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.’’—Dan. 2:31-45.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> For many years those who have loved God have sought for an understanding of the prophecies, and particularly those written by Daniel and Ezekiel. God has never been displeased with this effort, as is indicated by the Scriptures; nor should it be expected that God will permit the true understanding of these prophecies to be had until his due time. The holy men of old who prophesied concerning God’s purpose of the salvation of the human race sought diligently to understand the meaning of what they wrote down. Even the angels desired to look into the meaning thereof and have an understanding of it. God did not express his displeasure because of the efforts thus made to understand, but it was not his due time to make his secrets known. Nor would it be at all improper for anyone who is devoted to God to diligently seek to know the understanding of his Word at any or all times. This observation is here made to emphasize the fact that only in God’s due time can a prophecy be understood by men.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> More than fifty years ago some good, honest Christian people who were called Adventists published an interpretation of the foregoing prophecy of Daniel which in substance states that the terrible image that Daniel saw represented the successive world powers, to wit, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece and Rome; that the golden head of the image represented Babylon, the breast of silver represented or pictured the Medo-Persian empire; that the copper (mistranslated brass) pictured the Grecian world power; and the legs of iron pictured the Pagan Roman world power; and the feet composed of iron and clay pictured Papal Rome or what is otherwise called the “Holy Roman Empire”. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> publications, having no better explanation, practically adopted the foregoing interpretation. There are some good reasons why the above interpretation of the prophecy is not correct, and these are, to wit:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> (1) That the true meaning of the terrible image could not be understood by any of those whom Daniel represented until after the coming of the Lord to his temple. The foregoing interpretation having been made long before the coming of the Lord to his temple, it is hardly likely that it would be correct. That would not mean that any criticism is leveled against any of those who thus interpreted it. Without doubt God was pleased with them because they sought the truth. Daniel's prophecy says: “This secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation.” And furthermore that ‘the God of heaven revealeth secrets of what shall be in the latter days’. (Dan. 2:28,30) These “latter days” must refer to the “day of the Lord”, which means the time beginning when God places his King upon his holy hill in Zion. (Ps. 2; G) That event occurred in 1914, and surely then the understanding could not be had until after that time. It was after the Lord came to his temple in 1918 that his anointed people began to have a better understanding of the prophecies, because the temple in heaven was opened. (Rev. 11:19) Since Daniel says that the vision or prophecy is to make known what is to come to pass in the “latter days”, then it must be that God purposed that his people, whom Daniel represented, would be given an understanding of the image in the “latter days”, and not before.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> (2) That the prophecy shows that the terrible image would be broken in pieces all at one and the same time and it follows that unless the entire image is in existence at one and the same time this could not take place. The world powers of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Pagan Rome, have ceased to exist and the image has not yet been broken in pieces. The “holy Roman empire” does not now exist as a world power.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> (3) It could not be literally true that Nebuchadnezzar at the time he was king of Babylon was ruler over all “the beasts of the field, and the fowls of the heaven”, as the prophecy states. There is no proof that he had any more power or control over the wild beasts and the birds than any other imperfect man had.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> (4) There is no evidence whatsoever that Medo-Persia as a world power possessed anything peculiar that could be symbolized by the precious metal silver, or that the Grecian empire was in any particular way marked so that it could be symbolized by the less valuable metal brass or copper.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>24</sup> (5) It is not true that Rome was the first world power to employ the iron military rule that ‘bruises the peoples of the earth’. Egypt existed long before the day of Rome, and Egypt was the first great military power. The world power of Assyria was before Babylon or Rome, and Assyria boasted that her armies had conquered all the nations and none had been able to stand before her military onslaughts. Only Jehovah by his angel could and did deliver the Israelites from the Assyrian iron or military hand. (Isa. 36:17-20) Greece conquered and ruled the world by military force, and it is said of her mighty warrior general that “he wept because there were no more worlds to conquer”. In much earlier days than that, even, the kings of Canaan had military equipment and nine hundred chariots made of iron. (Judg. 4:3) Other nations fought with military instruments of iron long before Rome existed. (1 Ki. 22:11) Other reasons appear why ‘the terrible image’ does not refer to world powers, and these will be considered as we progress.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>25</sup> The image about which Nebuchadnezzar dreamed was a terrible one. What could it picture ? In order to enable the student to follow the argument here set forth it is now here briefly stated that the terrible image represented Satan’s organization, both visible and invisible. Before submitting the proof in support of that conclusion consideration is first given to some Scriptural evidence concerning the greater organization.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> Jehovah has a universal organization which is often mentioned in the Scriptures under the symbol of “mountain”. “So he brought them into his own holy bounds, the mountain-range which his right hand acquired.” (Ps. 78: 54, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham)</span><span class="font5"> “Great and highly to be praised in the city is our God, his holy mountain is beautiful for elevation, the joy of all the earth. Mount Zion on the northern ridge is the city of a king.” (Ps. 48:1,2, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham)</span><span class="font5"> (See also Isaiah 2:2; 11:9; 56:7; Joel 3:17; Zechariah 8:3.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>27</sup> Ezekiel was caused to write down his vision of God’s organization. (Ezek. 1: 3-28) In that vision he describes four living creatures having the likeness of a man, and every one had four faces and four wings. ‘ ‘ Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward. As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle. Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies. And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went. As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.”—Ezek. 1:9-13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> There appeared in the vision also one wheel upon the earth by each of the living creatures which had four faces. “And their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.” Further describing what he saw, Ezekiel said: “When they went, they went upon their four sides; and they turned not when they went. And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.”—Ezek. 1:17,19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>29</sup> There appeared over the heads of the living creatures a great expanse like terrible crystal to look upon. Under the expanse were the wings of the living creatures each having four wings, two on each side of the body. When these creatures went the sound of the wings was like the sound of many waters. “And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings. And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.”—Ezek. 1: 24, 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> Above the expanse or firmament was the likeness of a great throne having the appearance of a sapphire stone, and upon the throne was one having the appearance of a man. There was the appearance of fire round about and within it, and the color was of amber. After describing the appearance of the one on the throne, then the prophecy adds: “As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord.” (Ezek. 1:28) Thus it is seen that the prophetic description is that fitly representing a mighty war chariot, therefore picturing a chariot-like organization extending high above the earth into heaven, and this mighty organization is presided over by Jehovah the Most High.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>31</sup> The Chief Executive Officer in that great organization is the beloved Son of God, whom he has made Ruler over the world. With him is his perfect organization “the holy city”, which forms a part of the universal organization. In that organization are cherubim, seraphim and a host of angels, and the members of the body of Christ, these all possessing authority and power as granted by Jehovah. (Isa. 6: 2, 3; Rev. 4; 6; 1 Pet. 3:22; Heb. 12:22) Mention is here made of this mighty organization of Jehovah that the student may have in mind the mimic god who has attempted to make the organization in the likeness thereof.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">LUCIFER’S ORGANIZATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>32</sup> God created man in his own image and put him on the earth. He put man in the garden of Eden to dress and keep it. (Gen. 1:28; 2:15) God thereby made the perfect man a part of his great organization and commanded that man should remain always in harmony with his Creator and his fixed laws. The beginning of God’s creation was his beloved Son the Logos, and thereafter all things created were created by the Logos as the deputy of Jehovah God. (John 1:1-3) That there are various divisions of God’s universal organization is certain, as appears from the words which follow: “For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: and he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the pre-eminence. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwelt”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>33</sup> This establishes beyond a question of doubt that in God’s organization there are thrones, dominions, principalities, angels and servants. One of the titles given to the mighty Chief Deputy of Jehovah is the “bright and morning star”, which also means prince. There was another star in God’s universal organization. It is recorded that when God laid the foundation of the earth as a home for man “the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy”. (Job 38:7) That other star or prince was Lucifer, and the proof concerning that is quite certain and clear.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>34</sup> Lucifer was appointed to a high office in God’s organization. “Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so; thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.” (Ezek. 28:14) “Anointed” means that he was designated to fill a certain office. The word “covereth” used in this text means one who provides protection, defense or supervision as an overseer. Lucifer was in Eden, the garden of God, where Adam was put, and Lucifer being made an officer in Jehovah’s organization, it seems clear that man was under the special supervision of Lucifer and the perfect man was therefore a part of Lucifer’s organization and in the great organization of Jehovah. Since Ezekiel’s prophecy shows that God’s organization is like a wheel within a wheel, then it may well be said that Lucifer’s part of the organization was one of the wheels in the greater wheel. This, of course, applies when he was in harmony with Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>33</sup> Lucifer was made glorious and beautiful to look upon when he appeared in Eden. ‘ ‘ Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.” (Ezek. 28:13) He was therefore a light-bearer and clothed with power and authority.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> The tree is a symbol of a living creature, and when planted by the Lord Jehovah it is a tree of righteousness or creature of righteousness as long as remaining in harmony with Jehovah. (Isa. 61:3; Ps. 1:1-3; Prov. 11:30; Num. 24:6; Judg. 9:8; Ps. 104:16) It appears certain from the language used that God’s prophet referred to Lucifer when he wrote these words: ‘ ‘ Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters. The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his branches: nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty. I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him.” (Ezek. 31:7-9) This shows that Lucifer had other spirit creatures in his organization, and over which he ranked as superior. As a superior officer in God’s organization certain specific duties devolved upon him, and man was under Lucifer’s direct supervision. Being above others of his organization he would be properly referred to as the head thereof.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3T</sup> God created the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air and brought them before Adam and caused him to give each one a name, and they were subject to Adam. (Gen. 1:28; 2:19,20) Since Lucifer was overlord of Adam it follows that all these beasts of the field and fowls of the air'were under his superior supervision. The further description by the prophet concerning Lucifer’s organization is this: ‘ ‘ Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth. All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations.” (Ezek. 31:5,6) Compare this language at this point with Daniel 2:38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">METALS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>88</sup> The image described by Daniel in the prophecy mentions three precious metals, to wit, gold and silver, and copper, which is mistranslated “brass”. It mentions one base metal “iron”. The meaning of these metals is significant, otherwise the Lord would not have them in his Word in connection with this image. Gold is first mentioned in the Bible as being in the land of Havilah, which land was watered by one of the heads of the rivers that flowed out of Eden. (Gen. 2:11,12) The Most Holy, both of the tabernacle and of the temple, was overlaid with fine gold. The cherubs in the Most Holy were made of gold. (Ex. 25:17-19; 1 Ki. 6:22-28) The tabernacle and temple pictured God’s organization. Gold is symbolic of things divine. The saints of Zion are comparable to fine gold. (Lam. 4;2) Silver is a precious metal and was used in connection with the tabernacle and temple service. (Ex. 26:19) The platters, bowls and other utensils used in that service were made of silver. (Num. 7:13; 1 Chron. 28:17) Silver is next in order in value as compared with gold, but of course of less value than gold. It is mentioned as second in the terrible image.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> Copper is another precious metal, but of less value than silver. Brass, as we know, is a combination of metals. The word “brass”, appearing in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version,</span><span class="font5"> is a mistranslation, and should be “copper”. Copper was used in connection with the tabernacle and the temple. (Ex. 38:3) Gold, silver and copper are classed as “noble” metals and have their relative value as in the order named. The description of Lucifer when he was in Eden, as given by the prophet, shows that he was covered with gold and precious stones which God gave to him when he was created or when installed in office.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ENEMY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>40</sup> Lucifer was undoubtedly the most beautiful in appearance of all creatures in his immediate organization which God had provided for him. He had much; but he coveted more, and by reason thereof he became the great enemy of God. (Jcr. 51:13) Being made perfect and beautiful and being given a commission of great authority he was duty-bound to be wholly loyal to God. “Iniquity” means lawlessness or that which is contrary to law, and the record shows that Lucifer became lawless, and from that time he was God’s enemy. “Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.” (Ezek. 28:15) From that day until now he has been interfering -with God’s organization, and Jesus is authority for the statement that he is The Enemy.—Matt. 13: 25-38,41.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>41</sup> When Lucifer rebelled against God and started on his course of lawlessness or wickedness God changed his name, or gave him different names, and one of these names is Satan, which means opposer or adversary. This signifies that he is the enemy of God and that he resists everything that God docs. (Zech. 3:1,2) It was Satan that tried to turn Job against God. He induced Judas to betray Christ Jesus. (Job 1: 6-12; Luke 22:3) He also got control of the clergy of Jesus’ time and dragged them into his great conspiracy to murder the Holy One.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>42</sup> Serpent is another name that Lucifer has had since his rebellion and which signifies that he is the arch deceiver. He has deceived almost all the human race. His deceptions have been so complete that only God’s ‘elect servant’ class amongst men are able to resist him, and these do so only by the grace of God. —Matt. 24:24; Ps. 91:2-11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>43</sup> At the present time Satan has induced almost all people to believe that no such a thing as the Devil is existing but that all talk about the Devil is a myth. By reason of this deception he is able to use them more to his purposes. Even among the children of God fully consecrated to do his will, until recent years many thought that Satan the Devil had been bound and restrained for some time. Not until 1924 was it made clear from the Scriptural evidence that Satan is not bound, and it was after that date that Satan’s mighty organization was first recognized by God’s faithful people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>44</sup> Today there are many people on earth who have made a consecration to do God’s will who do not discern Satan’s organization even now. Satan is the great enemy. His organization is made up of God’s enemies, and the scriptures heretofore set forth show beyond any question of doubt that in God’s due time the enemy shall be destroyed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">UNDERSTANDING</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">*<sup>5</sup> When the Lord came to his temple in 1918 greater light began to shine into the mind of each one of his devoted ones who have been brought into the temple. It was about 1925 that the faithful discerned the fact that the kingdom had begun and that Satan had been cast out of heaven and now must confine his operations to the earth. The two great signs or wonders in heaven appeared unto them and were then understood by God’s people for the first time.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>46</sup> It therefore seems to be impossible that even the anointed of the Lord could have had a proper conception of the ‘terrible image’ of Daniel until after the coming of the Lord to his temple. Furthermore, the Scriptures positively state that greater light shines upon God’s people at the end of the world and that these things in the Bible were written aforetime for the special benefit, comfort and encouragement of those continuing faithful upon the earth at the end of the world. (1 Cor. 10:11; Rom. 15:4) In the light of the foregoing indisputable truths let the examination be made of the text of Daniel’s prophecy concerning the ‘terrible image’.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>47</sup> At once it is apparent to the anointed of the Lord at this time that the ‘great and terrible image’ herein considered represents far more than merely earthly corporations or earthly governments.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark12"></a>WORLD-WIDE PEACE: WHEN?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">[Fifteen-minute radio lecture]</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font5">HE majority of people desire and love peace. If the question could be submitted to a vote of the people, there would never be a war. People with honest hearts, who love their fellow men, and who love righteousness and justice, abhor war. It is always the minority that forces war on the people. General W. T. Sherman, of the Civil War, said, “War is hell.’’ That opinion has been confirmed a million times by those who participated in the recent World War. Besides the millions of dead and the other millions of cruelly maimed, the great World War taught people how to profiteer, lie, steal, swear and smoke; it filled the world with millions of people who have no regard for decency, law, or the rights and liberties of others; it filled the world with unmentionable crimes and diseases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So terrible were the results of that war that almost superhuman efforts have been made ever since to bring about a condition of world peace. However, all these efforts have been made along wrong lines and by people who do not want peace. When conventions are held for the purpose of promoting peace, the delegates are always the militarists, whose business is war, or the great industrialists, who profit by the same. Peacefully inclined men and women, known as pacifists, are never chosen as delegates. The advice of the masses of the people, who furnish the soldiers and foot the bills, is never sought. Thus it is that those who attend peace conferences are controlled by selfish interests, and instead of peace being promoted, ill will, distrust, hatred, wrangling and further war preparations arc the usual outcome. The people have lost all confidence in their leaders and have no hope from that quarter. The only hope held out to the poor, oppressed people is that peace lies only in preparedness, which means a competition among the nations as to which can build the most battleships and the most bombing planes and make the most poison gas and other weapons of destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus the burden of taxes increases every year, as does also the number of boodlers and grafters. Into this great vortex of militarism the people arc forced to cast their billions of taxes, with no other result than that boodlers and grafters multiply, scandals in high places abound, and national fear and distrust increases. As a result a great cry of protest is going up from the people. This protest is in the form of labor organizations, socialism, communism, bolshevism and general anarchy, and these are looked upon with fear by the people, and in many quarters are regarded as an even worse menace than militarism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Describing this same condition, which he foresaw would exist at this time, Jesus uttered these prophetic words: “Upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; . . . men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth. ’ ’—Luke 21: 25, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The question arises, Will peace ever come? Is deliverance from the present almost intolerable conditions of suffering and fear a possibility ? If so, how ? and when? The answer to these questions is found nowhere except in the Bible. Not realizing this fact, the people are looking to their leaders for an answer. Some are hoping against hope that preparedness will bring about peace; others are likewise hoping that the peace conferences will lead to a gradual disarmament, and that deliverance will come in that way; others are hoping that the whole world will vote the socialists into power, or the communists, or the bolshevists, and that these will reform the body politic. These hopes are vain. Peace will never come from any of these sources. Men cannot bring about peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But peace is coming, and it lies in the very near future. The author and promoter of wars and confusion on the earth is Satan, and as long as he is unrestrained there will be no peace. Peace, justice, truth, righteousness and happiness belong to God’s kingdom. Wars, confusion, unrighteousness, oppression and unhappiness pertain to Satan’s kingdom. Few people realize that Satan is “the god of this world”. This means that Satan rules the world. He controls the people by using selfish men as his tools. Through these selfish men he deceives the world into believing that the hope of deliverance is in “preparedness”, “peace conferences,” “church union,” “leagues of nations,” or else in “socialism” or communistic governments of some kind. These schemes are deceptions put forth by Satan to divert the minds of the people from the one and only hope of deliverance set forth in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan began his deceptions in Eden, first with Eve and later with Adam. Having diverted them from the service of God, he set about to organize their posterity into selfish institutions, for the very purpose of using these selfish institutions to blind people to the purpose of Jehovah God. But what is God’s purpose? It is this. When Satan led Adam and Eve into sin and brought the curse of sin and death on the race, God determined to deliver the race from this curse and also to deliver them from the power of Satan and his deceptions. He purposed to accomplish this deliverance by and through his Son, and he foreordained that the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">time of</span><span class="font5"> the deliverance would be at the second advent of Jesus, and during the thousand-year reign of Christ which </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">begins</span><span class="font5"> at his second advent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This thousand-year reign is called “the kingdom of God”, and is what Jesus referred to when he taught his followers to pray, saying: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” Since God has ordained that Jesus shall bring peace into the earth, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">he</span><span class="font5"> is referred to as the “Prince of Peace” and the “Prince of life”. In Isaiah 9:6,7, we read of this wonderful Prince, as follows: “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font5"> government and peace there shall be no end.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nearly nineteen hundred years ago, when Jesus was on earth, Satan’s representatives, who were the religious leaders of that day, called him “Beelzebub the prince of the devils”. Those Pharisees were the willing tools of Satan. By exposing their shams, hypocrisies and false teachings, Jesus was bringing a blessing to the people. No wonder Satan used them to call Jesus the prince of devils. Peter accused those hypocrites to their face and charged them with the murder of Jesus. His words are found in Acts 3:14,15 and read: “Ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you; and killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead.” Again, in Acts 5:30,31 this same Peter renewed his charge against those hypocritical religionists, saying: “The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree. Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Peace is coming to the world through this highly exalted Jesus, “the Prince of Peace,” “the Prince of life,” the “Saviour” of the world. His thousandyear kingdom will be the “desire of all nations”. This kingdom is the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font5"> hope of the world. Over and over, the Scriptures exhort the Lord’s people to “wait for his Son from heaven”; and to ‘patient waiting for the kingdom’. We do well to note some of those texts. In Luke 23:51 we read of Joseph of Arimathrea as follows: “Who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.” In 1 Corinthians 1: 7 we read: “So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” Again, in 1 Thessalonians 1:10 we are exhorted to “wait for his Son from heaven”, and in 2 Thessalonians 3:5 are these words: “The Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.” Speaking of this period of waiting, Daniel, in chapter 12, verse 12, says: “Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred five and thirty days. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yes, a blessing comes at the end of this waiting period. At that time Christ will be in power. As the great General of Jehovah, he will assume command of Jehovah’s army and begin action against Satan. His forces will make an assault against the forces of Satan. That battle will be short and decisive, and Christ will be the victor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That victory will mean the destruction of Satan’s organization on earth, and will result in the binding of Satan for a thousand years so that he will deceive the nations no more till the thousand years are ended. (Rev. 20:1-3) That victory will mean the deliverance of the people from Satan and his oppressive and deceptive institutions; it will end all fraud, hypocrisy, injustice and unrighteousness; that victory will witness the establishment of a permanent and everlasting peace on earth, and good will toward men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Peace can never be established by human effort. While men recognize its necessity and will put forth efforts to establish it, yet the Scriptures tell us that their efforts will be futile, and the reason is that selfishness governs their every effort and controls their every act. In Jeremiah 6:13,14 we read of this selfishness as follows: “For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. They have healed also the hurt of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace: when there is no peace.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures assure us that when earth’s wise men are talking about peace, and making efforts to that end, conditions will continue to go from bad to worse, and finally culminate in what men call “the battle of Armageddon”. In 1 Thessalonians 5: 3 Paul says: “For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape. ’ ’ Thus the apostle tells us that man’s efforts to establish peace in the earth are doomed to failure. The sudden destruction foretold in this text is about to overtake them. “The battle of that great day of God Almighty” will soon occur. Satan will soon be bound, and his power to blind and deceive be fully restrained for a thousand years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The Prince of Peace” is now on the throne, and the announcement of this fact is going out all over- the earth. Multitudes of people have heard this announcement, and hope is springing up in their hearts. The time is near at hand when the words of the prophet will be fulfilled as recorded in Psalm 85:10,11, which read: “Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other. Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark14"></a>THE DESTINY OF MAN</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">[Fifteen-minute radio lecture]</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font5">HERE shall I spend eternity? Nearly every human creature has to face this question at some time in life. Those who die in infancy escape its consideration, and some who are suddenly swept out of existence by accident or calamity have never given it proper thought. In the excitement of youth, the young do not pause to consider; in the busy activities of manhood’s and womanhood’s estate the subject is pushed aside, because it is an unpleasant one, and the necessary daily duties are allowed to submerge it; but when life’s span is measured by a few hours, or days, or weeks, or months, it becomes a subject for solemn consideration. Then there are some who have dragged out long years in almost daily expectation of death, who have had the subject forced upon their attention for all those weary years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With the majority of people the plunge into eternity is taken without any very definite hope. At home and in Sunday school, they were taught that those who are reasonably good will somehow manage to get to heaven, while those who aro vile and degraded will spend eternity in a place of torment. These teachings are accepted because they are taught in the creeds and by religious leaders. Notwithstanding these facts, when faced by death there is usually doubt, foreboding and dread, due to the fact that the dying one is not sure that the creeds and the religious leaders are right in their teachings. He realizes that these teachings have never been </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">proven to</span><span class="font5"> be correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus it occurs that with the majority of people the exit from this life is accomplished with uncertainty as to whether they will spend eternity in heaven in indescribable bliss, or in hell in indescribable agony. The exceptions to this rule are a few people who have convinced themselves that they are so far above 'the common herd’ that they are </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">sure of</span><span class="font5"> a place in bliss. They have convinced themselves that they are </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">deserving</span><span class="font5"> of God’s best gift, and that heaven’s portals will swing wide open to them and that they will be welcomed with glad acclaim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fact that persons are </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">sure</span><span class="font5"> they arc going to heaven does not prove a thing about the existence of such a place or about the existence of a hell of torment. The devout Buddhist, Confucianist and Indian will die in all complacency, secure in their fanatical belief that they are to be changed into another form of life or go to their happy hunting ground at the moment of death. This serenity in death, however, does </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font5"> prove that their beliefs are right, and all believers in the Bible </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">know</span><span class="font5"> that those beliefs are wrong. Just so the fact that some one professing to be a Christian dies in calmness, serenity, and confidence that he is fit for heaven is no proof that he will go there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The only place that satisfactory proof can be found is in the Bible. Any faith that is not founded on the Bible is unstable, unreliable and invariably untrue. If anyone wishes to know definitely what is the destiny of man he can go to the Bible with honest heart and reverent mind and get full information. It is not necessary to delve into science, nor to try to get in touch with the dead. Neither is it necessary to consult spirit mediums, nor the opinions of so-called great men who have lived and died in the past. All these sources of information are useless, and even worse than useless, because the information given is invariably false and misleading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God is the Creator of all life, and the Giver of every blessing that men possess. More than that, he is the one who shall decide what man’s destiny shall be. He inspired holy men to write the Bible, which contains the information; and for his creatures to disregard his Word and seek information from other sources manifests a disrespect and lack of reverence for him which cannot be otherwise than displeasing to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the Bible each member of the human race will spend eternity in one of three places; namely, in heaven, on the earth, or in everlasting destruction (called second death). According to the Bible no one will spend eternity in eternal torment; neither will all the saved be in heaven. Of course this statement will not be regarded as “orthodox”, but we must bear in mind that “orthodox” beliefs are the teachings of men, and not of the Bible. If one believes the Bible he will invariably be considered “unorthodox”. The wonder is that men can be found who possess so much self-esteem that they dare set up their opinions in opposition to the teachings of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When God created Adam he told him to multiply and increase and replenish the earth, and have dominion over the earth and over the birds, beasts and fish. It should be noted that God did not tell Adam that he would ever go to heaven. His home was to be the earth, and he was told that if he disobeyed he would surely die. After his disobedience God told him that he would return to dust again, and he was driven out of the garden; but not one word was Adam told about his going to eternal torment. Eternal torment is one of the “orthodox” teachings of men, but is not taught in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Adam’s one sin brought the condemnation of death upon himself and all his posterity. God has purposed to deliver the race from this condemnation and to restore to them what Adam lost. To accomplish this purpose God sent Jesus into the earth to die for the race to redeem them from death, so that they could be restored to life again by a resurrection of the dead. Therefore it is written: “The Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.” (1 John 4:14) Jesus said: “The Son of man came ... to give his life a ransom for many.” Again he said: “The Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.” Since Adam lost only an earthly home and estate, not a heavenly one, it follows that that is what will be restored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work of resurrecting and restoring the race to perfect life right here on the earth will be accomplished by the resurrected and glorified Jesus during his thousand-year reign, which is just now beginning, and which will be in full operation as soon as the present evil world is destroyed in the battle of Armageddon, which is just ahead of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After this battle, which will destroy Satan’s wicked empire which now cumbers the earth, and incidentally destroy all orthodox teachings of men, the resurrection of the dead will follow. All will then be </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">properly </span><span class="font5">instructed as to what God’s will is; all will be required to obey that will or else be destroyed in the second death. The obedient ones will live on the earth forever. That will be </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">their destiny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In proof, the following texts are cited. In Psalm 37: 29 we read: “The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.” In violent contrast with this text the clergy have taught that all the righteous will go to heaven. Again, in Isaiah 60:21 we read: “Thy people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the land for ever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The clergy say the earth is to be destroyed; but in Ecclesiastes 1: 4 we read that “the earth abideth forever ”, Of course, if men are to live on the earth forever it will not be destroyed. In Jesus’ prayer he taught us to pray for the time when God’s will would be done on earth as it is done in heaven. And all the prophets and apostles tell us of a time when the knowledge of Jehovah will fill the earth as the waters cover the deep. They tell us of a time when every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess to the glory of God, both of things in heaven and things in earth. Scores of texts tell us that men are destined to live on earth forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Jesus was on earth, he began to preach a new message which was never heard before his time, and that message was, ‘ ‘ The kingdom of heaven is at hand. ’ ’ He chose his disciples and sent them out to preach that same message. This message means that from that time on God has been selecting from the race a class composed of 144,000 persons, who must be faithful unto death; they must follow in his steps. These must learn obedience through suffering, as Jesus did. To all of this class is promised the first resurrection, and that they will reign with Jesus during that thousand years. Their destiny will be a heavenly one. They will be like Jesus and see him as he is. Revelation 20: 6 says of these: “Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the first resurrection shall bring them together in heaven as a divine, immortal, invisible company, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">their destiny</span><span class="font5"> will be to be with the Lord forever. They, together with Jesus as their Head, will be the kingdom, while the earth full of human creatures will be the subjects of the kingdom. Tliis heavenly class is called “the church”, also “the bride, the Lamb’s wife”. They are called “the elect”, “the overeomers,” and are referred to as “joint-heirs with Christ”. Speaking to this class, Jesus said: ‘I appoint unto you a kingdom even as my Father hath appointed unto me.’ (Luke 22:29) Again, Jesus said to these: “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures describe another class, who will be unfaithful, stubborn and rebellious; who will resist the mercy and favor of God, and who will continue this rebellion and resistance until God cuts them off from all life in the second death. That will be </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">their destiny.</span><span class="font5"> The second death is called “everlasting destruction”, in 2 Thessalonians 1:9, which reads: “Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.” This is the class to whom Jesus referred when he said: “These shall go away into everlasting punishment. ’ ’ He did not say that they would go away into everlasting torment, as the clerg,y have taught. He simply says that they will go into everlasting punishment, and the Scriptures show that the punishment is to be death, second death, or everlasting destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Over and over we are told that all the wicked will God destroy; that they will perish like the beasts of the field, and that they will be as though they had not been, that is, as though they never had an existence. This class will be composed of all who have come to a knowledge of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">truth</span><span class="font5"> and then take their stand against it</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus we see the destiny of the entire human family, according to the purpose of God as shown in his Word.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">(1) A small portion of the race will attain to heavenly glory and be associated with Jesus in the kingdom and in the kingdom work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(2) The vast majority of the race will come back on the earth again and be privileged to enjoy everlasting life here on earth if they obey the laws of the kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(3) A relatively small number will be destroyed for ever as rebels against God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Thank God no human creature is destined to spend eternity is agonizing torment as the clergy have selfishly taught!</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark16"></a>FORMALISM</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">HE following extract from a letter received by </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> is the reason for writing these lines:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I have been wanting to write about a question that looks aa though it were small but seems to bo of growing importance. Some of the friends think that it is formalism to kneel in prayer at prayer meeting. At first I thought it was all right if they felt that way, but the idea is spreading; even E---- thought she would not kneel any longer. The one</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">who started it I think refuses to close his eyes or fold his hands—also formalism. This family has children. I’m leading the children’s class; the children acted as the parents; so I gave a little talk about it, saying that ‘they did not act toward their teacher as toward each other, nor toward the principal as toward the teacher; so wo should remember Jehovah is the very highest of all. Then I said we folded our hands as a sign of our helplessness without Him, and closed our eyes so that we have less to attract our attention and keep us from lifting up our hearts together to God’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The policy of Satan invariably is to induce men to take an extreme course. The Pharisees were extremists in their formalism, and delighted to stand on the street corners and pray, that they might be seen of men. The motive inducing them thus to do was bad,</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark18"></a>IN PRAYER</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">and Jesus denounced them for that reason. Likewise, any formalism practiced for the purpose of attracting attention to the performer is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The other extreme is to be brazen and flippant in one’s attitude, which shows an entire lack of reverence for God. It is written, “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” The wise man continues in that, proper attitude of fear before God. If any man comes to the point that he has no fear of displeasing God, then he is in a bad way and his prayers would avail little or nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The deportment of a Christian should be in keeping with his proper relationship to God. He will realize that the creature is not as much as the small dust in the balance when compared with the great Creator. His helplessness and complete dependence upon the Lord God is ever before him. As his knowledge of the loving-kindness of God increases he has a greater desire to worship Jehovah, and a greater measure of devotion to him. He delights to put himself in the proper physical attitude showing his dependence upon Jehovah. His motive then in so doing is entirely unselfish. He thus naturally assumes that attitude which best befits his relationship to God. If alone, he delights to bow down in silent prayer. If with his brethren, he will be glad to kneel with them in prayer, that all may show their dependence upon and devotion to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the company is large and one leads in prayer, it may be found to be to the best interests of all for the company to stand, in order that each one may hear and follow what is expressed by the leader. It is the motive inducing the action that really counts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If one takes the extreme position that he will not bow down in prayer, and that he will not close his eyes in prayer, the chances are that his motive is selfish; and if so, it is just as displeasing to the Lord as it is to follow the other extreme in formalism. If he is doing it for the purpose of attracting attention to himself, that he has put away all formalism, then his motive is selfish and is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That Jesus taught his disciples to pray, there cannot be the slightest doubt. It is also certain that they often prayed together. (Acts 1:14; 6:4; 12:5; Eph. 6:18) That kneeling in prayer is proper is shown by the words of God’s prophet, “0 come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.” (Ps. 95:6) Jesus kneeled down when he prayed, and it must have been done in the presence of his disciples, for them to know about it. (Luke 22:41) It is evident that the apostles followed the advice and teachings of Jesus, and deported themselves accordingly in prayer. They kneeled down in prayer. (Acts 9:40) Paul assembled with members of the church at Ephesus for instructing them in the way that they should go, and prayed with them, kneeling. “And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all. ’ ’—Acts 20: 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On another occasion Paul was with a company of men, women and children and they all kneeled down and prayed together. (Acts 21:5) It was proper then for the children as well as all others to kneel. That kneeling in prayer was and is the proper attitude and one which the apostle followed, and which he taught the members of the church to follow, is further shown by his words, “For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.”—Eph. 3:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let no one, therefore, be deceived or misled by the extremist. Follow the instruction of God’s Word, and let your motive in so doing always be pure, and the result will be pleasing to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I</span><span class="font4">N THAT DAY </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">shall ye say, Praise Jehovah, proclaim his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted. Sing unto Jehovah; for he hath done excellent things: this make known in all the earth. Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion; for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.</span><span class="font4"> ... Ye </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">that make mention of Jehovah, keep not silence.—</span><span class="font4">Isaiah.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark20"></a>THE TRUTH IN JAPAN</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font5">HE </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> readers will rejoice with our Japanese brethren that the truth is getting a good foothold in that land, and that a number are entering fully into the service of the Lord to magnify his name. The following letter from the Society’s representative will be read with interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Just returned from China-Korean trip. On this trip I visited brothers and sisters at Port Arthur, Seoul, Ileijo and Jinsen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mr. and Mrs. K. Tanno, of Port Arthur, got into the truth through </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp, Deliverance</span><span class="font4"> and Japanese </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower, </span><span class="font4">also </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age.</span><span class="font4"> They symbolized their consecration on May 22, 1930. They have thirty acres of orchard. But they decided to sell the whole property to get into the colporteur service at once. They will work among Japanese in Manchuria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mr. T. Terai, an engineer of Kyoto Electric Co., and his wife symbolized their consecration last February. He quit the job and entered into the colporteur service since May 15. His wife also has such a great joy in the service. They have four children; the eldest of them is only nine years old, Mr. and Mrs. K. Inouye, a blacksmith of Ilikata, symbolized their consecration just a few months ago. On May 31 they quit the profession and gave away his factory to his employee. They are going to leave their native place for newly assigned territory to work as colporteurs. They have two small children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mrs. N. Nishikawa, of Kumamoto, and her two daughters got the truth, and were baptized just three weeks ago. The younger daughter quit her school and now they have left their native place for another city to work as colporteurs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Miss Gokishuku, a Korean geisha girl (a slave), got the truth last year. She prayed the Lord to get into the colporteur service. The Lord answered her prayer and he miraculously rescued her from slave life when I was in Korea last month. Korean and Japanese friends gladly paid a part of her debt. The balance of the debt will be paid monthly. This is a quite unusual thing in Korean geisha life. But the  Lord used the chief of police and another high official to make her free. Now she is very active in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Miss Kinairaku and Miss Joheijin, both Korean and former geisha girls, are very active in the  colporteur service. Lord bless them richly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Ina, a small town of Nagano-ken, six Japanese left their church and they are studying the truth earnestly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is the present condition here in Japan and Korea. You may see how “young men” get understanding of the Lord’s <sup>1</sup> ‘ visions ’ ’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Both Catholic and Protestant systems are </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">entirely helpless </span><span class="font4">against the I.B.S.A. now. More new ones are coming into the  truth quick. Also, the “evil servant” class do something against the Lord’s anointed; but they are helpless too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We shipped paper mats of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font4"> to Brooklyn. Please print 10,000 of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your fellow servant by his grace,</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark22"></a>OTHER LETTERS</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE LORD'S WORK, NOT MAN'S</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font4">feel that I must express my appreciation of the articles in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower. I</span><span class="font4"> have just finished reading Part 2 of “Peace and Evil”. It seems so clear that it is a wonder that it never struck us in this way before; but, of course, it was not “due time”. We might ask, What benefit did the Israelites derive from their experiences in Egypt? The Bible tells us that they even wanted to return to the land of bondage. (Ex. 16:3) They soon forgot what they had suffered there, but the “flesh pots” lingered lovingly in their minds. Human nature has not changed; even now we still remember the sweet and forget the bitter. It may be that at the beginning of the Millennial age many people will resent the strict laws that will then to be in force, and inwardly, if not outwardly, rebel and long for some imaginary privilege that they had during this age. Although they will have to acknowledge Jehovah, yet it may take some time before they learn that these laws will bo for their good. Under these circumstances what benefit would they receive by their past experiences? If experience counts, then we might say that a man now bad ought to have a better chance in the future than one who had tried to do good, as he will have had more experience with sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font4"> like wine, is improving with age. Every number is overflowing with beautiful explanations of the Bible. It is quite clear that it is the Lord’s work, and not man’s. When I look back I can compare </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower to</span><span class="font4"> an artist painting a portrait. At first only an outline is seen, a beautiful and true copy of the original, and one to which we were attracted, although only an outline, to its beauty and grandeur. But the artist docs not stop there. Ho pencils out the high lights and shadows, the face is rounded out, color is added, and the picture, now more beautiful than ever, begins to show expression and detail, while the original outline lias in no way been changed. So it is with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower:</span><span class="font4"> the fundamental truths taught through its pages have always been the same, but God’s lightnings are now opening out to us the beauty and harmony of the Scriptures as never before. My prayer is that the Lord will continue to use you and all associated with you at the Watch Tower in this glorious work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DENUNCIATIONS AND WORDS OF LIFE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother in Christ:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your lectures received each Sunday over WOWO, Fort Wayne, Ind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I write tins to add a bit of encouragement to your endeavors to put the message of Truth over to the people, as a faithful witness to the Lord, and as an example and encouragement to those whose hands may become slack at this time of triune oppression, namely, Clergy, Politics and Industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your denunciations are clear and fearless, and your words of life timely and inspiring. Truly they must and do find lodging in the hearts of many people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I pray for the Lord’s grace upon you and all of like faith, to stand firm in these closing days of Satan’s activities and persecution of the followers of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yours in Christ’s name,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">TRULY A GREAT PRIVILEGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brethren:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The friends at Decatur all heard Brother Rutherford’s lecture yesterday; and truly it was a soul-inspiring message to the Lord’s people at this time, and for their comfort and encouragement to continue on in the service of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We all entered the field after the  lecture, and all had an enjoyable time preaching this gospel of the  kingdom until we were rained out. Truly it is a great privilege to serve in the cause of Jehovah God and have favor with him through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With Christian love,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“SATAN IS HOT”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">My dear Brother Rutherford,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sir:</span><span class="font4"> Being very full and running over from the increased light, joy and encouragement, and the renewed zeal that I have received from reading your last and wonderful book, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy,</span><span class="font4"> please bear with me and allow me to speak. It is the most wonderful, clearest, brightest of the Biblical studies. Why, no wonder that Satan is hot and ever getting still hotter, so </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font4"> speak. The book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font4"> turns him and his crooked organization up. He is the father of crooks and crookedness. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font4"> has turned more light on him and his crooked organization; and the light gets brighter and brighter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I’ve gone through the wonderful book, and do mean to review it daily, as much as possible, with the other studies, of course. From the strength and help I have received from this volume my mind was made to fall upon the hymn of which I send you herewith a copy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your brother by his grace,</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">* * *</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MORE GRACE GIVE ME</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Maitland, C.M.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Each moment, Lord, more grace give me To witness to thy name,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To keep my mind e’er stayed on thee, To boldly speak thy fame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Time is no more. The way seems hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Please be thou still my guide;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ne’er doubting, help me press onward, By thine help ’lone supplied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While witnessing now here below</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Satan, a roaring lion,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I see each day a deadly foe, With all his sharp design.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Endure the test! Thus can be proved</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">My faithfulness to God;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If from his way I’ll not be moved, But strive each day more hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RESOLUTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the business mooting of the Seattle ecdesia, held Monday evening, April 14, 1930, the following resolution was presented and unanimously adopted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Resolved, That the .Seattle ecclesia assure our beloved president, Brother Rutherford, that they deplore the bitter attack made upon him at the question meeting held in Los Angeles, Calif., on February 23, and fully sympathize with him in all his efforts to serve Jehovah, our God and our King; and that we, in view of the  strong assaults of the  enemy at this timo and the falling away of many who for yeais in the past have walked with us, do by letter assure him of our firm belief that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font4"> is the channel which Jehovah, our God, is using at this timo to instruct the  faithful remnant who are  keeping the commandments of God and have the  testimony of Jesus Christ, and we, therefore, very thankfully accept the  teachings of that journal and are  earnestly endeavoring to carry on the  Lord’s work in full accord therewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And be it further resolved, That we assure Brother Rutherford we have full confidence in him as a loyal and diligent servant of our King, and an instrument used of Jehovah to dispense meat in due season to his household; and recognizing in our beloved brother one such as is spoken of in 1 Thessalonians 5:12,13 and Hebrews 13:17, we esteem him very highly in love for his work's sake, and our prayers will still ascend that it may bo the  good pleasure of our God to keep and guide him to the  end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Resolved, That our class secretary forward a copy of this resolution to Brother Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your brother by his grace,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">T. </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Forsyth, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Secretary.</span></p>
