<h3><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark4"></a>THIS JOURNAL</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font2">HIS journal is published for the purpose of aiding the people to understand Jehovah’s purposes. It provides systematic Bible study in which all its readers may regularly engage. It gives announcement of the visits made to Bible classes by traveling speakers, announces conventions, and gives reports thereof. It announces radio programs and publishes suitable Bible instruction for broadcasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It adheres strictly to the Bible as God’s revealed Word of Truth. It stands firmly upon the great ransom sacrifice as the fundamental doctrine by which all doctrines are measured. It is free from parties, sects and creeds of men. It does not assume a dogmatic attitude, but confidently invites a careful examination of its utterances in the light of the infallible Word of God. It does not indulge in controversies, and its columns are not open to personalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, the Maker of heaven and earth, and is from everlasting to everlasting; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation; that the Logos became a man; that he is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and in earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, and created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrongful act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JESUS was made a human being in order that he might become the Redeemer of man; that he gave his life a sacrifice for man and thereby produced the ransom price; that Jesus the divine was raised from the dead, ascended into heaven, and presented the value of his human sacrifice as the redemptive price for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT FOR MANY CENTURIES God, through Christ, has been selecting from amongst men the members of his church, which constitutes the body of Christ; that the mission of the church is to follow in the footsteps of her Lord Christ Jesus, grow in his likeness, give testimony to the name and purpose of Jehovah God, and ultimately be glorified with Christ Jesus in his heavenly kingdom; that Christ, Head and body, constitutes the “seed of Abraham’’ through which all families of the earth shall be blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE WORLD HAS ENDED; that the Lord Jesus has returned and is now present; that Jehovah has placed Christ Jesus upon his throne and now commands all nations and peoples to hear and obey him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">TH</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font2">T THE IIOPE OF THE PEOPLES of earth is restoration to human perfection during the reign of Christ; that the reign of Christ will afford opportunity to every man to have a fair trial for life, and those who obey will live on earth for ever in a state of happiness.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark8"></a>BEARING FRUIT</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Herein is my Father glorified, that ye hear much fruit; so shall ye he my disciples.’’—John 15:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH has expressed his purpose to bring honor to his word and name and to fully vindicate himself before all his creatures and that he will do so by employing the services of his beloved Son. The birth of the babe Jesus was announced amidst a song of praise to Jehovah God because he whom God would use to bring glory to his name had come. For many centuries the good angels of heaven had watched the wicked one lead his wicked host in bringing reproach upon the name of God. Now God, with the birth of Jesus, began to make known to the host of heaven in a tangible form that he would send forth his mighty One to bring honor to his name. Learning this the angelic host sang together: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men. ’ ’—Luke 2:14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> In due time the man Jesus entered upon the performance of his covenant, and he faithfully performed it. God had made a covenant w’ith Jesus for the kingdom. Because of his faithfulness and diligence in preaching the message of the kingdom the leaders of Israel not only rejected him, but sought his life. They attempted to suppress the truth, and, being unable to do that, killed the Lord of glory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> At the time the words in the text above quoted were spoken by the Master his earthly ministry was done. He was about to take his departure from his disciples who for three years and more had sat at his feet and learned of God’s purposes. On that same night he had partaken of the last passover, and was now about to fulfil the type. He had instituted the Memorial of his own death, and after this had told his disciples of the covenant that God had made with him for the kingdom; and then he invited the eleven faithful ones to enter into that covenant with him that they might share with him in the kingdom. They had signified their desire to do so. The time was opportune to give them some special instruction which not only wmuld be beneficial to those eleven men, but likewise would be beneficial to all thereafter who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ and who would become his footstep followers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> This is the proper setting of the text, and the true situation at the time Jesus spoke the wonderful wmrds contained in John the fifteenth chapter, verses one to eleven. We may know that he would be keenly interested in telling his disciples what was necessary for them to fulfil their covenant for the kingdom. They had heard him tell ihe clergy of Israel that the kingdom should be taken from them because they had not brought forth the fruits thereof, and now Jesus ■was instructing his disciples of the necessity of bringing forth the fruits of the kingdom in order to perform the covenant concerning the kingdom. It is clearly seen therefore that the ‘ fruits of the kingdom ’ mentioned by him to the Pharisees, and the “fruit” mentioned that his disciples must bring forth, refer to one and the same thing.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> That which Jesus stressed on that occasion was the importance to the disciples of bringing forth fruit that the name of Jehovah might be glorified. He was not telling them of what they must do to glorify themselves. Satan had put the word and name of Jehovah at issue by his challenge to God to put a man on earth who would maintain his integrity with God. The determination of that issue in favor of Jehovah would bring honor and glory upon his word and upon his name. Jesus had been put to the test in this, that Satan had used every possible means to cause Jesus to be unfaithful to his covenant with God; but Satan had failed. Jesus had maintained his integrity under the test, and now he w’as about to be put to the final and crucial test. That test came, and he willingly went to death, and won. God then raised Jesus up out of death and ‘gave him a name which is above every name’ and commanded that all should worship him; that to him every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that he is the Christ, to the glory of God. (Phil. 2:7-11) In giving him the name above all other names the name of Jehovah, of course, is excepted. Jesus holds the highest name of any creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>0</sup> How had Jesus brought honor and glory to the name of Jehovah God? Manifestly by his faithfulness and unswerving devotion to God under the greatest of all tests. Because of his faithfulness to Jehovah he had proven Jehovah’s word and name to be right</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and honorable. Therefore Jehovah gave to him the kingdom. In like manner must his body members, taken into the covenant for the kingdom, bring honor to the name of Jehovah. This they do by faithfully performing the terms of the covenant with Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">’ For many years the application of the words of Jesus concerning the vine and the branches has been substantially as follows: That when one is consecrated to the Lord he becomes a branch in the vine, Christ; that from that time forward he makes progress and must develop fruits; that he is first a small tendril, or feeler;, that he then grows into a branch with leaves, representing his profession; that he then develops a bud and blossom and later hard green fruit and that this fruit continues to grow and increase until it is fully ripened and, when ripe, is ready for the kingdom and God plucks him and takes him into the kingdom; and that this development is what is generally understood as the ‘ ‘ development of the character likeness of Jesus Christ” or “the development of character”.—See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">SS,</span><span class="font3"> Vol. 5, p. 206; Vol. 6, p. 170; Z 1902, pp. 308-358.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> In brief, the conclusion was that one in Christ himself develops fruit and produces it and brings his character to a point that he is ready to be a member of the glorious kingdom of Christ. Surely the Lord did not mean that individuals could by the developing of themselves bring themselves into such a condition that God would need them and would take them in and make them a part of his kingdom. That would be equivalent to saying that the individual could lift himself up to a point where God would need him. Such a result could in no wise affect the great issue of God’s word and name, and surely could bring no glory to Jehovah God. The interpretation is therefore not supported by the Scriptures. Furthermore, Jesus was not speaking of the fruit of the spirit. It is necessary to get the proper setting of any text, and the circumstances surrounding it, in order to have a better understanding. Seeing the situation and the setting of the text, and the conditions under which Jesus spoke the words, we now come to a consideration of the real meaning thereof.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> In that same conversation Jesus said to his disciples: ‘I go away to prepare a place for you; and I will come again and receive you to myself, that where I am there ye may be also.’ Undoubtedly that place mentioned by him meant God’s organization which he has prepared and given to Jesus, and of which Jesus is the Head, and is, to wit, the kingdom. It is the new organization, and that which becomes the capital of God’s universal organization. It is the holy Jerusalem. In order for his followers to be instructed as to what would be required of them, Jesus used the vine and the branches as an illustration. As heretofore stated in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font3"> and supported by the Scriptures, both a tree and a vine represent a living creature, and, when good, represent an instrument in God’s hands, used for his purposes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> He begins this discourse with the words: “I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.” (Vs. 1) By this he plainly says that Jehovah is the one who has planted the vine because he is the one that selected and appointed Jesus to the position of the great High Priest and chief Executive Officer and Head of the kingdom. It is Jehovah’s vine or tree and Jehovah’s fruit which he produces. Without the Father Jehovah, nothing could be accomplished; therefore Jesus was acting specifically upon the instruction from Jehovah and as his instrument. Those who would be associated with Jesus in his organization and kingdom are likened unto branches in that true vine, and every branch will be required to bear or bring forth fruit; and those who put forth an effort in obedience to the commandment to bear or bring forth fruit God would prove or disapprove, that they might be enabled to more efficiently perform their covenant. This is supported by verse two.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> Then Jesus proceeds to tell his disciples how they became members or branches in the true vine. It is manifest from his words that one is not a branch in the true vine from the very moment he is begotten or brought forth as the son of God. The great company or those who will form that company are each brought forth as sons of God, yet at no time are any of them branches in the true vine. The disciples of Jesus were Jews and in the covenant with God which he made with the nation of Israel, with Moses as the chief one. Jesus had now told them the truth, to wit, that he is the Messiah whom Moses foreshadowed and that God had appointed him to be the King and Ruler and that through his kingdom God would accomplish his expressed purposes. Having believed upon the Lord Jesus Christ as the Messiah, God transferred them from the covenant with Moses to the covenant of sacrifice of Christ, that they might be a part of the seed of promise.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> His disciples believed Christ Jesus, and so confessed him, and declared their purpose to follow in his footsteps. Therefore he said to them: “Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.” (Vs. 3) Having been transferred from Moses to Christ, these faithful men had been given to Jesus by Jehovah as his own. Jesus had manifested the name of Jehovah to these faithful men, told them of his purpose, and told them that if they would abide by the terms of the covenant for the kingdom they would be permitted to bring glory and honor to the name of Jehovah. This conclusion is clearly supported by the words of Jesus in John 17: 6: “I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> These men had not yet been anointed of the holy spirit. That anointing they received at Pentecost. They were, however, in the covenant of Christ for the kingdom, and hence God confirmed and ratified that covenant at Pentecost by anointing them with his spirit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> Since the days of the apostles others have been brought into Christ in this manner: By exercising faith in the shed blood of Jesus Christ as the Redeemer ; by a full consecration or agreement to do the will of God; by being justified by Jehovah and then taken into the covenant by sacrifice and brought forth as the sons of God, or spirit creatures. To all such the call to the kingdom was given. Some responded to the call, but many did not; as Jesus stated: “Many are called but few chosen.” Those who responded to the call and continued faithful and were chosen received the anointing as members of the body of Christ, some receiving it before the Lord came to his temple, and the more general outpouring of the holy spirit taking place at the time the Lord came to his temple.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup> “Christ” means the “anointed” One, and no one is truly in Christ as a branch in the true vine until he is anointed. It is the chosen and anointed ones that must now prove faithful unto death if they would be made members in the kingdom of glory. It is to this class or company that the words of Jesus concerning the vine, the branches, and the fruit, are addressed. These must have been begotten of the spirit, manifested the fruit of the spirit, and been anointed of the spirit, before they are in the class which Jesus addresses in this fifteenth chapter of John. That of itself shows that the fruit of the spirit, and the bearing the fruits, or bringing forth the fruits of the kingdom, do not refer to the same thing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> Jesus (the vine) and his body members (the branches) are one in this, that he is the Head, and directs the course of action of his body, and works under the direction of his head, the husbandman Jehovah, and the body members bear the fruit, or do work as directed by the Head; and this oneness he proves by his words: “Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.”— Vss. 4, 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>17</sup> This further proves that those who are in the body of Christ, in order for them to abide there, must bring forth the fruits of the kingdom, and must bring them forth according to the commandments of the Lord. One in Christ and then failing or refusing to bring forth or bear the fruits of the kingdom is taken away and destroyed. “If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.” (Vs. 6) This does not mean that such fall back into the “great company” class. Being in the covenant for the kingdom, there is no alternative: they must prove faithful if permitted to abide in the vine and ultimately to be of the kingdom in glory. No greater emphasis could be laid upon the vital importance of bringing forth or bearing the fruit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> The real purpose of bringing forth or bearing fruit is not to develop the individuals, but to bring honor or glory to Jehovah God’s name. So long as one abides in Christ, and even though he meets with many difficulties in bearing the fruit, he may ask what he will, in harmony with God’s way, with the assurance that all things shall be caused to work together for his good. “If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.” (Vss. 7,8) This is further corroborated by Paul’s statement in Romans 8: 28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>19</sup> How could one of most sweet, beautiful and pious character, as these words are generally understood, bestow any glory or honor upon Jehovah God? Surely no creature by growing to perfection could thereby glorify Jehovah. It is what the creature does in obedience to God’s commandment that brings honor and glory to God. Looking back over the history of Christendom, in brief this is what we find: A man of high moral standing in his community, strictly honest, chaste, virtuous, gentle and kind and diligent in striving to be just to his fellow men, regularly attends some church organization at least on Sunday, is called a real Christian, and he has been regarded as a model Christian and as one bearing real fruit. For many years he pursues this course apparently consistently. His head grows hoary with age and his locks hang down upon his shoulders and give him a pious appearance. His face is kind and sweet, and in this condition his days draw to a close. Many look upon him and say: What a beautiful character this man has! Surely God will give him a high place in his heavenly kingdom because he is fully ripe and ready to be plucked, and taken unto God for his purposes. The good man may never have brought forth any fruit of the kingdom whatsoever. He may never have even been taken into the covenant by sacrifice, but, having some faith in God, he lived what he considered to be a good life. Surely he was never taken into the covenant for the kingdom, and therefore could not bear any fruit of the kingdom. If fruit-bearing means the development of a good “character” it might be well said that the man here described met the requirements; but fruit-bearing does not mean “character development”, by any means.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE FRUIT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> What, then, is meant by “bearing fruit”? Again it is stated that Jehovah is the husbandman and the fruit is God’s fruit. The kingdom is God’s; and the fruit of the kingdom, therefore, is that life-sustaining substance provided by Jehovah for the benefit of his creatures; .to wit, the truth concerning God and his purposes. That the truth is Jehovah’s there cannot be the slightest doubt. “Thy word is truth.” (John 17:17) To know God and his purposes through Christ Jesus means life, and it is the fruit of the kingdom that brings life and sustains life. Christ Jesus and his body members, all one, are like one tree or vine. As a tree or vine holds forth or holds up the fruit upon which men feed and grow strong, even so Christ and those who abide in him hold forth the fruit of the kingdom, the vital, sustaining truth which is provided by Jehovah and given to sustain the life of creatures.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> The word “bear” used by Jesus concerning the fruit does not mean to produce or grow fruit. It means to carry, to uphold, to move, and to bring forth and serve. In verse two of the fifteenth chapter of John the word “bear” is used exactly as the words “bringeth forth” are used in verse five. Concerning the same fruit, the words of Jesus concerning the kingdom are these: “The kingdom of God shall be . . . given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.” Without a question of doubt Jesus referred to the same fruits mentioned by him in the fifteenth chapter of John, and again lays down the rule that those who will be of and possess the kingdom are the'ones that bring forth the fruits thereof and that no one can be of the kingdom who does not bring forth or bear the fruits thereof.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DONE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> How can a Christian bear or bring forth fruits of the kingdom? The Scriptural answer is, by obeying the commandments of God to preach the gospel of the kingdom. The commission that Jehovah bestows upon all who are brought into the body of Christ is to preach the gospel of the kingdom. (Isa. 61:1-3) These must (1) preach or bring forth the fruits of the kingdom to those who are of Zion and who are God’s people. These need the life-sustaining substance, the fruit of the kingdom of God, and it is the privilege and duty of those anointed in Christ to carry this fruit to one another. Hence by love they are serving one another. (2) The anointed are commissioned to tell the good news of the kingdom to all who are teachable and who desire to be taught.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> Jehovah God is the King Eternal. How many know that fact ? Not very many. To his anointed ones Jehovah says: “Ye are my witnesses, . . . that I am God,” besides whom there is none other. (Isa. 43:10,12) He sends forth his anointed to give testimony of this fact, and this is bearing the fruit of the kingdom by telling the people how the blessings will come to them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> Many have made a covenant to do the will of God and all such are begotten of Jehovah and are called to the kingdom. The greater number have either failed or refused to respond to the call. They have said in substance: ‘We will grow sweet and good and meet together and study and meditate upon God’s Word, and thus we will develop the Christ-like character, and thus continue until we are ripe, and then God will take us into the kingdom.’ They do not even respond to the call for the kingdom and present themselves a living sacrifice unto God. A small number do respond to and accept the call and go forth with a zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house, showing their devotion to Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> The days of pruning arrive and the separation begins and progresses. It is well known from the facts that from about 1875 to 1918 all the Lord’s people walked together. In 1918 and 1919, at the coming of the Lord to his temple, all were subjected to a severe test. Why did the Lord do that? The answer is that this was a severe pruning experience, that the faithful might be made manifest and might bring forth more fruit. (Vs. 2) Shortly following the end of the World War, and the coming of the Lord to his temple, he gave the commandment to the pruned ones, or disciplined ones, and to these said: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall the end come.”—Matt. 24:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>26</sup> Those who had been faithful and diligent in obeying the commandments of the Lord and had thus shown their love for God and for Christ, upon them the Lord then bestowed even greater love. To these approved ones the invitation was given to ‘enter into the joy of the Lord’, and this is in harmony with the words of Jesus: “As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you; continue ye in my love. If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love. These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.” (Vss. 9-11) God has taken Jesus and his body members into partnership with him for the kingdom. Those on earth have some work to do, and they are made members of the “faithful and wise servant”. Their work is then to bring forth or bear the fruits of the kingdom, and this they do by diligently looking after the interests of the kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHO IS DOING IT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>27</sup> The nation of Israel fell because it did not bring forth the fruits of the kingdom. “Organized Christianity,” or “Christendom”, has failed because it has brought forth no fruits of the kingdom, but, on the contrary, has brought forth a death-dealing corrupt fruit of Satan’s organization. All human schemes are contrary to God’s kingdom; therefore corrupt. During the past fifty years many who have agreed to do</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">God’s will have failed to bring forth any fruits of the kingdom, and because thereof have been turned aside and become members of the “evil servant”. Who, then, on earth today is included in the class bringing forth or bearing the fruits of the kingdom?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> There is but one organization; and that we call “the Society”, which forms a part of God’s organization. Those who are wholly devoted to God and who are diligent in proclaiming the message of his kingdom and testifying to his glory and his works are bringing forth the fruits of the kingdom. Every one of the kingdom class must preach the gospel. The majority of them preach the glad tidings by carrying the message of the kingdom in book form to the people. The “evil servant” class represent the great enemy, and under his influence insist that the Society is a book-selling arrangement operated for the benefit of man. This charge not only is false, but is a blasphemy against God because it brings reproach upon him and his work. Anyone who believes that charge should at once cease the work of placing books in the hands of the people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>29</sup> If the books are simply the scheme of men, then the followers of Christ Jesus should have nothing to do with them. If the books contain the message of God’s kingdom, that message is not man’s, but Jehovah’s message. It is his truth, and hence constitutes the fruits of his kingdom. If you believe such is true, then do not permit the enemy to beat down your courage or cause you to slack your hand in preaching the gospel. Go and put the message of truth in the hands of the people, that they may know who is the true and Almighty God. The more the gospel is preached by one, the more that one honors or glorifies the name of Jehovah. This undoubtedly is the meaning of the words that Jesus spoke in verse eight. Some have been earnestly and actively engaged in going from house to house, for a term of years, putting in their best efforts to spread the message of the kingdom and to speak for Jehovah. Such are bringing forth fruits to the glory of God. Tiiere is no organization under the sun aside from the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, which we commonly call “the Society”, that is today engaged in thus honoring the word and name of Jehovah; and in thus doing these are bringing forth the fruits of the kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>30</sup> God has chosen and pruned his faithful remnant that they might bring forth much fruit to his honor and glory. These have learned wisdom by obeying God’s commandments and have entered into the joy of the Lord. For their benefit it is written: “My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord; neither be weary of his correction; for whom the Lord loveth he correcteth: even as a father the son in whom he de-lightcth. Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding. For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. She is more precious than rubies; and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her. Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.”—Prov. 3:11-18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>31</sup> Happy is the anointed of God who bears the message of God’s kingdom to others, that the Word and name of Jehovah might be made known. By this means, and this alone, can his creatures on earth now bestow glory and honor upon his name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>32</sup> Prior to the coming of the Lord to his temple there were some of the Lord’s sons on earth diligently engaged in preaching the gospel. After the coming of the Lord to his temple the faithful were brought into the temple and the holy spirit poured out upon all regardless of their former position or whether they were male or female, and then it became the privilege of all to do preaching. That explains why there have been more really zealous ones in the field work during the past few years than before, and also why many who claim to be in line for the kingdom have fallen away. Those having the opportunity to bear the fruits of the kingdom and failing to do so have beeri gathered out and turned aside. The Lord has sent forth his angels to gather them out because they became offended at his methods and work iniquity or take an unlawful course.—Matt. 13: 41,42.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>33</sup> No one who has the spirit of the Lord will be so foolish as to deceive himself, or be deceived, by saying that he can follow a loose, immoral and unchaste course of action and justify himself therein upon the ground that he does not have to “develop character”. Each creature is a character. No creature develops a character separate and distinct from himself. Each creature or character should strive at all times to keep himself fully in harmony with the will of God. At the very beginning he should heed the admonition of the Lord’s Word and cleanse himself from all filthiness of the flesh and the spirit, and perfect holiness in the Lord. To clean up and wholly devote oneself to the Lord is the way to obey this scripture. It is easy to see, therefore, that merely pursuing a course of virtue in thought, word and action is not sufficient. The son of God must do that and much more. He must perform his covenant. lie does so by bearing the fruits of the kingdom to others. The more zealous and faithful he is in so doing, the more pleasing he is to God, and the more he honors his name. Blessed is the one who has the privilege now of bearing the fruits of the kingdom!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>31</sup> The rule that Jesus announced shows that no one can be of the kingdom who fails or refuses to avail himself of opportunities that come to him to bring forth the fruits of the kingdom. Since the Lord has laid down this rule, why should he take any one into the kingdom who does not obey his commandments and do it joyfully ?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>33</sup> What, then, is the distinction between the fruits of the kingdom and the fruit of the spirit? It is written in Galatians 5: 22, 23: “ But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.” Note that the scripture says, not </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fruits,</span><span class="font3"> but “fruit of the spirit”, and that the “fruit of the spirit is love”. The other things mentioned in the same text necessarily accompany love. Love means an unselfish devotion to God in obeying his commandments. Those who are begotten and anointed of the holy spirit, in order to be faithful, must be perfect in love, that is to say, must devote themselves wholly to Jehovah and support his cause and do his service and do it unselfishly. It is the holy spirit of God operating in the creature that develops love in him and therefore results in the fruit or outgrowth of the spirit. He who is unselfishly devoted to God is in the joy of the Lord, and he has the peace of God. He suffers long and yet maintains his confidence and his integrity to God; he is gentle and manifests goodness and much faith; he is meek or teachable, and he is temperate, or exercises self-control. But none of these things are the fruits of the kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>36</sup> It is the life-sustaining substance of God’s Word of truth which constitutes the fruits of the kingdom, which the child of God must bear or bring forth and serve to others.. There is therefore a wide distinction between the fruits of the kingdom and the fruit of the spirit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>37</sup> But how is one perfected in love, which is the fruit of the spirit? Not by means of idleness and indifference concerning the witness work. He proves his love by keeping the commandments of God. This is the day of judgment, since the Lord has come to his temple; and concerning this and love it is written: “Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world. There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear; because fear hath torment. Be that fearcth is not made perfect in love.” (1 John 4:17,18) He who fears to offend any part of Satan’s organization or fears that some one will not think so well of him, and for that reason refrains from a bold proclamation of the message of the kingdom at this time, is not perfect in love. It is those who love the Lord that are bringing forth the fruits of the kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE REMNANT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>38</sup> There was a remnant of the nation of Israel that remained faithful to God. It was that remnant that came to a knowledge of the truth during the earthly ministry of Jesus and at Pentecost and shortly thereafter. That remnant of Israel foreshadowed the remnant of the consecrated who are on earth particularly at the end of the world. At the time Christ Jesus came to his temple there were a number of people on earth who had made a covenant to do the will of God, many of whom had not responded to the call for the kingdom. These not having responded to the call for the kingdom, to be sure, had not been taken into the covenant. Probably some who had responded to the call became unfaithful. The separating work began with the beginning of the judgment at the house of God. Then the faithful and approved ones Jesus put in one class and designated them that “faithful and wise servant”. To these he committed all his goods. The “fruits of the kingdom”, “his goods,” the “talents” and the “pounds”, all mean the same thing, and all mean the kingdom interests.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>39</sup> God committed to Jesus Christ the great work of giving the testimony concerning his Word and name. To those who were approved at the judgment, and have been brought into the covenant for the kingdom, and who continue faithful, the Lord has committed the obligation of giving the testimony on earth. Hence these are spoken of as the remnant that keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. (Rev. 12:17) Those of the remnant have been anointed by the Lord; hence the •words of the apostle apply to them: “As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him: rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. ’ ’—Col. 2:6,7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>40</sup> As the remnant of Israel was made manifest, so now the remnant of spiritual Israel is made manifest. This remnant has escaped or been brought out from and made separate from the less faithful ones who were of Jerusalem, the general organization of the Lord on earth. Hence it is written of and concerning the faithful remnant now on earth: “And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward: for out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do this.” (Isa. 37:31,32) Rooted and grounded in Christ, made separate and distinct from the world, these bear the fruit of the kingdom upward to the glory of Jehovah God, and continue to sing forth the praises of his name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SUMMARY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>41</sup> Summing up the matter, then, it is clear to be seen that of all those on earth who have agreed to do God’s will, only a remnant thereof are approved and receive the anointing and show their faithfulness to the covenant. These are in the covenant for the kingdom and they are bearing the fruits of the kingdom to the Lord’s glory. They do this by carrying the message of the kingdom of God to others who are in need of this life-sustaining message of truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>42</sup> Those who will continue to diligently perform their covenant to the end will receive, according to God’s promise, an abundant entrance into his everlasting kingdom. Continuing to bring forth faithfully the kingdom interests or kingdom fruits, these shall dwell in the house of Jehovah forever, beholding his beauty, and will continue to learn of him and give Jehovah God the devotion, honor and glory that is due his name. With joy these will see in the kingdom the full and complete vindication of the word and name of the Most High.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark10"></a>DIVINE FOREKNOWLEDGE: PROOF THAT JEHOVAH IS GOD</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">[Thirty-minute radio lecture]</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font3">HE greatest study of man is Jehovah God. Such a study, honestly and persistently continued, not only will give the student a better and grander conception of the wisdom, justice, love and power of Jehovah God, but will increase his reverence for, and his gratitude to, the one who is the Author of his existence, and the Giver of every good and perfect gift that he possesses. Men have made a mistake in the past in claiming that the greatest study of mankind is man. Any study of man for the purpose of exalting man, invariably results in making the student arrogant, proud, boastful, stubborn and conceited. The reason for this is that such a student credits all the wealth, knowledge and inventions which men possess to the ability and prowess of men, and soon gets to the point where he denies that there is a God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Any study of man from the standpoint of his being one of the fearful and wonderful creations of God, and for the purpose of getting a better knowledge of God, of course is entirely proper. Such a study of man will lead the student to have more humility, reverence, love and gratitude in his heart; and if persisted in, it will eventually lead him to become the faithful servant of the most high God. All the inventions, all the attainments, all the possessions and all the blessings that men have, are direct gifts from God. He gave to man his mind, with its inclination toward study, investigation and invention. He made all the laws and principles which govern and control everything in the universe, and created all the material upon which man works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is a well known fact that every great invention, every discovery of science, and every known fact, was stumbled upon, originally, by its discoverer. The great chemists experiment and experiment, for many years, and then, purely by accident, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">discover</span><span class="font3"> something; and having discovered the original principle, which was there all the time and was placed there by an all-wise and loving Creator, the chemist uses his inventive and investigative powers, which God gave him, and further elaborates on his discovery. Who, then, should be credited with the discovery? Certainly not the chemist. He did not make a single one of the laws, facts, or materials involved in the discovery. Just so the mining prospector does not know where the gold or diamonds are; but someone discove purest accident, some </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">evidences</span><span class="font3"> that there is diamonds in that vicinity. Then, using the evidences that God has provided, he locates the lodes and, as </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font3">rule, proceeds to give himself credit for the discovery, and forgets the great Creator, who made the gold and placed it there for the blessing of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus, through long centuries, the name and the majesty of the great Jehovah have been overlooked; and gradually mankind have come to laud and reverence and honor the creature more than the Creator. They worship the created thing (mankind) more than the One who created it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It would seem almost incredible that the great Jehovah must have proofs brought forward to show to his creatures that he is the one supreme God, and therefore the only One entitled to worship. Yet this is a fact, and the purpose of this lecture is to produce another proof that Jehovah is God. In this matter of vindicating his own name Jehovah is very patient and considerate, and has provided two most wonderful books, which are open to anybody who honestly desires to investigate. These two books are the Bible and the book of nature; and both testify to the very same thing, namely, that there is but one God, that he is the Creator of all things, that his wisdom, justice, love, and power far transcend those of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is probably true that imperfect man cannot fully and properly comprehend the attributes of Jehovah; and in large measure this is due to the fact that all men are imperfect both in organism and in their reasoning faculties. But the studious, thoughtful and reverential man can approximate these attributes by a careful study of the two books divinely provided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus himself said: &quot;Search the scriptures; for . . . they are they which testify of me. ” The psalmist declares that &quot;the heavens declare the glory of God: and the firmament sheweth his handy work”. Thus we have proof that God intended man to investigate these books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There could be no greater or more convincing proof of the majesty of Jehovah God than the fulfilment of prophecy exactly on time and exactly as foretold. The chief reason for foretelling future events is to prove the majesty of Jehovah; and what is known as human history today is made up, in large measure at least, of prophecy fulfilled. These fulfilments are so marked that every sensible man should be able to convince himself that Jehovah is God, and worthy of his heart’s best devotion and service. These fulfilments </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">will</span><span class="font3"> convince the teachable and reverential. But the proud, the arrogant, the selfish, the wilful and the high-minded will not be convinced; and for their stubbornness and wilfulness they must die the second death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God could not inspire one of his prophets to foretell future events unless he had accurate foreknowledge of that event. This fact alone places the great Jehovah on a plane far above any of his creatures; for no man, no, not even an angel, can foretell future events.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For many years God inspired Noah to warn the people of a coming flood. Thus God used Noah to utter a prophecy. Today the fact of the flood is found recorded in history over 4,000 years old, and this item of history is indisputable; for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">evidences of</span><span class="font3"> the flood are found with us today, so that all scientists admit the fact. Before the flood the people scorned Noah’s prophetic utterance, and later suffered death for their folly and arrogance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Leviticus 26:14-39, God told the nation of Israel that if they failed to keep their covenant he would scatter them among the Gentile nations, where they would be a byword and a hissing for a long period called ‘seven times’. This foretold period of punishment began when Nebuchadnezzar carried the Israelites to Babylon, in 606 B.C., and ended in 1914, exactly 2520 years later. In Jewish reckoning, a time is a Jewish year of 360 days. Seven times would be seven times 360 days, or 2520 days; and the Lord through his prophet tells us that, in prophecy, a day counts for a year.—Ezek. 4:4-6; Num. 14: 34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Jeremiah 31 and Ezekiel 37, God foretold that he would bring the nation of Israel back into their own land again after the expiration of their punishment, and plant them again in their own land. This prophecy is now being fulfilled before our eyes. The people of Israel are now returning to Palestine, and slowly but surely establishing a government there. And this has occurred since the ending of their seven times of punishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Again, in Matthew 24:7 is a prophecy uttered by Jesus, telling of a great world war followed by famines, pestilences and earthquakes in divers places. Jesus said that these events would be signs or proofs that the world had ended. The fulfilment of this prophecy began in the year 1914, with a great world war, which was followed by the foretold famines, pestilences and earthquakes, exactly as predicted. Most of the people now living have witnessed this fulfilment; but like the people in Noah’s day, they are heedless of the warnings given by fulfilled prophecy, and are so busily engaged in accumulating money and in caring for all their earthly interests that they do not realize they are rushing headlong to the battle of Armageddon, which will soon burst on the earth in all its fury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The first advent of our Lord was foretold, that he would be born of a virgin, and also that he would be born in Bethlehem of Judea. It was foretold that he would ride into the city on the colt, the foal of an ass; that his familiar friend would betray him; that he would be despised and rejected of men, and that he would be crucified. All of these prophecies have been fulfilled to the letter, and are now matters of history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yet there are people who deny that there is a God, and refuse to acknowledge his majesty and power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God is very patient with members of the fallen race, and has made many other prophetic statements to convince man that he is the great, supreme God. He has foretold many important events that are to take place in the very near future. But a few are here mentioned. He foretold that the nations of earth are to be dashed to pieces as a potter’s vessel (Dan. 2:44; Ps. 2:9; Rev. 11:15) ; that the nations shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks, and learn war no more (Isa. 2:2-4; Mic. 4:2-4; Ps. 46:9); that the desert shall blossom as the rose, and that the lion and the lamb shall lie down together and a little child shall lead them (Isa. 11:6-9; 35:1,2); that there shall be a resurrection of the dead; that the Devil shall be bound for a thousand years (John 5:28,29; Rev. 20:1-4) ; that there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain (Rev. 21:4) ; that the knowledge of the Lord shall cover the earth as the waters cover the sea; and that the time is coming when every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jehovah is God and is worthy of all praise and worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Man is so perverse and wicked and stupid that he will require all these evidences to convince him of the goodness and love of God. On the other hand, God is so kind, so long-suffering and patient, that he has been willing to forbear with mankind for six thousand years and to furnish every needed evidence, that man might learn to love and honor him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are many prophecies of a coming battle that will completely destroy all the political and the financial as well as the religious organizations of earth. This battle is called in the Bible the &quot;battle of that great day of God Almighty&quot;. Men call it &quot;the battle of Armageddon&quot;. This battle will destroy every evil and oppressive institution of earth, and at its close Satan will be bound for a thousand years. This battle is a battle between Jesus Christ as the representative of Jehovah God on one side, and the wicked, cruel and relentless Satan on the other. The Scriptures assure us that Christ will win and that Satan will lose. The purpose of the battle is not only to destroy all evil institutions, but to liberate mon from the power and tyranny of Satan’s organization and its deceptions. It will free men from ignorance, superstition, autocracy, tyranny, oppression and every other bondage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another object which God has in view in instituting this battle is to prepare the earth for the new government, the reign of Jesus Christ. Manifestly Satan’s empire could not exist at the same time that Christ would set up his kingdom; hence Satan’s is to be destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For the past ten years God has been serving notice on Satan that Armageddon is approaching, and that his kingdom is to be destroyed. He is also warning the people that if they stay in Satan’s organization and cooperate with Satan in this fight they, too, will be destroyed. This prophecy will soon be fulfilled. Jehovah will clear the earth of everything evil and corrupt and of every evil and selfish person, preparatory to establishing his kingdom of righteousness, peace, justice and love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Satan is well aware of this fact; and for a number of years has been preparing for the battle. He is organizing his forces in the earth, bringing them together in a solid, compact body, because he recognizes the fact that in union there is strength. We can better comprehend what that battle will mean when we understand God’s purpose in establishing his kingdom. God purposes to have just one government under the whole heaven, not fifty odd, as there are now. It was Satan that divided the nations and governments, and thus introduced jealousies and selfishness, and started wars. It was Satan that divided the people into about two hundred religious camps, and thus started religious bigotry and persecution, as well as the hundreds of false doctrines about God and the Bible. It was Satan that organized the great oppressive financial monopolies of earth, which profiteer at the expense of the people. These three elements of Satan’s empire are to be destroyed in this great battle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To keep his kingdom intact, Satan is trying to organize a league of nations, a federation of churches, and giant mergers of big business. His object in forming these unions is self-preservation and the preservation of his kingdom on earth. Of course, all these three elements hate those who are announcing their doom, and so are united in their opposition to the message that proclaims Armageddon near. The object of the league, federation and unions is to perpetuate these institutions which God has determined to destroy. Hence all their effort to unite is really opposition to the establishment of Christ’s kingdom. Hence the psalmist says that the kings of the earth and their rulers and their great men take counsel together against the Lord and against his anointed.—Ps. 2: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The League of Nations is the last desperate effort of Satan to weld his kingdom into one cohesive whole, so as to preserve it from destruction by the great King of Glory, who is now setting up his kingdom on earth. The Scriptures foretell the League of Nations, its utter failure and its final destruction, as one of the useless things that cumber the earth. Let us examine some of these texts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The second Psalm reads (verse 1, margin): &quot;Why do the nations tumultuously assemble [league together], and the people imagine a vain thing [namely, that they can avert destruction]?&quot; Verse 2: &quot;The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together [in peace conferences], against Lord, and against his anointed [the Lord’s anointed are his people on the earth].” Verse 3: “Saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.” (This text indicates that in some way the kings and rulers are being bound. It is the truth, which exposes their evil organization and its purpose, that is binding them.) Verse 4: “He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh; the Lord shall have them in derision.” Verse 5: “Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure. ’ ’ Verse 6: Jehovah says, “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.” Ah, yes; it was in the year 1914 that Jehovah set King Jesus on the throne. Now listen to verses 8 and 9. Jehovah speaks to his Son, saying, “Ask of me, and I shall give thee the nations for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them . . . in pieces like a potter’s vessel.” In verses 10,11, and 12, Jehovah utters a warning to the ruling classes of earth, as follows: “Be wise now, therefore, 0 ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish by the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This entire chapter is a warning from the Lord to those who are aiding Satan in the work of resisting the Lord in the establishment of his kingdom. Doubtless many of these are opposing unconsciously, and it is for this reason that attention is called to this warning at this time. The Lord is now serving notice on Satan and those who are members of Satan’s organization on earth, that he intends to destroy the same. This notice will also serve to warn those who are ignorantly serving Satan, so that they can get out of his service and take their stand on the Lord’s side in this great fight. All opposition will be a failure and will result in disaster to the opposers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Attention is called to another text which indicates the divine foreknowledge. It is another prophecy that the rulers of earth, political, financial and religious, would league and federate together, to perpetuate Satan’s kingdom on earth; and it points out the complete failure of such leagues and federations. This prophecy is recorded in Isaiah 8: 9-13. Verses 9 and 10 read: “Associate yourselves, 0 ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces: and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.” In verses 11 to 13 the Lord addresses his consecrated saints on the earth at the time these leagues and federations are going on, saying, “The Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying, Say ye not, A confederacy [a league], to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.” Thus in most positive language the Lord warns his chosen people to have no part in these federation and league movements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are three reasons why the Lord’s people should take no part in them: First, the Lord commands them to take no part; second, these leagues, federations and unions are in opposition to the Lord and his work; and third, we are specifically advised and warned that they will fail to accomplish the work which they seek to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many are the warnings which God has placed in his Word, regarding the coming destruction of the Devil’s organization. He placed these warnings there so that the honest-hearted and noble-minded people of earth might not be found fighting against the Lord. But we find few people who read the Bible and still fewer who believe it. Why is this so? The answer is, Satan has used the members of his organization to discredit the Bible so that the people will give no hoed to the warnings when these are sounded out. The great religious leaders of earth have brought reproach on the Bible; they have taught the people to have no confidence in it. They tell the people that it consists of allegories, old wives’ fables, folklore and child’s stories. They tell the people that they will go crazy if they study it too much; that it is an old fiddle on which you can play any tune, and in many other ways bring the Book into reproach and contempt and undermine confidence in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Jeremiah 6:10-14 is another warning, which reads: “To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their car is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the Lord is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it. Therefore I am full of the fury of the Lord; I am weary with holding in. . . . For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace: when there is no peace.” In 1 Thessalonians 5:3, the Apostle Paul adds his warning in these words: “When they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction comcth upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All the efforts put forth by men or devils cannot bring peace; neither can they hinder the establishment of Christ’s kingdom. God’s power to foreknow events has resulted in many warnings to the peoples of earth; and these warnings are now going out all over the earth, in many languages, by books and literature and over one hundred thirty radio stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Satan’s kingdom is now falling. It is making its last stand against the Lord. Jesus Christ has taken his power and begun ouster proceedings against Satan. The message is now going out, even the very words spoken by the prophet: “Associate yourselves, </span><span class="font4">0 </span><span class="font3">ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces.” Even now the Lord is laughing in derision at the puny efforts of men and Satan to thwart his purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the coming great battle of Armageddon it will be demonstrated that Jehovah is the one supreme God; and his name will be completely vindicated. His divine foreknowledge has given us another warning of the fall of Satan’s empire, in Daniel 2:44, which reads: “In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The foreknowledge of Jehovah God will be demonstrated again after the battle of that great day of God Almighty has finally and for ever destroyed Satan’s wicked and oppressive organization from the earth. That demonstration will be a most wonderful one. God has foretold a resurrection of the dead, both of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">just and of the unjust.</span><span class="font3"> (Acts 24:15; John 5:28, 29) Such a demonstration of the foreknowledge, as well as the wisdom, justice, love and power of God, ought to convince the most skeptical that Jehovah is God; and it ought to close for ever the mouths of boastful, bombastic, conceited men so that they will never again set themselves up as wiser than God and therefore more worthy of praise and honor than is Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The great kingdom of Christ, a thousand years long, will establish a perfect and lasting peace on earth. This, too, was foreknown and foretold, in Isaiah 9:6,7, which reads: “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder; ... of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was this foreknowledge of God, coupled with his absolute power, that caused him to utter by the prophet these words: “Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none else. I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall swear.” (Isa. 45:22,23) When this prophecy is fulfilled, it will be manifest to all that Jehovah is God, that he is supreme, that there is none other like him, and that he is worthy to be praised for ever and ever.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font6">THE PATH</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">[Fifteen-minute</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">W</span><span class="font3">HAT is truth? A heathen ruler asked that question of Jesus. Jesus, accused of being a bolshevist or revolutionist who was trying to overturn the Roman government, answered the charge, saying: “My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.” When the ruler asked: “Art thou a king then?” Jesus answered: “Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth hearcth my voice.” Did Jesus bear witness to the truth? His enemies had him arrested for committing no offense save that he taught the people, and they suborned witnesses to bear false testimony against him. Nevertheless, Jesus stood by all that he had taught, and went to a most disgraceful and painful death for it. If he had been a deceiver and seeking his own advantage, glory and gain, it would have been easy for him to avoid such sufferings. His very honesty and his unswerving faithfulness to what he preached should strengthen our faith that he had the real, all-important truth, and that he was not ashamed nor afraid to tell it out. His apostles, to whom he committed his word and teaching, were of the same manner of faithfulness</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark12"></a>OF TRUTH</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">radio lecture]</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and honesty, and refused to compromise God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It may be argued that many men have been honest in what they believed, and yet have been under a delusion; hence their honesty was no proof of having the truth. It cannot be shown, however, that Jesus was under any delusion. His miracles, duplicated by no one ever on this earth, prove that he was verily the Son of God come down to earth for the good of mankind. Nothing that has happened or been discovered from the time of his crucifixion down to our own day has disproved Jesus’ teachings or made them out of date. He prophesied of the conditions to exist among the peoples and nations at the end of this wicked age, and his prophecies have been fulfilled before our eyes by the peculiar world events since the year 1914, and are still undergoing fulfilment. Thus Jesus, after nineteen long centuries and in this day of world-wide unbelief, is confirmed as a prophet of truth; his word is proven to be reliable, faithful to fact, and in accurate harmony with what has been and what now is and what shall yet be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus said: “I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” (John 14: 6) It is most certain, therefore, that Jesus walked in the path of truth, and that there is no error in the path he trod. For selfish reasons and for the purpose of avoiding the hardships to be endured</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">the path of truth during this evil age, men have perverted Jesus’ teachings or added their own supposed wisdom, and have thus made it to appear that the way Jesus walked was full of stumblingstones of error.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For instance, men who have claimed to be religious and to be Bible authorities have taught that Jesus declared himself to be equal with God in power and glory and one with God in person or body, in fact, the second person in a godhead of three coequal gods. Also, that Jesus taught that the unreformable sinners would be kept alive eternally in the torments of literal fire and brimstone or in a state of mental torment worse than physical suffering. Also, that at his second coming this wonderful earth and all the magnificent stars and planets of our visible heavens would be reduced to smoke and ashes. Also, that until that dread time the great contest between God and the Devil was to see whether God could save more people to heaven than the Devil could drag down to a place of endless torment, which place is claimed to be the Bible hell. Also, that God has all along been punishing the people on our earth with calamities, plagues, horrible accidents, famines, earthquakes, and unspeakable catastrophes, just because men have not been converted and been persuaded to become Christians according to the general notion of what a Christian is or what he must believe and do to be one. Also, that in course of time Jesus in heaven accepted the wicked Roman empire as his kingdom, and that all the kingdoms and governments which were once part of this Roman empire have become and are the kingdom which he promised and taught us to pray for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Who can deny that such teachings as these have turned the multitudes away and have hindered them from walking the path of truth in Jesus’ footsteps? One of Jesus’ apostles, Peter, prophesied that this very condition would come, saying, ‘ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘ There</span><span class="font3"> were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you [Christians], who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">way of truth </span><span class="font3">shall be evil spoken of. ’ ’ The very fact that there has been such a nation-wide campaign against religion in what was once called “Holy Russia” testifies that false prophets or religious teachers have perverted true Christianity over there, and how now the real, genuine way or path of truth is not understood but is woefully evil spoken of. Undeniably, the increasing lack of interest in and turning away from organized religion in all so-called “Christian” lands bears witness to the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The International Bible Students Association, ever since its founding, has been awake to the root cause of the trouble, and is endeavoring to call people’s attention to the only remedy. Let the people turn from man’s teachings and go direct to the Bible itself as the guide in the path of sacred truth. In prayer to God, Jesus said: “Thy word is truth.” (John 17:17) That Word in Jesus’ day consisted of only the thirty-six books of the Old Testament, and Jesus used those books as textbooks of truth to teach the people. That Word today includes the writings of Jesus’ followers who were inspired by God’s spirit of truth to write the twenty-seven books of the New Testament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Modern scientists may be ever so thorough and painstaking, but when they draw their own conclusions from their findings and discoveries and in so doing ignore and contradict the Holy Scriptures, we may at once be sure that they are off the truth. The scientists have not given nor can. they give the people eternal life. The only science that will guarantee everlasting life to the people is the truth about God and his purposes. Whoever wants perfect and unending life must study God’s Word and obey it, for Jesus said: ‘ ‘ This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” Whoever desires to be free in heart and mind will gain true freedom, not by becoming an anarchist, nor even by studying all the so-called “science” contained in all the books in the world, but by going to the Word of the Lord, gaining its knowledge and wisdom, and living in harmony therewith. For the Savior said: “If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” It is error that makes dupes and slaves and fools of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The world is in a labyrinth of confusion, doubtless more so now than ever before. Hundreds and hundreds of religions and scientific theories lay claim to the truth and claim to lead to the light and to the grander, higher life eternal, but the people know not what to choose. They continue in their mental darkness and die unsatisfied and in the misery of uncertainty. The Bible prophecy of long ago is surely come true today, which says: “Darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people.” (Isa. 60: 2) The people are walking in hundreds of different paths. The Bible is scoffed at, disbelieved, and neglected, and instead the word of mere men claiming to be wise is accepted as authority and guide. The great need of the people is to seek the one and only path of divine truth. That they can do by forsaking the theories and systems of men, secular or religious, and seeking direct to the unperverted written Word of God. Back to the Bible! if you would walk in the path of truth that leads to light, life, and liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ever since Adam turned his back on God, men have groped in the path of darkness and death. Satan has led them there; as it is stated in 2 Corinthians, chapter four, verses three and four: “If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ . . . should shine unto them.” But during all this period of human darkness and erring, those who have feared the only true and living God, Jehovah, and have served him, have walked in the path of truth. “A God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.” (Deut. 32:4) “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.” Thus the faithful prophets, inspired by the God of truth to record the Old Testament, walked in the path of divine truth as far as God was pleased to reveal it to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the Christian era those who have accepted only God’s Word as the truth and who have stepped in Jesus’ footsteps, have walked in the right path. Today the path of infallible truth is brighter than at any previous time. Why? Because the prophecies of God’s Word are coming true and are proving that we have reached the “time of the end”, that is, the end of the darksome, invisible rule of Satan, the great blinder and misleader of men and the perverter of truth. God’s angel said to Daniel: “But thou, 0 Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book even to the time of the end; many shall run to and fro [that is, through the pages of the Holy Scripture, God’s Book], and knowledge shall be increased. . . . And none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.” The wise are they who turn to God’s now unfolding Word of truth and become students of that Word, and obey the divine instruction. The promise is that they shall walk in the path of truth and be free and gain life abundant and eternal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The path of truth leads us up to the great fact that the kingdom of God is begun since the year 1914. The invisible Christ has begun his reign. The great truth which Jesus told the Roman governor that he (Jesus Christ) came to bear witness unto, was that he was God’s anointed King, and that his kingdom was not of the wicked world or organization that has controlled the earth till now, but that it was of the world to come, the new organization which God now proceeds to establish over mankind. That kingdom now prepares to restrain Satan and to free men from his powerful, oppressive organization, and to bring life and truth to our race. By that kingdom of his dear Son, -Christ Jesus, Jehovah God will lead all the teachable ones of the human family, the living and the dead, who shall be restored from the grave, into the path of truth unto eternal salvation; as it is written: “God . . . will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time. ’ ’—1 Tim. 2: 3-6.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark13"></a><a name="bookmark14"></a>JEHOVAH GRACIOUSLY GUIDES</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I must tell you how reading ‘ ‘ The Days of Daniel ’ ’ not only feasted my mind but flooded it with correlative thoughts suggested thereby. And to stop their incessant fluttering I must give them flight. So here goes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The comprehensive view expressed in this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font2"> article respecting the importance and significance of the 1260 days, the 1290 days, and the 1335 days, of Daniel’s prophecy concerning the “time of the end’’ is cogent and indisputable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">However, that which I am trying to call to your attention, while in hearty accord with the article, has to do with some important events staging at and since the end of the 1335-day period and not mentioned in said article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As clearly stated iji that article, the Cedar Point Convention held in 1922 was a notable and important event in many ways and, not least, in point of its date, since it helped to mark the end of the 1290-day period and the beginning of the 1335-day period, which ended in May, 1926.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">At </span><span class="font2">that convention, so to speak, we were unwittingly camping on comparatively new premises and confronted with a comparatively new and untried campaign. We were somewhat like drowsy and suddenly aroused “virgins’’. How graciously Jehovah God appoints our “times and seasons’’ and guides us therein! At that convention the slogan “Advertise the King and the Kingdom’’ was representatively voiced, and the echo thereof still reverberates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the year 1921, a year prior to that convention, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font2"> came out. Its advent was timely and significant, and its mission important. Its transit is phenomenal. It is significant that at that time many of the Lord’s people thought that the book was intended for children. Since then many of us have been gradually and painfully learning how childishly immature and irresponsible we then were respecting future activities. How ten-virgin-like we then were with our low-burning, smoky, untrimmed lamps! How very much many of us then needed to learn in order to be fitted to assiune the grave responsibilities of the incoming kingdom interests!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the 1335-day period from 1922 to 1926, as halfawake and fretful children many of us began to feel gropingly for our neglected lamps and thereby study our primer, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God,</span><span class="font2"> preparatory to the intelligent reception of more advanced literature soon to follow. This universal study of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp</span><span class="font2"> helped many indeed; and many others would not study it, and were not helped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font2"> added little or no light, it took up and transferred the light which the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures </span><span class="font2">had hitherto afforded us, and helped us to arise and begin a systematic trimming of our lamps. It is therefore proving a much needed help to us in our transition from the Elijah phase of our woik to the Elisha phase thereof, and from our old literature to our new. Thus for four years we were being specially prepared for the “lightning flashes’’ from the Lord in his temple, which he began to show forth since 1926 through the illuminated pages of our incoming new literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As already noted, the 1335-day period ended in 1926. Hence in that year began the never-ending time of unprecedented blessings upon God’s “holy people’’. In 1926, in the very beginning of this endless time of ecstatic kingdom joy and bliss, and augmentative thereto, the book called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font2"> came out as the precursor of more and increasing light and understanding, marking an epoch of unprecedented Bible literary production and distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font2"> was followed in 1927 by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Creation,</span><span class="font2"> in 1928 by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government,</span><span class="font2"> and in 1929 by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font2"> and  </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy.</span><span class="font2"> Never before in the history of man were sucli record-breaking books written; and their intelligent and systematic distribution is no less phenomenal. Nothing could be of more timely aid and benefit to the truth-hungry peoples of earth than the production and distribution of these instructive and helpful books; and the appreciation of them expressed in thousands of letters written and millions of copies thereof circulated is documentary evidence of a universal need for them and of their divine approval. Doubtless their mission helps to fulfil Luke 21: 14, 15.</span></p>
