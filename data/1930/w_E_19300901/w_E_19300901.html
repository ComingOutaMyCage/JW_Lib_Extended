<h3><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark4"></a>THIS JOURNAL</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">rrs SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font4">HIS journal is published for the purpose of aiding tho people to understand Jehovah’s purposes. It provides systematic Bible study in which all its readers may regularly engage. It gives announcement of tho visits made to Bible classes by traveling speakers, announces conventions, and gives reports thereof. It announces radio programs and publishes suitable Bible instruction for broadcasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font4">adheres strictly to the Bible as God’s revealed Word of Truth. It stands iirmly upon the great ransom sacriiice as the fundamental doctrine by which all doctrines arc measured. It is free from parties, sects and creeds of men. It does not assume a dogmatic attitude, but confidently invites a careful examination of its utterances in the light of the infallible Word of God. It does not indulge in controversies, and its columns are not open to personalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, the Maker of heaven and earth, and is from everlasting to everlasting; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation; that the Logos became a man; that he is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and in earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT GOD created the earth for man, and created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrongful act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JESUS was made a human being in order that ho might become the Redeemer of man; that he gave his life a sacrifice for man and thereby produced the ransom price; that Jesus the divine was raised from the dead, ascended into heaven, and presented the value of his human sacrifice as the redemptive price for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT FOR MANY CENTURIES God, through Christ, has been selecting from amongst men the members of his church, which constitutes the body of Christ; that the mission of the church is to follow in the footsteps of her Lord Chiist Jesus, grow in his likeness, give testimony to the name and purpose of Jehovah God, and ultimately be glorified with Christ Jesus in his heavenly kingdom; that Christ, Head and body, constitutes the &quot;seed of Abraham’’ through which all families of the earth shall be blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">TIIAT THE WORLD HAS ENDED; that the Lord Jesus has returned and is now present; that Jehovah has placed Christ Jesus upon his throne and now commands all nations and peoples to hear and obey him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE HOPE OF THE PEOPLES of earth is restoration to human perfection during tho reign of Christ; that the reign of Christ will afford opportunity to every man to have a fair trial for life, and those who obey will live on earth for ever in a state of happiness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CAMPAIGN WEEK</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The week of September 27 to October 5 is set aside for a special campaign to publicly distribute </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">LIGHT.</span><span class="font4"> This will mark the opening of a vigorous campaign by the army of the Lord. Together they will sing the new song. It will be a time of increased joy in the Lord. In the meantime study the books, One and Two, that you may be equipped to give an intelligent testimony concerning the message therein. A great blessing is anticipated for all who engage in this campaign because of love for Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MONEY ORDERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Enclosing coin or currency with an order for books or other publications often results in disappointment when the sender is notified that neither order nor remittance has been received by us. In. this day of disturbed financial conditions even the use of checks involves a risk. For the sender's own safety and convenience, use of the money order (either postal or express) is generally more reliable than almost any other method of remitting payment. It is well, of course, to keep each money order receipt for reference in case of loss or theft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HAS YOUR SUBSCRIPTION EXPIRED?</span></p>

Machinery used to print address on label or wrapper is so constructed that the plato bearing address is automatically &quot;dropped” from tho list at expiration.

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark11"></a>HOLY SPIRIT</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“But the advocate, the holy spirit, which the Father will send in my name he will teach you all things, and will put you in mind of all things ichich I told you.”—John 14:26,</span><span class="font5"> Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH the Father is holy. Everything he does and performs, whether by direct action or by and through an agency, is necessarily holy. God is completely and wholly devoted to that which is right, and therefore everything he does is holj<sup>r</sup> and righteous. “The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.” (Ps. 145:17) Every agency which God employs, and which is completely in accord with his will, is holy. For this reason he says to those who are in a covenant with him: “Be ye holy; for I am holy. ” (Lev. 11: 44; 1 Pet. 1:16) This article is written and published specifically to aid in the study and understanding of one to follow in the next issue. Both must be considered together.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> In the text first above quoted the pronoun “he” is used to describe the holy spirit. The enemy has seized upon this fact to confuse many by putting forth the teaching that the holy spirit is a member or one of the so-called “holy trinity”. Such conclusion is entirety unsupported by any scripture, although believed and taught by all the church denominations. The holy spirit is not a separate and distinct person, being or creature. Nor could it be property said that the holy spirit is the influence of Jehovah, because influence means to be moved or controlled by the operation of power. Jehovah possesses all power. For him to will that a thing shall be done is equivalent to that thing’s being done.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Concerning creation it is written: “And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light; and there was light.” (Gen. 1:2, 3) On that occasion the spirit of God operated in obedience to his will to create. The spirit of God therefore may be defined as the power of God in operation to accomplish his will. When he puts upon a creature his spirit and empowers that creature to do a certain or specified thing, that power operates wholly to accomplish God’s expressed purpose. When God called Moses and sent him down to Egypt the purpose was to make a name for Jehovah of and concerning his purposes toward the people, and particularly concerning his purpose to have a kingdom that would vindicate his word and name. Moses was used to foreshadow the reality to come later. Not all of the power of Jehovah was used to accomplish that end, but all the power that he did use was holy, or completely devoted to that purpose. God made Moses the leader of the Israelites, and their rebellion or refusal to do what Moses told them to do “vexed his holy spirit”. (Isa. 63:10, 12) That is to say, the Israelites did contrary to God’s will operating toward them, and their conduct was vexatious.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> God sent forth Jesus, the antitype of Moses, to accomplish his purpose, and to that end he clothed Jesus with power and authority to act in his name. He put his spirit upon Jesus to carry into operation his purposes. He disclosed to Jesus his purposes, and Jesus was the instrument or agency God used to carry out the same. The spirit of God came upon Jesus at the Jordan, and a dove was used as a symbol thereof that John might be a witness to the fact. (Matt. 3:16) That was the time that Jesus was brought forth as the spirit creature of God. The spirit of God led Jesus into the wilderness, and after Jesus’ temptation God made a covenant with him to give him the kingdom, and Jesus was then anointed with the spirit of God. (Luke 4:18) It was more than three years thereafter, and when Jesus was about to go away, that he told his disciples that he would pray his Father and that his Father would send them another helper or comforter, and it was then that Jesus disclosed to his disciples that the comforter or helper that would be sent is the holy spirit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> The Greek word that is translated “comforter” or “helper” is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">parahletos,</span><span class="font5"> and the fact that a name was thus given explains why the pronoun “he” is used to describe the holy spirit. The name </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">paraklctos </span><span class="font5">is descriptive of the operation of the holy spirit; therefore the suggestion that it is not all of the spirit or power of God, but that it is the power and authority of God which is used by the Lord as an agency for his purposes and used in this instance to help those of the church dining the absence of Jesus.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> An agency used by the Lord to help his people need not be a living creature, but God could well employ some other agency through which to accomplish</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">his will. God has put many forces into action or operation that are invisible to man, and which are powerful, such as electricity, or electrons, or vibrations, and these are used for man and for man’s benefit. This in a measure may be used as an illustration of the holy spirit. The holy spirit operates specifically in relation to the bringing forth, development and use of the new creation for the kingdom of God. The holy spirit is therefore that power of God employed by him to give revelation of an understanding of himself and his purposes to those whom he brings forth as his sons. It is also the means employed by him for communication with his begotten creatures and to give them aid, comfort and help. That power thus employed as a means of communication, revelation and help for his begotten ones, being blameless and perfect and complete, the agency used is holy, and hence properly called the ‘‘holy spirit”. By way of illustration : God might send forth a covering cloud charged with power to carry out his purposes, and his purposes would be accomplished.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> When Jesus was with his disciples he was a comforter to them. He was more than that. He was their teacher, guide, helper, exhorter, and the constant stimulator of their lives. Jesus was about to go away, and before going he was giving instruction to his disciples for their aid and comfort. Since they had become his disciples he had personally looked after their needs, and he well knew they would have further needs when he was away. He was telling them what they must do. Then he said to them: “If ye love mo, keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever.”—John 14:15, 16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> In the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version</span><span class="font5"> of the above text the word “comforter” is used; but that word is hardly adequate to convey the full meaning of what Jesus said. The demonstration of the holy spirit during the absence of Jesus was not limited to comfort or consolation, but was also employed to give energy and discipline, to make intercession for and in behalf of his disciples, and to shield and protect them, and to guide them. It was also a means of revelation and the giving to them of understanding. While Jesus was with his disciples he was not only their comforter, teacher and guide, but it was sometimes necessary for him to severely reprimand them. (Alatt. 16: 23; Luke 22: 31) God had given to Jesus these men, and during the three and a half years they were with him he was as </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">father to them and their relation to him was that of children. (John 17:4-7) When he was away they would therefore be orphans and would need help; hence Jesus said to them that he would make request of his Father, who would send to them another helper. Jesus then promised them that they should not always be left in this condition as orphans, but that in some future time he would come for them. ‘ ‘ I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.” (John 14:18) The marginal reading of this text is “orphans”, instead of “comfortless”, and the text is likewise rendered in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott.</span><span class="font5"> Until the return of the Lord, then, his true followers would be orphans; but would not be without help, because another helper would be sent. That helper or comforter, as Jesus told them, would be the holy spirit; and he said: “He [the holy spirit J shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.” It therefore appears to be clear that the comforter, helper, or holy spirit, is the agency, power and authority sent forth by Jehovah in the name of Jesus to do in the absence of Jesus what Jesus would do for his disciples if personally present with them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>9</sup> In the beginning God produced life according to his purpose. He set a force into operation and did not need to give his personal direction and supervision to every movement which brought forth life. That appears to be the manner employed by him generally in creation. A special act was performed, however, in the creation of man, which act was done by Jehovah by and through his Son the Logos. In the new creation it is God who begets or brings forth by the operation of his will and his Word. (Jas. 1:18) Then he sends out his spirit to help, comfort and aid the begotten ones. Jesus Christ is the Head over and has preeminence in all things concerning all the spirit-begotten ones. God deals with these through Christ Jesus, and therefore the helper sent from God is sent in the name of Christ Jesus. This helper is also called “the spirit of truth”, sent forth by the Father at the request of his Son to operate for the benefit of his spirit-begotten ones. Concerning this, Jesus said: “Howbeit when he, the spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you. All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.” (John 16:13-15) In just what manner the comforter, helper, holy spirit, or spirit of truth, operates is not revealed. It is revealed, however, that it is the power and authority from God sent forth in the name of Christ Jesus to operate for and in behalf of the spirit-begotten ones during the absence of Christ Jesus.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> By way of illustration: It is observed that a power plant generates a great amount of electricity. A certain portion of that power is directed into a motor which operates exclusively and wholly for the purpose of moving a machine. No man sees that force or power, but he secs the results thereof.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> All power resides in Jehovah God. He has committed the operation of that power and authority to his beloved Son. A specific part or operation thereof is set apart for the exclusive use and wholly devoted to the help, aid, comfort and instruction of the disciples of Christ Jesus, and this helper is called the holy spirit. It is not all the power of God, but it is from God, therefore God’s power. Being from God and being devoted specifically to one thing it is given a name, to wit, helper or holy spirit. The spirit of God was upon Jesus when he spoke to his disciples, but that which is called the comforter or helper or holy spirit was to be sent and was sent after his departure from the earth. In his absence Jesus would not be employed with every detail concerning the life and affairs of the church; but the holy spirit, sent forth in his name, and coming in contact with those who had the desire to be in harmony with God, would have to do with these details of directing and aiding the church.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> Here is a Scriptural illustration of the point under consideration: In the church at Antioch there were certain men teaching and serving their brethren. “And while they were serving the Lord and fasting, the holy spirit said, ‘Separate to me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I called them.’ Then having fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them forth. They, therefore, having been sent out bj<sup>r</sup> the holy spirit, went down to Seleu-cia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.” (Acts 13:2-4, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott)</span><span class="font5"> These men were devoted to God and were waiting upon God and doing such work as was plainly before them and without doubt were earnestly desiring and seeking to know and do the Lord’s will. Then, without any direct word from Christ Jesus, the holy spirit directed or led these men to do a certain thing. By this we understand that, these faithful men being all of one mind and all desiring to do God’s will, the holy spirit moved upon each one and moved them to the same conclusion and they recognized that they were guided by the holy spirit. It was not the will of God that Jesus should do directly these things for his followers while he was in heaven, but that the other helper, the holy spirit, should aid them; and this is what came to pass.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> Another like operation or demonstration of the holy spirit is set forth in the fifteenth chapter of the Acts of the apostles. As there stated, a conference was held at Jerusalem, and it resulted in the men of that conference sending a messenger to the church at other points. They realized that they were directed in so doing by the operation of the holy spirit. All being of one desire and one will to do God’s will, the power and authority operated upon their minds in the name of Christ Jesus and directed them what to do. The men of that conference wrote letters and sent them by messengers, and in these letters they said: “It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you, with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. For it seemed good to the holy spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things.” (Acts 15: 25, 26, 28) As members of the church these men realized that the Lord was not telling them directly what to do, but that they were guided, helped and directed by the power of God, and that holy power moved the heart and mind of each one devoted to the Lord to do what was done. That power and authority sent forth and put in operation by Jehovah God in the name of Christ Jesus was ready to operate upon the mind of each one who was ready to receive instruction and guidance. The result shows that this is the correct conclusion as to the operation of the holy spirit on that occasion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> In the days of the apostles and others who were anointed with them there was a unity of action, which unity of action was guided by the holy spirit. After the death of the apostles and the teachers in the early church the truth was greatly obscured by Satan. Then followed a long period in which there was no connected action in the church as a body, but the holy spirit operated upon the mind of each individual follower of Christ Jesus who earnestly sought to know and to do the will of God. Such kept the unity of the spirit, but there was no unity of action of all the members of the body made up of God’s consecrated people on the earth.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> While the apostles were in the flesh the Lord began a work of bringing the church to “the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God”. To this end the Lord gave some for apostles, and some for prophets (teachers or speakers), and some for evangelists, and shepherds; and the reason for so doing is stated, to wit: “For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: from whom the whole body fitly' joined together, and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.”—Eph. 4:12-16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1G</sup>It may properly be said that this work of bringing the saints to a unity of faith and knowledge did not progress during the dark ages, and this because the apostles and special instructors were taken away. The holy spirit, however, operated to guide the individuals that were devoted to God. The teachers in the churches became worldly, yet a few held on to the faith once delivered to the apostles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>u</sup> With the beginning of the second presence of the Lord, approximately A. D. 1875, there was a change in the work. The restitution of the truth there began and progressed. The work which was begun at Pentecost was again taken up, and continued after the beginning of the Lord’s second presence, looking to the bringing of the church to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of Christ Jesus. The church is thus pictured as growing up from childhood to manhood or maturity. This corresponds with what is written in 1 Corinthians 13:11: “ When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child.” The unity mentioned did not exist completely in the days of the apostles, although it began there. It surely did not exist during the “dark ages”. We should expect progress in this direction, however, to a completion when Christ Jesus began ‘to prepare the way before the Lord’. During that period of time the fundamental truths were restored to the church, and then suddenly or straightway Christ Jesus came to his temple. Then and there began the work of gathering the consecrated together. A separating and judgment work there began, and progressed, and the approved ones were taken into the temple and into the joy of the Lord. This work must of necessity continue until the complete number is selected, approved, and taken into the temple and made members of the ‘elect servant ’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Is there any evidence that the unity of which the apostle wrote is now practically an accomplished fact? The evidence seems quite conclusive that the gathering of these members of the body into the temple is almost complete, if not entirely so. The evidence shows that a great separating work has been going on since 1918 and that probably that separating work is not entirely completed, but that those who are gathered into the temple are in this condition of unity. Just how long a period of time the Lord will use after coming to his temple to complete the work of separating and the judging of those who have agreed to do his will is not disclosed, but it seems certain that it must continue until all the members are selected and the unity is complete. Should any that have been chosen become unfaithful and fall away, surely the Lord would supply another to fill that vacancy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> The evidence is conclusive that the Lord is now in his temple and that there is a unity of faith and knowledge among those who are in the temple. There is now a clearer vision of God’s purposes revealed to the temple class. To be sure, the church does not now have all knowledge, and in fact never will have all knowledge, but will at all times be inquiring in the temple of the Lord. There is, however, at this time a unity of knowledge concerning God’s organization, the enemy’s organization, the setting up of the kingdom, and the work that is now to be done by God’s anointed people. The apostle, in speaking of this, employs these words: “For the complete qualification of the saints for the work of service, in order to the building up of the body of the Anointed one.”—Eph. 4:12, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> There is certainly now a unity of the church concerning the work and service that must be done, and the temple class is doing that work with joy. It also seems quite clear that the church is now doing the final work of witnessing to the name of God just preceding the fall of the enemy and his organization, and that the body members are serving according to the direction of the Head, Christ Jesus. With all of these, therefore, there is a unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ADVOCATE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> An advocate is one that makes intercession for another and acts as comforter for the one for whom he advocates. After Jesus ascended on high and took his place at the right hand of Jehovah he then and there became the advocate for the sons of God in the flesh. Because of the weakness of each one, the tendency is to sin; and hence each one needs an advocate. Concerning this it is written: “My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.” (1 John 2:1) In addition to what Jesus would do in heaven as an advocate for the consecrated, he promised his disciples that he would pray his Father to send to them another comforter, or advocate. The word </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">parakletos,</span><span class="font5"> comforter, or helper, also means advocate; and this helper would advocate for the church during the absence of Jesus from his followers. This advocate, or comforter, is the holy spirit. It may properly be said, then, that Jesus served in the presence of his Father as advocate for the church and that the holy spirit served as advocate on earth in behalf of the church. Thus there operated for the church a two-fold advocacy; and this conclusion is fully supported by the words of the apostle in Romans 8:26 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Diagloti).</span><span class="font5"> “In like manner also the spirit assists our weakness; for we do not know what we should pray for as we ought; but the spirit itself intercedes with unspoken groans.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> The text last above quoted undoubtedly refers to the work of the holy spirit in the minds and hearts of the sons of God in the flesh, creating in such the desire to be wholly and completely devoted to God. An advocate is an intercessor, and thus the holy spirit intercedes in behalf of the one earnestly desiring to serve Jehovah. All who responded to the call to the high or heavenly kingdom, and who are accepted by Jehovah, arc accepted in “the beloved One”, and each individually has his standing alone in the beloved One. (Eph. 1:6) Because of the imperfection of the chosen ones while tabernacling in the flesh they could be acceptable and are acceptable by God only in the beloved One, Christ Jesus. 'While Jesus was absent from them, and while he is engaged in ‘preparing the way before the Lord’ and before he comes to his tern-plc, the holy spirit operates as an advocate, helper and comforter of and for all that have responded to the call for the kingdom. But when the Lord comes to his temple and gathers his approved ones into the temple, is there any further need for the office of the holy spirit as a helper or advocate? If not, then the advocacy of the holy spirit would there cease. Jesus, being in the temple and with his chosen ones, would aet for them directly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> When Jesus was on the earth he had no advocate, because God dealt directly with him. When Jesus gathers those of the temple to himself, and they are clothed with the garments of salvation, they are also brought under the robe of righteousness. (Isa. 61:10) The temple class then becomes a part of the ‘elect servant’ of God. (Isa. 42:1-6) “The servant” is Jehovah’s special appointee, and in the mouth of his “servant” God puts his words, and to the “servant” class he gives special protection and directs them to do a certain work while he plants the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth. (Isa. 51:16) It would seem that there would be no necessity for the “servant” to have an advocate such as the holy spirit, because the “servant” is in direct communication with Jehovah and as Jehovah’s instrument, and Christ Jesus acts for the entire body.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">24</span><span class="font5"> “The servant” is anointed to do a specific work. “The servant” is made up of Christ Jesus the Head, the resurrected saints, and the called and chosen ones on the earth who have been brought into the temple and who have entered into the joy of the Lord. Individually those of the remnant on earth must have rheir standing before God in the beloved One Christ Jesus, and the beloved One is their advocate. Being in the temple, however, there would seem to be no good reason why there should be an advocacy in their behalf by the holy spirit, since the Lord is now with them. In other words their days of ‘orphanage’ have ended. Jesus said: ‘I will not leave you as orphans, but I will come to you [again].’ (John 14:18) Now he has come and gathered the temple class to himself, and these have been anointed of the Lord. It is “the servant” with which Jehovah is now dealing, and Christ Jesus stands for the “servant” in his entirety. It is written: “Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth.” (Bom. 8: 33) Jehovah is the One that approves or judges his “servant”. When the temple class is gathered the administration of the holy spirit as an advocate, it seems, would be at an end. If one is of the remnant, chosen and anointed, then he is in the secret place of the Most High. By reason of being in Christ and under the special supervision of the Head of the temple, Christ Jesus is his sole advocate. As long as the chosen one abides in the temple he is in the secret place of the Most High and therefore in the place of security.—p<sub>s</sub>. 91:1-11.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SPECIAL OVERSIGHT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> It is written that when the Lord comes to his temple for judgment he is accompanied by his holy angels. (Matt. 25:31) Without doubt he uses these holy angels to gather his faithful ones into the temple. “And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet; and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.” (Matt. 24:31) It must be that these holy angels are clothed with power and authority from Christ Jesus to have special supervision over those on earth who are of the elect “servant” class. As above stated, when the disciples were gathered at Jerusalem it was the holy spirit as their helper that moved them to take action in sending messengers to their brethren. (Acts 15: 24-28) But it seems certain that when Jesus came to his temple and began his work of judgment he would direct his holy angels to take the necessary action to cause the separation of the disapproved from the approved ones, and would use his angels to bear messages to them to direct the approved ones as to what to do. (Matt. 13:41) It is the power and authority proceeding from Jehovah God by and through Christ Jesus to accomplish this work; but the angels are there for this purpose, and it is not the demonstration of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">parakletos</span><span class="font5"> or holy spirit as a helper that directs men to do the separating work. If the holy spirit as a helper were directing the work, then there would be no good reason for employing the angels.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> It also seems quite clear that when the remnant is gathered into the secret place of the Most High it is the angels of the Lord that are charged with certain work of looking after and safeguarding the interests of these faithful ones. “He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.” (Ps. 91:11) The “servant” class is formed for service. Instead of the “servant’s” being moved into action by the operation of the holy spirit as a helper, the Scriptures seem clearly to teach that the Lord directs his angels what to do and that they aet under the supervision of the Lord in directing the remnant on earth concerning the course of action to take.—Rev. 8:1-7.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>27</sup> From 1922 forward there has been a work done by the church the like of which was never done before. It could hardly be said that such witness work was brought about in the same manner that the disciples were directed to send messengers to their brethren at Antioch; but rather that the Lord Jesus Christ, the Head of “the servant”, acting by and through his holj’ angels, has directed and is directing that work. It was the holy spirit that operated upon the minds of men in the early church to take certain action; but now the Lord Jesus himself has returned, is in his temple, and, acting by and through his holy angels, puts it into the mind and heart of the remnant class to take positive action and to do a certain work; and this work has been going on, especially since 1922.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HELPER FOR WHOM?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> It might be said that the holy spirit as a helper, comforter, or advocate, has operated on earth for the benefit of all who have been begotten of the holy spirit; but that conclusion does not seem to be supported by the words of Jesus. In speaking of praying the Father to send the helper, or holy spirit, he was addressing himself to those whom he had invited into the covenant for the kingdom, and the presumption is that they had responded to this invitation. Therefore it is reasonable to conclude that the holy spirit, or helper, would operate for and in behalf of only these.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>29</sup> Jesus had just told his disciples how necessary it would be for them to bring forth the fruits of the kingdom, and then he adds: “I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. [But] when he, the spirit of truth is eome, he will guide you into all truth.” (John 16:12, 13) These words hardly seem to apply to those who do not respond to the call for the kingdom. Those who will make up the “great company” class are a comfortless class and are called the “tribulation” class. They have never responded to the call to the kingdom, and have not been taken into the covenant, and it hardly seems reasonable that the holy spirit would act as an advocate for these, but rather that the administration of the holy spirit, as a helper or comforter, has been for the benefit of only those who have responded to the call and who therefore have been in line for the kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> When the Lord appears at his temple for judgment he begins judgment with the house of God; which must mean, with those who are at least in line for the kingdom or house of God by reason of the fact that they have responded to the call. (1 Pet. 4:17) During that examination and judgment at the temple both the “faithful and wise servant” and the “evil servant” are made manifest. It must be that those making up both these classes had responded to the call for the kingdom and that one class shows a proper condition of heart while the other shows an improper heart condition. It seems quite clear that it is during that time of judgment that the following scripture is fulfilled: “The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity.” (Matt. 13: 41) Those gathered out must have been in line for the kingdom, otherwise this scripture could not apply. They have looked forward to the coming of the Lord and to sharing with him his kingdom, but have not unselfishly devoted themselves to the Lord; and having a selfish motive and an improper condition of heart, they are gathered out. Surely the holy spirit would no longer advocate for such; and it is equally certain that the Lord would not be advocate for them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>31</sup> Briefly summed up, then, these are the points here attempted to be made, to wit: That the holy spirit of God sent forth as the helper, comforter cud advocate has looked after the affairs of the church in the absence of Christ Jesus; that such helper or advocate has been the means of communication between the Lord and the called ones who have responded to the call, and the means of revelation and instruction and understanding of such during the absence of Christ Jesus (Eph. 1:13; 4:30; 1 Thess. 4:8); that when the Lord comes to his temple for examination and judgment all those that have responded to the call must be the first ones that are brought to judgment, and those that are chosen and brought into the temple have no further need for the administration of the holy spirit as a helper or advocate because Christ Jesus himself is present with them and is their advocate and helper; and that when the temple class is complete, and the separation is complete, and all are gathered together unto Christ, whether on the other side or on this side the vail, then the operation of the holy spirit as a helper would cease. If this conclusion is correct, then the question of importance arises, to wit: What relationship, if any, has this to the revelation of the “man of sin, the son of perdition”, foretold by the inspired words of the apostle? the question to be considered in a subsequent issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3">[ Thirty-minute</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">VERY right doctrine, teaching, principle and law proceeds from God. Some of these principles and laws govern and regulate nature, procreation, the heavens, the seasons, climatic conditions, and other inanimate creations of God. But there are certain doctrines, teachings, principles and laws that are necessary to be believed and practiced toward God and our fellow men in order to have God’s approval and blessing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">now</span><span class="font5"> and his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">final</span><span class="font5"> gift of everlasting life. These latter are laid down in the Bible, and are what we refer to as God's truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among men there is a great difference of opinion as to what is truth; that is, what God requires us to believe and practice in order that we may be pleasing to him. Repeatedly docs the Bible tell us that God’s law, that is, his will expressed, is the truth. In John 17:17, Jesus saidSanctify them through thy truth: thy </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">word</span><span class="font5"> is truth.” To this agrees the Prophet David, who says:“Thy law is the truth.” (Ps. 119:142) Again, in verse 151 of the same psalm we read: “All thy commandments are truth.” Thus we can see that God’s truth consists of all those laws, rules and requirements laid down in his Word, which men must believe, teach and obey in order to be pleasing to Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Jesus stood before Pilate, he said: “Every one that is of the truth hcarcth my voice.” Pilate replied, saying, “What is truth?” Evidently there were so many conflicting doctrines and teachings as to what was required of men that Pilate could not decide which was correct; hence his question, “What is truth?” Because of the multiplicity of creeds and sects, and of confused and conflicting ideas of government and morals, millions of people have asked the same question that Pilate did: “What is truth?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is the most important question in existence today, because the future everlasting life and happiness of each individual depends on knowing and obeying the truth. The only dependable source of information is the Bible. Its information is reliable, because Jehovah God is its author. The reason why there are so many different opinions as to what is the truth is that men do not go to the Bible for their information. They accept without investigation the opinions of other men, or else lean to their </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">own</span><span class="font5"> understanding in the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There has been opposition to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">God’s</span><span class="font5"> truth ever since Satan tempted Eve in Eden. The reason for this opposition is that Satan is the enemy of God, and an enemy of truth and righteousness. He it is who misrepresents God’s truth, and blinds the minds of the people to its beauty; and his usual method of deception is to substitute something else for the truth and make it look plausible by using lies. Whatever Satan has-substituted for the TRUTH is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">always</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">lie.</span><span class="font5"> Jesus said of Satan, in John 8:44, that he “abode not in</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">radio lecture]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it”. Since Jesus’ words are true, it follows that all lies are of Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In misrepresenting God and his truth Satan uses men as his instruments. He uses selfish, cruel and conscienceless men; nevertheless he chooses these from among those who are influential and educated and who hold prominent positions, and hence wield a large influence on others. This serves his purpose best, and aids in the work of deception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The correct thought is that no matter how prominent and influential a person may be who opposes the truth, he is Satan’s agent in so doing, whether he is aware of the fact or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s will, determination or purpose, in creating the earth was that it should be the everlasting home of a perfect race of human creatures. In furtherance of this purpose he created Adam and Eve, and told them to multiply and increase and replenish the earth. It was further his will that none but obedient humans should live on the earth; hence he tested Adam to see if he would be obedient. He told Adam that if he disobeyed he would surely die, which clearly implied that if he did not disobey he would surely live. The penalty was to be death, absolute death, and not life in any place or condition. In addition to this, the earth was to exist forever, as we are plainly told in Ecclesiastes 1: 4 and in other texts also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These various features of God’s purpose, or will, are what is called God’s truth. It was God’s truth at that time, and it is his truth yet. He has not changed his mind, and he will not let Satan hinder or thwart his purpose. The earth is, in God’s due time, to become the everlasting abode of perfect and sinless human creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God created and placed Lucifer, a wonderfully wise and beautiful spirit creature, over Adam and Eve and their posterity to protect and guard them from unseen dangers. Lucifer allowed ambition to creep into his heart, as recorded in Isaiah 14:12-14, and plotted to get control of Adam and Eve and, through them, all their posterity. To do this he must alienate them from the service of God. He set about to do this, and the method used was to lie to them about God; in other words, to misrepresent God’s truth. It was there and then that opposition to God’s truth began, and Satan was its instigator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Obsessing and speaking through a serpent, Satan said to the woman, “Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?” The woman answered that they were allowed to eat of all but one, and that God had said they would surely die if they ate of that one. The selfish, wicked, cruel and conscienceless Satan then lied to Eve and deceived her. He said (Gen. 3:4, 5), “Ye shall </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font5"> surely die: for</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font5">doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, ... ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.” Satan’s lies succeeded; for in verse 6 we read: “When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof and did eat, and gave unto her husband with her; and he did eat.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There were two lies in Satan’s statement: The first one was, “Ye shall not surely die.” The second one was, “Ye shall be as gods.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now notice the subtle deceptions in these lies. Put the two lies together, remembering that a god is an invisible spirit person. The two lies meant that if Eve ate of the forbidden fruit she would become as an invisible spirit creature and would not die. It meant that if she should cat of the fruit, and die, it would not really be death; in fact she would be more alive than ever if she became like a god. Satan’s opposition to God’s truth deceived the woman into believing the lie.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From that day to this Satan has kept that lie before the people. Today the majority of professing Christians believe it. That lie of Satan’s is the basis of the idea that man has an immortal soul that cannot die. That lie is the basis of every funeral sermon that instructs the hearers that their dead friend is more alive than ever. So the two false doctrines of human immortality and that the dead are more alive than ever, which oppose and blind people to God’s truth, had their origin in Eden; and their father was the Devil. Upon these two false doctrines is built another false doctrine called ‘eternal torment for the wicked’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God told Adam that the penalty for sins was death. Satan taught that people do not really die, and that therefore it follows that if there is an everlasting punishment it ntust be in a conscious state somewhere; and so eternal torment was hatched up and foisted on the people, and it has been the greatest money-getter of all doctrines that have ever been preached. It is almost unbelievable, but it is true, that people will put more into the collection box to hear eternal torment preached than they will to hear the good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Under these false doctrines and misrepresentations, God’s truth was submerged; and for millenniums the people, except a very few, some of whom are named in the eleventh chapter of Hebrews, were worshiping heathen gods, gods of stone and of silver and of gold and of wood, besides beasts and reptiles. Then God’s due time arrived to give to the world some further enlightenment as to what his purpose was; and in harmony with his original purpose he sent his Son Jesus into the world as his representative to announce </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">his truth</span><span class="font5"> to the blinded and deceived world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Jesus came into the world, we are told that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">he was a </span><span class="font5">great light and that the world was in dark</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ness. </span><span class="font5">This means that the Devil had so obscured God’s truth that the people had lost all idea of it. So Jesus said, in John 18:37: “To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.’’ Yes; Jesus came to bring God’s truth into the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But what did Jesus preach? Did he preach eternal torment or human immortality? Did be tell the people that when they died they would be more alive than ever? Not a word of it. But he did tell the people of a coming kingdom. He never missed an opportunity to mention that kingdom. He taught that the kingdom would come in the future, and taught the disciples to pray for it. He also taught a resurrection of the dead. He even said that the hour was coming when all in the graves, both good and evil, would hear his voice and come forth from the tomb.—John 5:28, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This coming kingdom, and a coming resurrection of the dead, is God’s truth; and it was in violent conflict with the traditions of men which the religions leaders taught at that time. What was the result? The answer is, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">opposition.</span><span class="font5"> Who was it that opposed the truth? The answer is that it was a class of people who believed in and claimed to worship Jehovah God, and who claimed Io be looking for and expecting the coming of Messiah. This should be borne in mind, because it is usually the religious leaders who persecute those who are announcing God’s truth. Even in our day opposition to God’s truth comes from religious leaders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But why should these religious leaders, who claim to worship the same God, persecute and oppose those ■who are announcing the coming kingdom, especially when these leaders themselves believe in a coming kingdom? The answer is that they are so indoctrinated in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">creeds</span><span class="font5"> of Satan and in the lies which he has taught, and have been so convinced that these are taught in the Bible, that they get angry when told that such is not the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">False doctrines beget in these men pride, bigotry, prejudice and self-esteem; and so their minds are closed to everything that contradicts their creed. While they believe in a “God”, it is not the God of the Bible. Theirs is a cruel, relentless “God” who delights in tormenting people. They have believed in and taught about such a ’’God” until they </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">love. hi;n. </span><span class="font5">They </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">love</span><span class="font5"> the idea of eternal torment, because they have the spirit of their master, Satan. While they believe in a coming kingdom, they believe that they arc to convert the world first and that then Christ will come and take possession of the earth after they have, made it fit for him. God’s truth says that Christ will come for the purpose of converting the world. God’s truth shows that men will fail to convert it, and that it will be in a worse condition when Christ comes than before. This is plainly stated in 2 Timothy 3:1-8, Luke 18: 8, and other texts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Jesus’ day the religious leaders were merciless in their opposition and persecution. Their false teachings begat in them the spirit of their master, Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is only God’s truth that sanctifies. Error or falsehood never sanctifies; but they do beget cruelty, hatred, and even murder. The professedly pious Pharisees, with wicked, diabolical murder in their hearts, plotted to kill Jesus. They hired assassins to waylay and kill him; they tried to catch him in his words; and finally they hired Judas to betray him, and then hired witnesses to swear to lies to secure his conviction. Then when Jesus writhed in agony on the cross, they egged the people on to revile and sneer at him. The trouble with those religious leaders was that they were rooted and grounded in Satan's lies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who have God's truth never persecute. The truth does not need such a defense. It is only error that seeks by persecution, threats and death to silence those who oppose it. Any cause that has to be supported by persecution, threats, or tyranny and lies, is of Satan and does not have divine approval, and is always in opposition to God’s truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The real enemy and opposer of God’s truth is Satan. For six thousand years he has controlled people’s minds and directed their thoughts into channels which are antagonistic to the truth of Jehovah God, until these false teachings and misrepresentations have taken a definite form and are called by the name of “orthodoxy”. The time is here when the truth of God is sneered at because it is “unorthodox”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let anyone declare the advent of the kingdom of Christ, or tell of the blessings which will be the portion of the people when the kingdom is established, and his statements will provoke anger, resentment and persecution on the part of those who are considered leaders in religious circles. The great political and financial leaders also resent such teachings. Why is this so? The answer is that instinctively they feel that if such a kingdom of righteousness ever is established on the earth, political and financial plots will come to an end and profits from such sources will cease. The religious leaders instinctively feel that if such a kingdom is established, their false teachings will not stand the light of the truth, and thus they will be shown up and disgraced. It is no wonder that Satan opposes the truth of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now the question occurs, Will God allow Satan and his agents to continue to suppress the truth and to oppose those who publish it? The answer is, No. The Scriptures tell us of a time when Satan is to be bound that he may deceive the nations no more. He will be bound for a thousand years. That thousand years is the length of the reign of Christ. Why is Satan to be bound? The answer is, That he may deceive the nations no more. That means that he will not be permitted to oppose God's truth during that thousand years. Neither will his agents be permitted to oppose during that time. God’s truth will be published everywhere on earth then, and all the people will come to know the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1 Timothy </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font5">: 3, 4 we read: “For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.” The time to announce God’s truth to all the world is now at hand, and the work of announcing it has begun. For several years the message that Christ’s second advent is an accomplished fact has been going out all over the earth. That is one feature of divine truth that is now due to be known. Another feature is that Christ has begun the work of destroying Satan’s empire on earth; that this work of destruction began in 1914, and will soon be completed in the battle of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The destruction of Satan’s empire is necessary, in order to remove all hindrances to the free announcement of the fact of the presence of the Lord and the establishment of his kingdom. The destruction of Satan’s empire will be followed immediately by the binding of Satan for a thousand years; and then every hindrance will be removed, and God’s truth will speedily flood the earth. Speaking of this, the Prophet Isaiah, chapter 11, verse 9, says: “The earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.” Jeremiah also, in chapter 31, verses 33, 34, says: “I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; . . . they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.” These promises are a part of God’s truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Good men will rejoice in the fact that everyone is to get the blessings of life, liberty, health, peace and happiness in the near future. But not only are there many people who oppose the announcement of these coming blessings, but the Scriptures assure us that they will resist the truth when it is going out and will die the second death for their obstinacy and resistance. It is a serious thought to contemplate; namely, that there will be some people so wicked at heart, so selfish, so wilful and stubborn, that they will resist the Lord when he purposes to bring blessings to everybody. The Bible mentions such resisters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Acts 7:51 Stephen reproved the resisters of his time. His words are: “Ye stiffnecked, and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the holy spirit: as your fathers did, so do ye.” And they stoned Stephen to death for telling them of their resistance. Again, in 2 Timothy 3: 8 Paul mentions a class who are ever learning and never able to come to a knowledge of the truth. He says: “As Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason why people resist the truth is that they arc wicked, selfish, and cruel. Error never sanctifies. False doctrines, false principles, and false laws have the effect of hardening the hearts and searing the consciences, and making people selfish, wicked, and cruel. Such do not want to have their false doctrines and false principles and laws exposed, even if the exposure brings blessings to thousands of millions of the race; and hence they will resist even unto second death, or everlasting destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bible gives the reasons for their opposition. In </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font5">Timothy 6:5, after mentioning the resisters, Paul says: “Men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth. ’ ’ In Romans 1:18 Paul mentions some who “hold the truth in unrighteousness’’, and in verse 25 he mentions some who “changed the truth of God into a lie’’. In 1 Corinthians 13: 6 he alludes to some who rejoice in iniquity and do not rejoice in the truth. It is the great leaders who get into this condition where they delight in evil teachings and resist the truth. They have taught false doctrines so long that their hearts have become hardened against the truth. They have oppressed the people so long that their hearts have become hardened to their cries of distress, and seared against every righteous principle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 2 Thessalonians 2:10-12 Paul mentions this class of resisters in these words: “They received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: that they all might be [condemned] who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. ’ ’ This text suggests that this class of wilful resisters will be condemned by Jehovah God. This condemnation is mentioned again in 2 Thessalonians 1: 9 as follows: ‘ ‘ Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.” This everlasting destruction is annihilation. It means that they will forever cease to exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is another class of resisters of the truth who will suffer the same punishment; namely, second death, or destruction. This is a class who hear the truth and accept it, and later turn against it and become resisters and opposers. These are mentioned in Hebrews 6:4-6, as a class who have been once enlightened and have tasted the good word of God and been made partakers of his holy spirit; and then the apostle goes on to say that ‘ if they fall away they can never be renewed again unto repentance, because they crucify unto themselves again the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These are mentioned again, in Hebrews 10:26, as follows: “For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation, that shall devour the adversaries.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These opposers who once had the truth and were associated with others who had the truth are like Judas, traitors to the Lord and to his cause. They are mentioned in 2 Peter 2:1, 2 as follows: “There shall be false teachers </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">among you,</span><span class="font5"> who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction [which means second death]. And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus we can see that the Scriptures lead us to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">expect</span><span class="font5"> opposition to the truth. Of course it is reasonable that Satan will resist the establishment of Christ's kingdom. He will resist and oppose the followers of the Lord who are announcing that kingdom. All the Lord’s people expect this, and are not in the least surprised when the opposition and resistance takes the form of persecution and misrepresentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the past Satan has succeeded to a large extent in his efforts to oppose. But now the Lord has taken his power and has begun his reign: and the Scriptures assure us that all the efforts of Satan and his minions in opposing the truth will fail. The Lord’s people have the assurance that this fight between the forces of evil and error and those of truth and righteousness will culminate in certain victory for the Lord and his truth. The binding of Satan will occur soon; and this will mean the restraint of all opposition, by Satan, angels, or men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s truth is soon to be known to all his creatures; and it will bring to the human family indescribable blessings, among which will be deliverance from Satan and his wicked and cruel human agents, and the gift of everlasting life, with all its blessings of peace, health and prosperity to all the willing and obedient. God’s last act of mercy to the wilful opposers will be to destroy them in instantaneous death. After this merciful destruction, righteousness, peace, joy, health, liberty and happiness will be the portion of all the race right here on earth.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark14"></a><a name="bookmark15"></a>BENEFITS OF AN IDEAL GOVERNMENT</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">(Fifteen-minute radio lecture]</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font5">N IDEAL government is an individual’s conception of a perfect government. Should inquiry be made it would be found that there are nearly as many ideals as there are individuals. The reason for this diversity of opinion lies in the faet that every one is selfish and the views of all are more or less colored by self-interest or the interests of individuals and projects that are near and dear to them. It is evident that a selfish person cannot have a proper conception of a perfect government, because he would be unable to properly consider the interests of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An individual’s conception of a perfect government may be approximately understood by noting the form of government which he advocates, or which he chooses, sustains and approves by his vote. Jesus expressed this principle of judgment when he said, ‘By their fruits ye shall know them. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Applying this principle, wc can readily see that the ideal government held in the mind of a militarist is one where the masses are controlled and held in subjection by military force. The ideal of the financier is a government where capital is recognized as the chief factor, and large returns upon investments are guaranteed by </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">legislation.</span><span class="font5"> Opposed to the latter is the labor conception of government, wherein labor is recognized by </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">legislation</span><span class="font5"> as the important factor. Then there is the conception of the religionist, who considers that God has specially appointed him to supervise and control the habits and customs of others, and seeks to influence legislation to that end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to these there are the high-tariff and the no-tariff ideals; the socialistic and the communistic ideals; also the agricultural and industrial blocs with their ideals; the wets and drys with their ideals; the pacifists, monarchists, fascisti, suffragettes, and others too numerous to mention, all with different ideals of government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It will be noticed, however, that every one of these ideals is built upon and sustained by force, either the strong arm of militarism or the strong arm of legislation, which is used to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">compel</span><span class="font5"> certain classes to submit to the dictum of other classes. In doing this, those in power ignore the equality of men and the fundamental right and privilege of each person to have equal opportunity with every other person. Those in power invariably regard themselves as a sort of superior race and arrogate to themselves the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">right</span><span class="font5"> to rule over others, and ofttimes boldly proclaim this right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They overlook the fact, stated by Paul, that “God . . . made the world and all things therein, ... he is Lord of heaven and earth, . . . and hath made of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">one blood</span><span class="font5"> all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth’’. (Acts 17:24-26) They overlook the further fact that when God gave Adam dominion that dominion was ‘over the fish of the sea, over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth’. God, however, did not give Adam a dominion over his fellow men, and no man has a right to such dominion. God made man a free moral agent, and he must render an account to God for the use of that free moral agency, and not to any man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Right here is where the prohibition law can be criticised. Drinking to excess is a sin, an injury to oneself and to others, but God has never delegated to any man or set of men the right to dictate to others what they shall eat, drink or wear. The rule of force is not an ideal government; and since men are selfish as a result of the curse of sin and death, it is impossible for them to set up an ideal or perfect government, or even to approximate one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An ideal government is one in which all the citizens are free and equal; where justice, liberty and the right of free speech and assembly are guaranteed to all; where every man is protected in these rights and no person will attempt to abridge those rights. Only a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">perfect</span><span class="font5"> government would be an ideal government to an honest person, who loves his fellow men and who loves righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such a government, according to the Bible, is now being set up on the earth by Jehovah, the living God. That government is called the kingdom of God. Christ will be God’s representative on the throne, and will reign in righteousness. It will be a reign of one thousand years. (Rev. 20:6) Great numbers of scriptures set forth the benefits of that government. In order that it may be established in all the earth, it is necessary to destroy the present selfish governments of earth; hence in Daniel 2:44 we read: “In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever. ” In 1 Corinthians 15:25-28 we read of this government, under Christ, these words: “He must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. . . . And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This new government will be a world-wide government, instead of scores of different governments, all trying to get an advantage of one another. With only one government under the whole heaven, wars will automatically end, as there will be no other selfish governments to fight. All questions like free trade, tariff, and quarrels over international boundary lines will automatically end also; and this will do away with border patrols and police, as well as passports and the annoyance and expense of such to travelers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It will be conducive to peace, because international jealousies will disappear. Multitudes of other vexing questions, which arc a product of selfish interests, will for ever disappear, because the righteous government will be in control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here are quoted a few of the many texts which tell </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">the benefits of that perfect government, which will be the ideal government of Jehovah God, the unselfish </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">One.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Isaiah 9:6-9 we read: “Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder. ... Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end.” What a stupendous thought is wrapped up in those words, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“no end”</span><span class="font5"> of peace, in his government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Again, in Isaiah 2:4, of the Head of that government we read: “He shall judge among the nations, . . . and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.” Thus will be removed one of the worst curses that ever blighted God’s green earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Still again, in Psalm 72:1-4 we read of that kingdom as follows: “Give the king thy judgments, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">0 God. ... He </span><span class="font5">shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment. ... He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.” ‘Breaking in pieces the oppressor’ will mean an end of wars, graft, bribery, corruption, profiteering, high cost of living, high rents, high taxes, etc. Neither will any person have to pay several times the cost of an article because some man has a copyright or patent </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font5">it. Copyrights and patents will end for ever. It is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font5">and never has been right for any man to patent an idea of which God is the author, and charge excessive prices to his fellow men, when God purposed all his gifts to be free to everybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only will the kingdom deliver the people from </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">selfish interests that now control, but it will bring inconceivable blessings in other ways. God said to Abraham, in Genesis 22:18: “In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.” Centuries later </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Paul </span><span class="font5">explained that the seed of Abraham is The Christ; therefore the blessing of all the families of earth will be by the kingdom of Christ. (Gal. 3:16) Some of these blessings are mentioned in Revelation </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21:4, </span><span class="font5">which reads: “God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall he no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In harmony with the words of Paul, the prophet of God wrote that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">then</span><span class="font5"> “the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick”. (Isa. 33: 24) Again, in Isaiah 35: 5, 6 we read: “Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the cars of the deaf shall be unstopped: then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now let us summarize some of the benefits of this new government. When selfishness, oppression, injustice, profiteering and wars come to an end, that will end degradation and poverty, shot and shell, cannon, poison gas and liquid fire. When disease and death end, that will end suffering, doctors, hospitals, dentists, funerals, cemeteries, drug stores with their 20,000 useless articles, insane asylums, poorhouses, charitable institutions, “red cross,” sanitariums and health resorts. More than all this, the Scriptures assure us that all the dead are coming forth from the tomb and will share in these benefits of God’s ideal government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In John 5:28, 29, we read that Jesus said: ‘ The hour is coming, in the which all that arc in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of man and come forth, they that have done good, . .. and they that have done evil. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the end of the thousand years, when the kingdom has bestowed all its benefits and all the people have received its blessings, conditions in earth will be entirely changed. “The earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.” (Hab. 2:14) Again, Psalm 85:10, “Mercj’ and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.” That will be the time when the entire race will sing the song the angels sang at the birth of Jesus, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus God's ideal government will restore to mankind that which Adam lost for them in the garden of Eden, namely, the favor of God and the right to live on earth forever with all the blessings necessary to contribute to the comfort and happiness of everybody. These blessings will be a perpetual heritage to the entire race, for the reason that all wicked and rebellious evildoers will be cut off in the second death. In Nahum 1:9 we read the assurance given by God, that “affliction shall not rise up the second time'’.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Kingdom greetings! Since the organization of our class, about a year ago, Jehovah has so blessed us that we cannot refrain from joyfully singing his praises. Recognizing the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society as Jehovah’s channel here on earth, we are endeavoring to cooperate in bearing witness to God and his kingdom. As we go through our territory time and time again we find more people who are losing confidence in their church leaders, and we are glad to expose tho Devil and his organization to them. The radio is surely opening the way for witnessing on a greater scale, as evidenced by the many letters of appreciation and by the pleasant reception we receive at many doors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The instruction and help we receive from each </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower </span><span class="font4">and each new book certainly proves that the Lord careth for his own. Proof that you are abiding under the shadow of tho Almighty is clearly shown as you continue to fearlessly engage in the great warfare, and we continually pray that Jehovah will sustain you and all those cohiboring at Bethel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Wishing you the Lord’s richest blessings, and with Christian love, we are</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your brethren in him,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REJOICE TO BE WILLING SERVANTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutiierfoiid :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren of Spokane eeclesia unite in sending their love; also the appreciation of being associated with you as coworkers and assuring you of our continued support of the Society’s program in the service of witnessing the kingdom message to all the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We also rejoice in the unfolding of present truth and in being willing servants in proclaiming the “glad tidings” to others. It is gratifying to leceivo the icport of the publication of millions of books during tiie past year and to know of the zeal and loyalty of colporteur and auxiliary workers, coordinating the work of radio broadcasting, which is bringing the truth concerning God’s name and purposes into millions of homes throughout Christendom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Evidence of the sincere interest of thousands of people in Spokane and surrounding tenitory is manifest in the many responses through letters received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">May the Lord continue to bless and direct you in his service is the prayer of the brethren in the Spokane class.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">We are all praying that you wdl be given grace and strength divine to continue along these same lines in the unfolding of the truth as it becomes “meat in dne season”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We all recognize that the work at Brooklyn is for us; and, under Christ Jesus, our hopes are centered there in divine fellowship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “sop” of truth has become so strong that, as Pastor Russell predicted, “only the most loyal ones will be able </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">abide with it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We take comfort in the belief that “the hail” which we at last have the privilege of sending forth will “sweep away the refuge of lies”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We pray the heavenly Father’s richest blessing upon you in every way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With much Christian love,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">GRATEFUL APPRECIATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Recent articles in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font4"> inspire us to write you our appreciation of these comforting truths, especially the scries on “Jehovah’s Royal House”. Our appreciation is first to Jehovah always, and to you as one of his faithful servants in being used to send them forth to the servant class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bellingham eeclesia, and representatives of surrounding classes who were present, voted unanimously to express our love and gratitude for these blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Surely those who are able to keep in the light of present truth today have cause for rejoicing as they witness 'the confusion of Satan’s host, and especially his ‘high and mighty ones’, as they endeavor to keep the masses in ignorance of tho truth concerning the coming kingdom of Christ and their final liberation from the oppression under Satan’s lordship. We, though few in number, are endeavoring to proclaim these truths to those who mourn and who hunger and thirst for the message here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">IVe assure you of our prayers and support in the work which is progressing and will continue to progress, we believe, until all enemies are put under “his feet”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your brethren by his grace,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">STRENGTHENED IN THE LORD</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Greetings in the kingdom. By unanimous vote of the Waltham eeclesia I am writing you a short letter stating our confidence in you as the Lord's servant, and the pleasure we have in cooperating with you in tho work of the kingdom and in its joys. While wo are still on the earth-side of the veil we feel that enemies must be expected to appear from time to time even as they did at the first advent of our Master, Jesus. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font4">are glad, however, to perceive that you know how to receive their thrusts, and yet wisely, we think, maintain your equanimity. We remember Pastor Russell’s similar experiences, and how he treated them, in the same way that you do. Perceiving them to bo of the adversary and of the adversary's spirit, he gave them no time nor attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Wo are glad that the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Towers</span><span class="font4"> have been free from personal abuse and invective and, instead, have been filled with things of the present truth, which “tend toward Jehovah and righteousness”, as the true prophets’ testimonies alwavs </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font4">could expatiate much on the goodness of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font4"> articles, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy,</span><span class="font4"> and the other books. They have done and are still doing us a great deal of good. We are becoming stronger in the Lord to resist the Devil and his organization agents, and to give all honest inquirers a ‘ ‘ Thus saith the Lord” in replying to their inquiries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But this is written principally to encourage you, to let you know that we recognize that the Lord’s own peculiar support has been given you in all the trying experiences in which you have been since Pastor Russell’s deatli. We can see that you are under peculiar trial for the truth's sake; but we can also</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REJOICING IN THE TRUTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Y'our love and devotion to God is such an inspiration to me. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Towers</span><span class="font4"> are a well of ceaseless outpouring of living waters. Y'our burdens and cares are so heavy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I want to send you a few lines to tell you I have been able to see eye to eye with the light now due on God’s Word; and words fail me to express my appreciation and gratitude to my dear heavenly Father for this wonderful vision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Am so glad that dark Russia, where none of God’s stewards have been allowed to enter, is now getting the message by radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Truly “our King is marching on”. Soon the shouts of victory will rend the skies, and all the earth will be praising God for his wonderful love and life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are asking the channel to know and choose his way; and it is thus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You no doubt know I have been shut in for nearly three years with nervous prostration. Y'et I have had some opportunities to say, Come, to doctors and nurses, and quite a few others in hospitals and sanitariums. Have disposed of some fifty books that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">My suHerings have been very severe; but God’s grace has sustained me every day. “His way is best, and in that precious thought I rest.” I can read, pray, and sing praises unto Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">May God continue to keep you in his love and service, is my prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your sister by his grace, and one hundred percent for tho </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Towers. '</span></p>
