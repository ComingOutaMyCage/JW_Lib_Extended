<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Ecclesiastes 12:12</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE letters with which we are familiar were slowly and painfully formed over the centuries. At first there were sixteen of them, and they served every purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Originally the letter </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font5"> was upside down from the way we have it now, and was quite a fair representation of the ox-head it was designed to picture. Our letter </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span class="font5"> was once like a letter </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">U</span><span class="font5"> turned upside down, and' was intended to represent a house, which it did very w’ell. The letter P, in its original form, was the door to the house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">E</span><span class="font5"> was a lattice or window, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">G</span><span class="font5"> represented the head and neck of a camel, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font5"> was a hand, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">K</span><span class="font5"> the hollow of the hand, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">L</span><span class="font5"> an ox-goad, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">M</span><span class="font5"> was water, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">N</span><span class="font5"> a fish in the water. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span class="font5"> represented a mouth, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Q</span><span class="font5"> the back of the head, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span class="font5"> the head itself, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8</span><span class="font5"> a tooth in the head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span class="font5"> was a cross like a cattle-mark, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V</span><span class="font5"> was a hook or tent-peg, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Z</span><span class="font5"> was a weapon. All the books that have ever been written trace back to these arbitrary marks that were once used to illustrate simple and familiar things. The first writings were without any division into words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ancient books were called skins, because written chiefly upon the skins of animals or birds. The skins when, written upon were formed into rolls and rolled upon sticks. They were usually written on one side only, and divided into columns, called doors, with a space of two fingers’ breadth between the columns. The ink was of lamp black dissolved in gall-juice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English</span><span class="font5"> offers the following definition of a book: “Portable, written or printed treatise, filling a number of sheets fastened together (forming a roll or usually with sheets sewn or pasted hingewise and enclosed in cover): literary composition that would fill such a set of sheets (or several) if printed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In God’s eternal purpose with respect to the human race a Book occupies a most conspicuous place. In that Book we have God’s purposes declared, and the manner of their understanding and application made known. The Bible is the chart of liberty and of hope.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Why Books, Anyway?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">It is not possible for good authors (and they are few) to spread themselves over the country and give a little personal time to each of those homes they would like to visit and where they would be made welcome. In a book is the only way the author can come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the author comes, in his book, he brings with him his own friends, brings his hopes and fears, his ideals and ambitions, his theories and imaginations and convictions. They stalk through the pages with his heroes and heroines and become the personal friends of the readers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the year 1344 Richard de Bury said: “Books are the masters who instruct us without rods and ferrules, without hard words and anger, without clothes or money. If you approach them, they are not asleep: if investigating, you interrogate them, they conceal nothing: if you mistake them, they never grumble: if you are ignorant, they can not laugh at you. The Library, therefore, of wisdom is more precious than all riches, and nothing that can be wished for is worthy to be compared with it. Whosoever therefore acknowledges himself to be a zealous follower of truth’, of happiness, of wisdom, of science, or even of the faith, must of necessity make himself a lover of books.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two centuries ago there were few who could read. Our ancestors used to sneak out to the woods or stable and listen, with a feeling of guilt, while one of the party who knew his letters would slowly spell out from the Bible some vzords which his hearers might or might not understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Subsequently rea’ding aloud by the home fireplace became a treat for all the family. &quot;While one of the home circle read, the others watched the flames dance and the book became a living thing, the dancing fires and the actors in the books becoming merged one with another in the minds of those who heard. The hearth became the center of incentive and of adventure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Books are friends that can be banked on. When days are dark no friends are better. The possession of good books is not extravagance. A man or woman who does not read or will not take the time to read is living on about the same plane as his dog or cat, and not getting much more out of life. Good books are a necessity. They </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">save</span><span class="font5"> money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A lover of books advises never passing a stack of books without glancing at the titles. Even the titles are educative, and in later years one may recall having seen the title of a book that will just suit the need in hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Half of the questions of most persons can be answered by a dictionary and by the World Ahnanac, but that is no reason for living in such a condition of mental confinement. Why live a little and narrow life when you can just as well live a broader and happier one?.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Forbidden Books—and Worse '</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Union Theological Seminary of New York has recently placed on view a thousand volumes that a few hundred years ago would have led to the whole. faculty’s being hanged, burned, banished or thrown into dungeons. Among the dreadful books exhibited was a German Bible, translated from the Hebrew by Martin Luther I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Boston, the conscienceless, still essays the control of the conscience of her citizens. The Watch and Ward Society decides for the people of Boston what they may and what they may not read, and sends word to the booksellers accordingly. After what Boston did to Sacco and Vanzetti it seems peculiarly appropriate that her citizens should have their thinking done for them by a chosen few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the other extreme is a little city of 24,000 people in Ohio. Out of 110 monthly periodicals placed on sale in the city, sixty-eight were out-and-out devoted to sex stuff, and unfit for anybody to read. America now leads France in the production of this kind of mental food. Fifteen or twenty of these magazines are frankly pornographic, carry no advertisements, and are shipped to the dealers by express instead of through the mails. The sad part is that they are multiplying rapidly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are millions of pure men and women who know that a literature which appeals only to baseness of mind, lewdness, is wholly the work of degenerates, and a slander against pure romance and wholesome love. The only way to stop the stream of impurity is to let in a flow of clear water, and that they are doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The task of trying to censor evil literature is too onerous in a land of free speech and free press. Let the Devil go ahead with his books while the Lord and His people go ahead with His books. We shall see who will win, and it is not Open to question. Forty American authors have organized a committee for the suppression of irresponsible censorship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">How the Books Are Divided &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The greatest demand for new books every year is for school use, 84,000,000. The next demand is for works of fiction, 37,000,000. The next are juvenile books, of which 31,000,000 are sold. Then come works on religion and philosophy, with 22,000,000. Poetry, drama and biography account for 9,000,000 more. These figures are for the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Besides the books that are bound in covers we must take into account the fact that twenty of the largest magazines actually published 55,560,000 books a year, mostly devoted to sex.' The United States puts 10,000 new books on the market each year, France 12,000, and Britain 14,000. The total value of the American output is placed at about $900,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The possession of a typewriter or a fountain \ pen does not make a man an author. Many people could never be taught to write readable or profitable literature. We say of some people that they have a “knack” for writing; but writing that is worth while is more than a knack. It is work, and plenty of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those that aspire to fame as writers must be students of words and lovers of words, and must love to express themselves. Robert Louis Stevenson always kept two books in his pocket, one to read and one to write in, and thus was always practicing the writing art. The poet Keats once said of himself, “I should write from the mere yearning and fondness I have for the beautiful, even if my night’s labors should be</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">burnt every morning, and no eye ever rest upon them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some people write because of an inward urge that is almost uncontrollable. A few years ago a Georgia youth who writes poetry, and writes it well, walked all the way to New York to make sure that his work would be read by the magazine to whom he submitted it, and it was read and published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">'Authors Are III Paid</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One reads that David Lloyd George is to get half a million dollars for writing his memoirs, or that the ex-emperor of Germany received half that amount for his effusions, and possibly jumps to the conclusion that it is a profitable kind of work, being an author. Be not deceived. It would be hard to pick an occupation that would be less so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Milton received $75 for writing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise Lost;</span><span class="font5"> Goldsmith received $300 for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Vicar of Wakefield;</span><span class="font5"> Samuel Johnson was paid $500 for writing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rasselas.</span><span class="font5"> The most popular writers, especially those that aim at fame, do more writing for the waste basket than they do for the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If a young author makes a bad guess at a name for his villain and it transpires that there is a mail of that name anywhere, the author can be sued for libel, even though he was unaware that such a person existed. The work requires great concentration. Many writers have kept themselves up on tea, coffee, tobacco and other stimulants until they collapsed. A poet may die of hunger and a good actor may take his poems and recite them in public and make enough in a month to keep him and his family for a year. Writing can not be learned: it must be self-taught.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The young author learns that fiction has the largest sale of any class of literature. He will write fiction and get rich </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font5"> His hopes grow dim when he learns that of every nine hundred manuscripts submitted to publishers only one enjoys a popular success as a book, and only one in thirty ever gets to the bindery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Does the young author’s book attain popularity? Likely as not somebody will accuse him of plagiarism, and even ‘prove’ the claim, and the author may be as innocent as can be. Or the reverse may be true. He submits a manuscript, his ideas are stolen, and he has to fight in the courts to get what are justly his dues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">English authors have just organized a society styled “The Society of Authors Who Have Been Hissed”. A requirement for joining is that some of their works shall have been publicly hissed. A work may sell and yet the author be very unpopular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Many Odd Authors</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Disraeli, Lord Beaconsfield, always wrote in evening dress. This habit is believed to have made his writing elaborate and artificial in style. Dean Farrar used to write his books standing. Maurice Jokai was able to write only if he could use violet ink. James Fenimore Cooper could not write unless he was chewing gum drops. Louisa M. Alcott, famous writer of books for girls, did not like girls. Her book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Little Women</span><span class="font5"> was written at the request of her publishers, and against her own desires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Pulitzer Prize was awarded to a woman W’ho thought she could not write a decent letter. She had made a failure at music, and to assuage the feelings of her teacher she entertained him by telling him the things she had seen and heard on a Carolina plantation. He advised her to write out what she had told him, and out of that suggestion came a world-famous book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An Irish girl, living in an old castle, could not get her works published until finally she wrote a book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Diary of an Eighteenth Century Lady of Fashion,</span><span class="font5"> The young woman who wrote the book knew next to nothing of the subject of which she &quot;was writing, but the book made a hit with the reviewers and with the public and the young woman became famous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thomas Chatterton, one of the lights of English literature, when twelve years old palmed off his own work as the literary relics of a monk long dead. He kept up the deception until he was seventeen, when the fraud was detected and he was reproved by another author. In chagrin he took his own life, while still less than eighteen years of age. Had he lived he would have been one of England’s greatest authors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Shakespeare, the modest bard of Avon, has been said by the British to have been Lord Bacon, Lord Rutland or Lord Stanley. He has been claimed by the Germans, and only recently was claimed by the Italians. The latter have it that he was born at Valtellina, at the foot of the Alps. It thus appears that even if an author becomes famous he may lose his identity in the shuffle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Publisher's End of It</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If nine hundred manuscripts have to be examined in order to light on one really profitable book, the publisher is to be pitied for having to wade through the other eight hundred and ninety-nine, even though he does select one in thirty of them as a possibility. It is no fool of a job to read 900 manuscripts. If you doubt it, try it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Long years of practice have enabled many publishers to know how to protect themselves, in a measure, against the results of their own poor judgment. When they publish a new book they send advance copies to literary celebrities. The celebrity pays the book a compliment. Backed by half a dozen such compliments the publisher forces a market, because humans are sheep and readily follow wherever the leader goes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some publishers make their living by publishing only those books which have already proven their popularity. Over 22,000,000 copies were printed of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">In His Steps</span><span class="font5"> after three Chicago publishers had rejected the manuscript. The book netted its author only $75. When it became popular sixteen publishers took advantage of a defect in the copyright to reprint it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The British Society of Authors, Playwrights and Composers has made up a blacklist of publishers that have been imposing upon authors by asking them to put up $500 to $1,000 toward publishing their books on a cooperative basis. As soon as the author has put up the money the interest of the publisher in the book suddenly terminates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Snags the publisher has to watch are getting out his books all at one time of the year and thus overloading the market; the copyright and international copyright features; the use of bright-colored jackets on the books; illustrations, and the copyrights on them; and a thousand and one other things that the readers of the book never know, anything about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Making of a Book</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The most up-to-date publishing house in the world, located at 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn, N. Y., lists forty-five steps in the making of a book. These steps we summarize briefly as follows: 'Writing the -manuscript, marking the manuscript for composition, linotype composition, first galley proofreading, first galley linotype corrections, second galley proofreading,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">second galley linotype corrections, pasting up. ________</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the dummy, making it up into pages, first page, proofreading, first page corrections, second..........</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">page proofreading, second page corrections, locking up the forms, matrix impressions of page forms, make-up on matrices, making stereotype plates from matrices for rotary press, stereotype plates bored and routed, stereotypes beveled to fit cylinders on press, washing plates, nickel plating, and make ready on rotary press. Thus far we have twenty-two steps, with nothing yet printed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The printing on the rotary press comes next, two 32-page signatures being printed at each cylinder revolution. Next is the folding of the printed signatures or sections, by means of special folder attachments on the rotary presses. Then comes binding the folded signatures into bundles on the bundling machine, storing the . bundled signatures in dry room. End sheets, previously cut to size, are folded and separated. First and last signatures are run through the endsheeting machine for application of endsheets. 32-page signatures or sections are gathered by machine into complete books. Pressed on smasher, using one hundred tons pressure. Sewed on sewing machine. Cut apart into single books. Books trimmed. After thirty-three steps ■we are now ready for the bindery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">First coat of glue is applied by machine on backbone of books. Rounded and backed in machine known as rounder and backer. Fed into ' back-lining machine, which successively puts on the back a coat of glue, the gauze hinger, another coat of glue, and finally the back-lining.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the making of the covers, book cloth is first cut to required width on a special machine. Another cuts the chip or cardboard to proper size. The cut cloth and cardboard are fed into a ma- ' chine known as the casemaker, which glues the cloth on to the cardboard and attaches the backlining strip. Covers are then fed into gold leaf stamping machine, -where heated brass die stamps gold leaf upon them. The case-former machine rounds the backbone of the cover. Forty-one steps before a cover is on a book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now the books are fed into a casing-in machine, which mechanically pastes the cases or covers upon the books. From the casing-in machine the freshly covered books are put between brass-bound boards in the standing presses for drying. After six to ten hours in the standing presses the books are taken out and inspected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Books are now packed in cartons and are ready for shipment. They still have to be sold!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Oddities in Books</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Does the mind run to many words? There is the Ganyur, which is the religion of Tibet, cramped down into a single book of 200 volumes. When it was carried across country to Peking it took 100 coolies to carry what was absolutely the biggest load of nonsense that was ever piled on human backs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Perhaps the mind runs to books with large leaves. If so, there is the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Book of French Industry,</span><span class="font5"> which contains three hundred pages each fourteen feet by seven feet. There is also an atlas in the British Museum which is taller than the average man. It was once the property of King Charles II.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Does the mind run to books with small leaves ? </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Court of Flowers,</span><span class="font5"> published in Holland in 1674, is one-fourth the size of a postage stamp. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The London Almanack,</span><span class="font5"> published in 1838, measures three-quarters of an inch by five-eighths, and is about one-eighth of an inch thick. It contains several portraits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Perhaps the mind runs to beautiful pages. If so, there is the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Book of Kells,</span><span class="font5"> made by an Irish monk, at Kells, Ireland, an embellished copy of the Gospels. Designers who have seen the book marvel at the thousand and one intricacies of design, and the keenness of vision which enabled lines of microscopical fineness to be made so sharp and clear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When it comes to bindings, it is said that one of the most beautifully bound books is in Paris, where, delicately traced on the front cover, is a butterfly with its wings extended ready for flight, made of the skin of the anonymous author of the book. The Philadelphia hospital medical library contains six volumes bound in human skin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Books have been made of virgin parchment, soft as velvet, made from the skin of stillborn kids; they have been embellished by hand decorations of the finest artists of the day; and they have been enclosed in covers of ivory inlaid with precious jewels, or within tablets of beaten gold. Oddly enough, the summit of bookbinding excellence was attained in Russia, where the expense of doing anything, if it was for the royal family, was  never even considered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Best Sellers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is claimed that there have been distributed of the Bible some 675,000.000 copies, or enough, if they were preserved, to provide two copies for every family now living on the earth. Of Bunyan’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Pilgrim’s Progress</span><span class="font5"> it is estimated that 150,000,000 copies have been sold, and of the Analectics of Confucius about 100,000,000, strung out over 2,300 years. Some 50,000,000 copies of Judge Rutherford’s books have been sold in the last ten years. Of Dickens’ books 30,000,000 have been sold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Six American authors, Mark Twain, Irving, Hawthorne, Emerson, Thoreau and Whitman, have a yearly average sale of 25,000 copies each, and in the retail book trade are considered the best American sellers. When a writer is in the high tide of his popularity his books may sell by the millions, but when the wave of popularity passes his books are soon forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">America has some literary clubs that take it upon themselves to tell the American people what books are worth reading and what are not. In effect this has worked out as a dictatorship, resulting in millions reading only what they are told to read, thus making all their minds monotonously alike. The Book of the Month Club is peculiarly an American institution, having as its apparent objective the making of all Americans into intellectual automatons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No man is clever enough to pick out in advance the books which will finally be proven to be permanent favorites. Indeed, it is<sup>j</sup> claimed that the total number of books in the English language which the best obtainable judges would declare worthy of the first rank is only about 600, and that if 50 more books were added to the list, for translations, it would not be necessary to go much further to see all that man has done in the writing line that is worth while.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Books at Second Hand</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font5"> dealer in second-hand books must himself be a book-lover, and second-hand books are their own salesmen. In the largest and best second-hand book stores there are stalls or nooks where the interested may read for hours without being disturbed. A man who stops to look at a second-hand book will usually buy it. Many college textbooks are resold, often many times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font5"> London dealer in second-hand books has hit upon the novel plan of buying and selling them by weight ; surely an odd method. This presupposes that the best books are the largest and heaviest; surely a wide departure from the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A Tarrytown (N. Y.) man recently bought a second-hand dictionary for his children. Arrived home he found that some of the leaves were glued together. He placed the dictionary on a radiator, with the result that the glued leaves fell apart and eight dollars in gold coin dropped to the floor. One of the coins was of rare coinage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">High Prices for Books</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rare books are like rare pictures. Special associations give the books a value far above anything they might have for the purpose for which they were originally designed. Edgar Allen Poe’s own copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Raven</span><span class="font5"> sold for $7,600 merely because he had once owned it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some years ago Rudyard Kipling wrote a book entitled </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Smith Administration.</span><span class="font5"> For some reason it was decided to withdraw the book, and only six copies escaped the flames. One of these was recently sold for $14,000, a record price in view of the fact that Mr. Kipling still lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some authors pay no attention to the original manuscripts of their books, consigning them to the flames as soon as published; yet five pages of the original manuscript of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Pickwick Papers</span><span class="font5"> were recently sold for $37,500.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the first folios of Shakespeare’s plays was recently sold in London for $62,000. Shelley’s own copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Queen Mob,</span><span class="font5"> with numerous manuscript notes by the author, sold for $68,000, and the original manuscript of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Alice in Wonderland</span><span class="font5"> was recently sold by Alice herself, namely Mrs. Alice P. Hargreaves, for $75,259.80. This book was written by a stammering young Oxford instructor in mathematics who, when Alice and two friends were little girls, entertained them on a boat ride on the Thames by telling them this story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Grimm’s Fairy Tales,</span><span class="font5"> including “Ilans and Gretel”, “Tom Thumb,” “The Frog Prince,” “Rumpelstiltskin,” etc., were folk tales of German peasants carefully collected by two brothers, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, who subsequently became professors at the University of Berlin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ordinary Prices for Books</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The World War boosted the price of books sky high. Even in the fall of 1929 one of the largest department stores in New York advertised its gift books at $2.50 to $5.00, none less than $2.50. These prices are beyond the means of the common people, and purchasers are necessarily limited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Judge Rutherford’s friends have made a vast improvement here. His books, on the most vital subjects that can affect the destiny of man, are sold at 35c to 45c each, and reach thousands where they would reach only individuals if sold at the higher prices charged elsewhere for works no better gotten up. Many authors would be glad if their books, too, could get into the hands of the people at a cost to the latter of only forty-odd cents, but they do not know how to get it done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Care of Books</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Books need to be dusted once a day v/ith a light wool or feather duster, and at least once a month should be carefully wiped separately. Leatherbound books should be given a coating of neatsfoot oil once a year. No book should be left in the direct rays of the sun. It will dry out the glue, loosen the binding, and discolor the cloth. A book should either stand vertical or lie flat. It should never be allowed to stand on edge on one cover, in a twisted position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The way to open a new book is to take a few pages at a time and gently press them back. A book that is grabbed and cracked open violently may be permanently injured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Finger marks may be removed from books as follows: Pour benzol (not benzine, but benzol) on calcined magnesia, and apply it lightly with the tip of the finger. When the benzol has evaporated the magnesia may be brushed off and any dirt that yet remains can be removed by using a piece of soft, rubber.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Russia Will Latinise Alphabet</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THE Russian alphabet of thirty-six letters will be Latinized, and the work has been already begun. It seems inevitable, with the start that has now been made, that the Latin characters will become universal, because first one country and then another is giving up its antique alphabet for the one now most generally used.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The witness answered that he did not think there was an undertaker who did not do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font5"> SHORT time ago the Communists lawfully assembled in Queen’s Park, Toronto, to give expression to their beliefs, but General Draper, the chief of police, autocratically determined that such a meeting should not be held and gave instructions to his force to unlawfully break up the meeting, resulting in much discussion by the press throughout Canada. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Star-Phoenix, </span><span class="font5">of Saskatoon, editorially comments as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The city of Toronto, in which a man was convicted for blasphemy last year, is now making itself comic by the use of its police power to suppress communists. There have been one or two clashes in Queen’s Park between policemen and “red” gatherings, not to mention innocent bystanders who were on the spot to watch the fun. It seems that the Toronto force is under orders to prevent, by physical violence if need be, the holding of open-air meetings for the advancement of communist opinion. On Tuesday last a gathering was broken up, the police using fists and batons freely, before a word had been spoken by the orator of the occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Toronto does not appear to understand that freedom of speech does not mean freedom to say what is orthodox, inoffensive and acceptable to the majority. It means freedom to express heterodox, offensive and unpopular opinions. Otherwise it is a mockery. The  theory of democracy is that the people are sufficiently intelligent to distinguish between the false and the true in political doctrines. An extension of this basic rule is that every citizen is entitled to a hearing of his views, however lunatic and impractical they may appear to others. Toronto proceeds on the opposite supposition. It acts on the theory that if the communists are permitted to talk freely they will endanger peace, order and good government. In other words, Toronto does not credit its citizens with sufficient brains to perceive the fallacy and unwisdom of communist preaching and policy. It thinks they need protection against the persuasive powers of Jack McDonald and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In acting on this belief, Toronto ignores the teaching of history and deviates sharply from British procedure which is said to enjoy great respect in the minds of Toronto citizens. The encounters between the police and the reds in Queen’s Park will provide the communist cause in Toronto with martyrs, a very useful asset for any minority party; frighten into silence others who hold unusual views, and so tend to impose a smug and drab uniformity of opinion; and finally persuade many people that there must be something in communism after all to explain the frantic fear its advocates arouse in the respectable majority. It is primarily Toronto’s business what the Toronto police does in restricting freedom of speech. In another sense it concerns all of Canada; for Toronto is the second city of the Dominion, and its example, for good or ill, is influential.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Hush,</span><span class="font5"> commenting on the same affair, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In London, England, on “Red Day”, after two months of preparation, the Communists demonstrated on Trafalgar Square. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Nobody objected: Nobody opposed them. Scotland Yard ordered the police to vacate the square and give them free rein. Less than 200 gathered, spceched for twenty minutes or so, and left disgustingly disappointed because they had not been opposed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Toronto a handful of misguided mentally twisted irresponsible youths are denied the right of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">free </span><span class="font3">speech. They make a fuss about it and attempt to make Communist martyrs out of themselves by defying the police and authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Last week in Queen’s Park the Toronto police force staged the most brutal attack upon an unarmed, harmless handful of malcontents and two or three hundred innocent Park visitors and curious onlookers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mounted policemen chased women and little children pell-mell through flower beds. Burly cops slapped, beat, kicked and punched anyone and everyone who came in their way. It was a disgraceful, cowardly business. These Communists are not all bad. It is just as useless to oppose by force the evolution of thought as it is to frustrate the evolution of machinery and invention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The same type of men who staged and glorified in this outrage, are the kind of men who fathered the Inquisition, the tyranny of the Scotch Covenanters and the riots against the spinning jenny!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is said that if any policeman were bisected a police badge would be found tattooed on his heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One good-sized tear bomb was all that was necessary in Queen’s Park, if force was required.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Making a Monkey of Coercion &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">At a more recent date the communists made the mayor of Toronto, the police force and the chief in particular, a laughing stock by advertising a further meeting and then not having their speakers put in an appearance. The Toronto </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font5"> in no uncertain terms criticizes, editorially, the action of the authorities. It states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The  police threw a cordon around the park last night and drew a ring of mounted men around the bandstand. Thousands of sight-seers lined the neighboring streets, but the Communists did not show up. Or if they did they arrived singly and inconspicuously and joined the spectators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The mayor was there, ready if necessary to read the Riot Act. But there was no occasion for it. There was nobody to read it to. Never, perhaps, did a mayor carry the Riot Act to a scene so peaceful. The occasion was one of police manreuvres. The preparation for battle was complete, the strategy elaborate, but the enemy was nowhere to be seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Communists would have needed to have been very many times as numerous and strong as they arc to have challenged the formidable preparations of the police.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The trouble with this method of dealing with this small group of trouble makers is that the elaborate power display of last night is a large one to make every day, or whenever Tim Buck or Abie Pearl decides he would like to review police manoeuvres in the park and see the Mayor with the Biot Act under his arm. The present method is to turn out the police in battle formation at such time and place as these disturbers </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">say</span><span class="font3"> they will hold a meeting, whether they mean to hold it or not. The method is absurd. The bringing out of so much heavy cannon to shoot at mosquitoes is far below the level of being sensible. Something less than cavalry and artillery is needed in a case of this kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">■ It is not the result of chance, nor is it the mere indulgence of a theory that the British practice of allowing free speech, even on the part of those who revile the authorities, is what it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is the result of a long experience. After trying every way the right way was found. It is not only the right way for the reason that free speech, is considered to be the privilege of free men in a free country, but it was found, after much experience, that it is the right way for the reason that it works. It is the most practical and effective way and the one that gives the authorities and the police the least trouble, worry and expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There were times when the British authorities used to try suppressing meetings, riding horsemen through mobs and in other ways applying violent action as punishment for violent speech. But it never worked. The tongue is at best an unruly member and the mouths of the multitude are not easily stopped from speaking. It was learned in Britain that the effort to suppress speeches of protest multiplied what was being said in protest, and that of all meetings the public meeting was more innocent of mischief and less significant of malice than any other kind of meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The British plan of letting discontented persons relieve their grievances in speech was adopted only after attempts at forceful suppression had failed, as it still fails in many other countries. The British plan has worked. The other day an English newspaper remarked that &quot;in Paris the one-day strike does something to atone for the French failure to invent Bank Holiday”. There is a composure in the English attitude toward the oratory of discontent and this composure arises from the assured confidence that men who are free to say what they think can never deceive themselves or others into believing that they are truly oppressed. But silence them by force and their supposed wrongs fester and complications set in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is not for nothing nor the result of chance that British policy in this matter is what it is. Centuries of experience have resulted in the present plan being adopted as the best for all concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Prices of Flour and Bread</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Owing to the very severe drought which has been nation-wide, the field crops of Western Canada will be less than 50 percent of last years. This shortage has already been taken advantage of by the bakers’ combine to boost the price of bread. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ihi.sk,</span><span class="font5"> commenting upon this increase, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Master Bakers Association of Toronto, which is real!;/ the Bread Trust, have gone wild in their desire to garner pennies from the poor man’s table.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The price of bread has been raised to 12 cents for a pound-and-a-half loaf. Yet flour is only $8.70 per barrel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The kindly daily press stated the other day that until flour prices fell at least $1.50 per barrel there could be no reduction in the price of bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Flour in Vancouver, B. C., is $8.90 a barrel. The Master Bakers Association of that city recently increased the price of a pound-and-a-half loaf from 8V to 9 cents (not from 10 to 12 cents, as in Toronto).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is passing- strange that a few thousand miles should make such a price difference. Maybe the cost of water and salt in Toronto accounts for it, or maybe the $13.62 per share paid by the Canada Bread Company on its common watered stock has something to do with it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Funeral of Dr. R. F. Johnson</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">W</span><span class="font5">E HAVE in hand a four-column report of the funeral of Dr. R. F. Johnson, of Georgetown, British Guiana. There are several interesting features about it. Dr. Johnson was perhaps the most prominent physician in the Guianas. The child of parents of wealth, he was a graduate of Edinburgh and Cambridge universities, but lived for the poor and for the Lord. After his death it was found that he was carrying twenty-five children through school. He was a Bible Student, an “I.B.S.A.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Doctor Johnson’s funeral there were 150 motor cars in procession, and a like number of floral pieces. Business in Georgetown was practically suspended for the day. The flag at the town hall was flown at half mast and the meeting of the town council was postponed. Dr. Johnson was a native Guianese, a black man.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">W</span><span class="font5">E HAVE before us a financial statement of the First Methodist Church of Corpus Christi, Texas, and it makes interesting reading. We have no criticism to make of the pastor’s salary of $3,750 a year, nor of any of the other 33 items which go to make up the total annual expense of running the business, amounting all told to $12,012.40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The chairman of the board of stewards starts out with the statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Board of Stewards wish to report to the membership the financial condition of the First Methodist Church for the three quarters of the Conference year, showing an itemized account of what the members have paid and how the same has been paid out. We feel that this private report should be put in the hands of every member of the church. You are entitled to know the facts of the on-going of your great Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The pastor backs up the preliminaries with the statement that “We have had 240 accessions to the membership of the church since Annual Conference. No church in the West Texas Conference is growing faster than old First Church.” Then comes a list of the 757 members, which makes it look as if most of them had been gathered in during the past three years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The thing that we found interesting in the report was, not the contribution of Mr. and Mrs. W. W. Jones, who had come across with $675.50 of the $900 they have promised to pay, nor yet that of Mr. and Mrs. O. B. Carver, who had agreed to pay $400 and had actually paid $500. Nor did we find anything specially noteworthy in any of the twelve remaining contributions which ranged from $100 to $225. Verily, these have all had their reward, gratified vanity. Probably they are all in business or stockholders in some public service corporations and therefore well able to spare $100 or so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We would not think of saying anything about the : middle class families, 379 : members of which managed to squeeze out something between $1 and $82 apiece and thus got among the Dollar Christians, but Ave do feel sorry for the 309 members who had to • have the humiliation of having their names listed without a single cent being set down opposite their names. Oddly enough that is nearly one-half the listed membership of the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a still more unhappy situation socially are the poor things that tried to do something, what little they could spare, and fell short of the dollar mark. There were fifty-two of these poor things. One of them got up to ninety-five cents. Another nickel and he would have been safe among the Dollar saints. The next man below him was seven cents shy of being what you might call a true Dollar Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Three of them stuck fast at 90c, three chipped in 85c each, two 80c, and one 75c. One parted with 70c, three with 65c, and one missed the 65c class of saints by just a copper. Two of them were stood up for 60c and four of them came under the wire with an even half-dollar to their credit on the books of St. Peter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Four got up to the chin at 45c, two were paddling around with gasbags under their arms at 40c, and four made ringers at 35c. There was only one thirty-center. The others were wise</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">How Chain Stores</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Increase Taxes</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ent— &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A S THE chain stores</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">increase in number there is a direct increase in the taxation . which the public they serve must bear, because the four merchants displaced by each one of these stores are no longer taxable as such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The facts show that the average merchant pays about four times as much in taxes as the average householder. When he ceases to be a merchant and himself becomes an ordinary householder his taxes fall in proportion. And what he fails to pay, the rest of the community must make up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Chain stores operate, for the most part, in rented buildings. The only taxes .they pay are on their stocks of merchandise. The four store ....... buildings which they have closed deteriorate in value and cease to be high taxable entities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. . They are now to be found in every town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every dollar spent in a chain store helps to rivet a little larger tax burden on every citizen in the community. Have you noticed that your taxes are growing? This is.one of the reasons. When you buy from an independent merchant some of your money stays in town. When you buy from a chain store practically all of it goes out of town. . . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another important factor is that every chain store means a considerable decrease of employment in the community. The four independent stores that were displaced were each carrying several persons. These persons must now go elsewhere to gain a livelihood. Before they go they are taxpayers; after they go they are not, and the community as a whole must make it up.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>44</sup>Aluminum Propaganda” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. Charles T. Betts</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE purpose of this paper is to give the facts pertaining to the attempts made by the aluminum or other organizations to prevent information reaching the public upon aluminum poisoning. Almost every public lecturer or publisher who has lectured or printed upon this subject receives a letter or is visited soon after by a representative of the aluminum interests. It is usually intimated that the remarks reported as having bt n stated were undoubtedly misquoted, but they vant to know if the statements accredited to the speaker were made by him. If he has been guilty as quoted, an explanation is in order. Tactics of this sort usually intimidate these persons and nothing more is heard from them. [On November 13, 1929, the editor was favored with a similar visit by an official representative of the United States Government.—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The managing editor of the Toledo </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font5">had the courage of his convictions and published one of the writer’s articles. The next morning he was dismissed from the editorship of this eighty-six-page paper, and the writer has been informed that he was told frankly that his dismissal was due to his 0. K. to the publishing of the article. Such an act strikes right at the basic principles or foundation upon ■which our republic is founded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. M. Schafberger became so interested in the subject of aluminum poisoning that he decided to sell and distribute the writer’s books and other literature in New York city. It was not long before he had an “accident”. He was pushed off a subway platform. In falling, his head struck the rail, with the result that his skull was crushed. The writer called upon him while he was confined to his bed to secure any possible information, and found that he did not want his wife or daughter to suspect how he had met his fate. lie wanted the daughter to carry on the work, for the good of mankind, which he had started. The wound on top of his head did not heal and it was not long before his brain was affected, his death following. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An editor owning a chain of papers in the Middle West saw fit to publish articles furnished by the writer. He soon found that it was impossible to continue his papers, and, needless to say, sold out to a “power trust”. Now articles of this character do not appear under the new “ownership”. It is difficult to determine just who is financially concerned in such purchases, but the “leak” was stopped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The aluminum trust did not make any statements of my knowledge directly to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font5"> of New York, after they published articles by Dr. William Held and the writer. It is evident, however, that tremendous pressure was applied somewhere, because Dr. Harvey Wiley of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Good Housekeeping</span><span class="font5"> magazine wrote a letter to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font5"> demanding to know why they published such articles as furnished by Drs. Held and Betts. Dr. Wiley’s letter is one so different in character from anything else the writer has ever seen written by him that he suspects it was dictated by someone other than the doctor. At any rate, it was very unethical or discourteous for an associate editor of one magazine that carries aluminumware advertising to attempt to dictate the policy of another with which he has no connection, especially so since the latter paper does not accept aluminum-ware advertising. In this instance Dr. Wiley got exactly what was coming to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. Charles B. McFerrin, of Orlando, Florida, frequently made reference to aluminum poisoning from kitchen utensils, in his lectures. An attempt to stop this was made by the Aluminum Association. The doctor considered the correspondence between the Association and himself of sufficient importance to the American public that he published two pages of it in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The McFerrin Bulletin.</span><span class="font5"> This is another exposition of the activities of the aluminum trust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A prominent medical journal published several articles upon the subject of aluminum poisoning; the writer is informed that threats and intimidation were at once made by a great medical union which furnishes considerable space to advertisers of aluminumware. The editor of the smaller journal was given to understand what would be the best policy for his future attitude upon this subject or he would have to accept the consequences if their suggestion was ignored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The editor of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Naked Truth</span><span class="font5"> magazine of Muscatine, Iowa, decided to publish matters pertaining to aluminum poisoning. He announced in May issue, 1929, that a series of articles from the writer’s pen would appear in their paper, beginning the following, month. Within several days after the announcement was made an official representative of the alu-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">minimi trust called at their office for the purpose of preventing the series’ being published. Whatever his proposition consisted of was not considered by the editor, for the articles were published as contemplated. This is another case of an attempt by the aluminum, trust to prevent the public from getting the facts which should be available to all for their health protection through the medium of the public press. A full account of the experience of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">TNT</span><span class="font5"> with “The Power Behind the Throne” was published in their December, 1929, issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Control of the press is not limited to our country by the powers that be. Evidence tends to prove that the financial interests dominate and control papers in other countries. In Winnipeg, Canada, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Free Press</span><span class="font5"> (note the name) issued a contract with one of the citizens of that city for advertising purposes; in this case the owner of a restaurant advertised that he did not cook food for public consumption in aluminum-ware. This ad. was observed by the J. H. Ashdown Hardware Co., Ltd., to contain the statement in reference to aluminum. Objection was at once made to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Free Press</span><span class="font5"> to this item appearing in the ad. The editor of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Free Press </span><span class="font5">deliberately changed the wording of the ad. which they had made contract to publish, to suit the purveyors of aluminum kitchen utensils. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Does the reader think for a moment that one hardware store complaint could cause an editor to break his contract with an advertiser? No! “The Power Behind the Throne” was on the job there in ’Winnipeg to intimidate the editor’ of a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Free Press</span><span class="font5"> just the same as it is operating in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The writer has had a little experience also with the powers that be. He was visited by a gentleman the following morning after the article appeared in the Toledo </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font5"> above referred to, and was advised to disclaim and retract all the statements made therein and forward same to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> office at once, in order to prevent any legal action which might be taken by the aluminum interests. The writer never made any retraction. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> evidently bowed the knee to the interests’ demands, for the managing editor was dismissed and they published all the supplied articles that were presented to them on the following Sunday in making retraction of the statements made on December 13, 1925.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When it was found that the aluminum-interests were financially connected with the great Medical Union, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">An Opinion Upon Aluminum </span><span class="font5">was published. This booklet made its appearance on the 23d of September, 1926. An extensive article defending aluminumware and condemning the writer was written by Dr. Morris Fishbein, editor, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">American Medical Association Journal,</span><span class="font5"> and published in that paper, October 23, 1926. This was a complete exposure of how the interests work, apparently using those who accept their money for advertising space to crush any attempt to give health </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">inf</span><span class="font5">ormation to the public that would injure their business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was discovered that our government had made a secret, investigation of the physiological effect of aluminum compounds, that in more than five years’ time 158 witnesses were examined and four thousand closely typewritten pages of testimony were taken, after which the examiner, Edward M. Averill, made his official report to the Trade Commission. This report was published in New York and distributed to scientists and physicians. The writer found a copy of it in his physician’s office. He thought this report would be good information for the laity as well as professionals, so decided to republish all or a part of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who were examined in Washington in this case were the highest known medical scientists who are .members of The American Medical Union. The statements these persons gave under oath concerning poisoning by aluminum compounds to our federal examiner were in great contrast to what their official spokesman, Fishbein, had just written about the writer and his brochure. There is no evidence to show that the doctor was not also as familiar with the subject of aluminum poisoning as were the rest of his subjects at the time the above-mentioned editorial was written.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Someone discovered that part of Averill’s report was to be published for general public benefit. The writer received a telegram from Otis B. Johnson, secretary of the Federal Trade Commission, which stated that it would be “highly improper” to publish any or all of Averill’s Official Report, Docket 540, on account - of its being a “confidential document”. One of two courses was now to be pursued: either publish the document, giving due and proper credit, and defy the order or publish parts of the document without due and proper credit. The latter course was chosen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Before the book could be published under these circumstances a little time was required to remove from the manuscript proper credit upon parts of the document which were to be published. The only conclusion the writer could assume from the government order was that the Federal Trade Commission did not want to be the &quot;cats paw” in the aluminum discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is interesting to note what occurred at this particular time. A letter was written to the Federal Trade Commission to determine for a certainty that the telegram actually came from it in reference to the demand for silence upon the aluminum question:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">June 16, 1928 Honorable Otis B. Johnson, Secretary Federal Trade Commission</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Washington, D. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">My dear Mb. Johnson : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I received a telegram from your office today, that causes me to understand that the Federal Trade Commission is a secret Federal organization and that the testimonies given before the Trial Examiner, as well as the official reports or documents, are confidential instruments to the Federal Body, after the cases have been dismissed. Is this the intention of the telegram?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I have been to considerable expense in time and money in preparing the new book “Aluminum Poisoning” for distribution and will appreciate your advising me, under seal of the Federal Trade Commission, by letter, so that I will know that it (demand for silence) comes from our Federal officers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thanking you in advance, for this courtesy, I am Very respectfully,</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Ten days after this letter was forwarded to the Commission the folio-wing answer was received :</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">June 26, 1928 </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Sir: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your letter of June 16th was received and presented to the Commission, and in reply I was directed to quote my telegram to you under date of June 15th, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Attention Federal Trade Commission called to circular announcing contents book proposed to be published by you entitled ‘Aluminum Poisoning’ and containing quotations from report of Trial Examiner Averill of staff this Commission Stop Be advised Commission regards report Trial Examiner Averill as confidential document and its publication in whole or in part as highly improper stop Commission would appreciate advice your intention this respect.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">With reference to your statement relative to testimony and report of the trial examiner, I was directed to say that the testimony of witnesses in formal docket cases and all the evidence introduced in these cases, is a public record, but that it is only the trial examiner’s report which is a confidential document.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As suggested in your letter of June 16th, I have affixed the seal of the Federal Trade Commission to this letter, and this seal, according to the statute, shall be judicially noticed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">320 Superior St.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Toledo, Ohio &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the period of time elapsing between the time of receiving this letter from the Federal Trade Commission and that of the manuscript’s being changed to eliminate proper credit to Averill, letters began to arrive from the various scientists or persons quoted in Averill’s report, some of the letters coming from as distant parts of the world as London and Paris. Practically all of these letters began with the same caption, “It has come to my notice” or “I have been directed to inform you not to quote me in your proposed book called </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Aluminum Poisoning”.</span><span class="font5"> It is evident that someone with invisible power had succeeded in using it to have the various persons make these demands upon the writer. This shows how “The Power Behind the Throne” works in connection vrith college professors or others who “jump” at their commands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has never been ascertained who was responsible for the Commission’s act in demanding silence upon the publishing of Averill’s report. The law (Clayton Act) allows the “lightning workers” to remain “under cover”. It is apparent, however, that the interests were at work, and the writer assumes that the aluminum trust caused this action to be taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now let us investigate the publishing side of health matters. We have a large number of scientific health and housekeeping journals which should be the first to investigate claims made by anyone who thinks he has something for the betterment of national health. Health conditions are in such a deplorable state that this is no time to sit back and laugh or ridicule! Prominent young business men are dropping dead in their office or on the street, everywhere, like flies around a plate of poison. Many look to these journals to give them health information; yet some of the editors of the magazines deliberately assume and charge by innuendo that the writer is financially interested in manufacturing kitchenware and that a trade war is on. This has been repeatedly done without making any investigation of the writer’s claims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A few articles appearing recently in prominent national and international magazines protecting and defending aluminum kitchenware are noted here: Milo Hastings, in the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Graphic,</span><span class="font5"> December 27, 1927; also in McFadden’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Physical Culture,</span><span class="font5"> June, 1928; Dr. Rasmus Alsacker published about nine pages in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Correct Eating,</span><span class="font5"> January, 1928; Dr. Morris Fishbein, in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">American Medical Association Journal,</span><span class="font5"> October 23, 1926; A. A. Hopkins, Ph. D., in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Scientific American,</span><span class="font5"> July, 1928, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Literary Digest,</span><span class="font5"> New York, April 13, 1929; and Dr. Harvey Wiley’s article in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Good Housekeeping, </span><span class="font5">repeated September, 1929.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All these magazines or medical organizations sell advertising space extensively to the manufacturers or purveyors of aluminum kitchenware. It is evident that tremendous pressure was brought to bear in order to protect the financial interests of their (aluminum) advertisers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When all of these means failed to stop the truth upon aluminum poisoning from reaching the public, the interests implored the Federal authorities to take action. A complaint was filed and informal charges were placed with the government of conspiracy and violation of the Clayton Act. “The mills of the gods grind slowly.” Government action is usually the same along this line. However, the demand for silence upon the aluminum question was forwarded by telegraph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Directly after </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Aluminum Poisoning</span><span class="font5"> was off the press and the first copies distributed, the charges were filed with the Government, and official action was taken immediately or within several hours. A Federal examiner, Mr. James Horton, was at once dispatched to Toledo. When, he arrived at the writer’s office he advised of the charges, before the government, against him. The examiner was vested with authority to give me a hearing and made demand to “see, investigate and examine” everything in my office pertaining to the aluminum crusade, especially the data pertaining to the publishing of the books, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">An Opinion Upon Aluminum,</span><span class="font5"> the 50c brochure, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Aluminum Poisoning, a</span><span class="font5"> $2.50 book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Federal examination of the writer’s office effects and aluminum crusade material was made over a year ago, in the week of October 10, 1928, and no formal charges have been preferred. Apparently, the charges on file were dismissed after the examiner’s report. The wonder grows, just what means the interests will employ next, since all these efforts utterly failed to intimidate the writer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. Joseph Keating, editor of the Toledo </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Leader,</span><span class="font5"> published his fearless opinion of our “dollar patriots”. It had come to his attention how the aluminum interests had acted in the matter of poisoning by aluminum cooking utensils, which was published in the Toledo </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Dr. Betts Continues Fight for Truth in Case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This is another of those true stories which prove beyond the power of contradiction that the American plunderbund completely controls the daily press, that they use their advertising power to intimidate publishers and editors and to suppress facts and important truths the people should be told of for their protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It shows also that the pirates will stop at nothing in getting rid of anyone that interferes with their dollar grabbing. It proves, too, that to the dollar patriots nothing is sacred—not even human life. It shows they will sacrifice the health and comfort of an entire nation if by doing so they make money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Money is their god, their flag, their constitution, their country, and their all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It may be possible that a large number of our so-called prominent health writers belong to the “Dollar Patriots” class. The facts about aluminum poisoning are bound to become available to all the public in the near future and some health writers may have occasion to hang their heads in shame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the power of the aluminum or other in-</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A Word About the Ehret System </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By</span><span class="font5"> IE. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">E. Brokaw (Arizona) '</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">TN HIS communication on &quot;Hints on Health”, in your issue of September 4, Dr. S. B. Hilf seems to me to have misunderstood Prof. Arnold Ehret. The doctor says: “Mucus is not the only and not the main cause of disease.” As I understand Ehret, mucus is his name for the poisons in the system. On page 85 of his book he said: “There is but one disease—inside dirt, waste and obstructions.” That makes mucus the disease, not the cause of disease. He spoke of mucus-forming and non-mucus-forming foods, or “a mucusless diet’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I understand that not only Ehret, but other Nature Cure practitioners, hold that poisons are deposited by the blood in the body cells, thus producing the chronic conditions, and that it is new poisons continually put into the blood stream that keep it loaded. I understand that Ehret taught that his diet-healing system gradually released the poisons from the body cells, putting them back into the blood, and then eliminating them. In spite of what Doctor Hilf says about impurities’ getting hardened at weak spots, etc., it seems that Ehret did succeed in restoring many such patients to health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘What the doctor says about the herb remedies recalls to me that place on page 85 of Ehret’s book: “The average health seeker thinks that there is some special food or special mixture to be eaten for his particular ailment, and he ° tries everything—but always in vain, as long as he doesn’t know and doesn’t understand that there is but one disease—inside dirt, waste and obstructions, and that these obstructions must and can be eliminated only—and systematically only—by the opposite of disease-producing, mucus-forming foods, that is, by The Mucusless-Diet Healing System’, a mucusless diet, consisting of fruits and herbs, meaning green-leaf vegetables.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nature Cure practitioners generally consider all diseases as one disease, not requiring special remedies for each symptom but a cleansing of the whole system. I understand that an alka-lin-forming diet will do this cleansing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Doctor Hilf says Ehret “publishes in his book a table of wholesome foods. Among the first-class foodstuffs he mentions . .■ . Among the less valuable he puts down ..etc. But Ehret said: “These tables by Ragnar Berg were published in Germany ten years after my ‘mucus theory’ of disease and food qualities had been _ taught. . . . The mere fact that some foods . given in the list are ‘acid-binding’ does not necessarily mean that I endorse their use. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">This list is given as a comparison only and should be studied for what it is worth.</span><span class="font5"> Please understand that I am not endorsing Berg’s theories.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The utility of Ehret’s system does not depend upon his assumption (which I consider erroneous) that ‘the white skin of the white race is . proof of a mucus condition’. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- ........</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As to fasting: In spite of Ehret’s saying,. —■■■ “Every cure, and especially every cure of diet, should start with a two or three-day fast,” he also said: “The Mucusless-Diet Healing System is a combination of individually advised long or--------~ -</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">short fasts, with progressive changing menus of non-mucus-forming foods. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">This Diet alone can heal every case of ‘disease’</span><span class="font5"> without fasting, although such a cure requires longer time.” .....</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Again he said: “You may be surprised when I tell you that I had to cure patients from the ill ......</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">effects of too long a fast.” Again he said (page ........</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">135): “I am no longer in favor of long fasts. . . . If fasting is to be used at all, then start at first with the non-breakfast plan: then follow ' with the twenty-four-hour fast for a while; then......</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">gradually increase up to three, four, or five-day fasts, eating between fasts for one, two, three, or four days a mucusless diet.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As to elimination, Ehret said: “The sun bath is an excellent ‘invisible’ waste eliminator.” .................</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And he says: “My system is not a cure or a remedy, it is a regeneration, a thoro housecleaning, the acquisition of such clean and perfeet health as you never knew before.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For more than fifty years I have sought for information on health, and tried a great many ways of improving my own. But Prof. Ehret’s book has given me the most satisfactory understanding of the subject I have hitherto found. I know of nothing better. - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus and the Archbishop</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5">T IS with regret that we point out that there</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">is &amp;&nbsp;difference of opinion between Jesus, who is called Christ, and Cosmo Cantuar, who is called archbishop of Canterbury. Jesus taught His disciples to pray to His Father, and also taught them, with respect to this matter of worship, that they should call no man upon the earth by the title of Father, because one is their Father, which is in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The archbishop of Canterbury has changed all this. At least that is what we gather from the Canterbury Diocesan Notes, January, 1929. In these Notes, in his opening message, the archbishop says, “Let me therefore take the opportunity which these Notes give me as I begin my life as your Father in God and as we all begin a New Year to send a word of greeting to my brothers and sisters, my sons and daughters, in the one Family.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We trust that the archbishop’s elevation to the archbishopric has not injured his mind and caused him to become entangled mentally as to who is Almighty God and who is the archbishop of Canterbury. It would be sad if he became confused and had a hazy idea that the two are one. But Armageddon will straighten him out, if such is the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The archbishop looks wonderful in his lace night shirt, with the loose-flowing black </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">kim</span><span class="font5">ono over it. Take that, together with his black tie, and the cross and other fandangoes dangling from his neck, and that magnificent much-bejeweled totem pole with the cro-ss on top which he holds in his left hand when he does his caterwauling from the pulpit, and he is a very impressive sight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But, somehow, the simplicity of Jesus seems to us more impressive.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">UESTION:</span><span class="font5"> Do you believe in prayer? I never hear a prayer on your radio programs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font5"> Surely we believe in prayer. We ■ accept it as part of the Lord’s instructions, and strive to follow out such scriptures as, “Pray without ceasing” (1 Thess. 5:17); “continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving” (Col. 4:2); “watch, and pray, that ye enter not into temptation” (Matt. 26: 41); “after this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.” However, we also try to follow out the Lord’s instructions as to when or on what occasions and how to pray. Consuming time in praying aloud over the radio would be praying merely to be heard of men, and the Lord Jesus specifically forbade His followers to do that. He said: “'When thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues [churches] and in the corners of the streets [is not the radio more public and far-reaching than a street corner?], that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.” (Matt. 6: 5,6) Hence, those who have to do with broadcasting the gospel from WBBB and over the Watch-towes network do their praying in the privacy and secrecy of their own room or here in the studio before the radio program begins, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">not openly over the radio to show how religious they are or how beautifully they can form words and phrases in prayer. The radio programs over the watchtower network are not advertised as prayer meetings; nor is there any scripture in the Bible requiring that a public &lt;&nbsp;prayer be offered in the audience’s ears before a Bible lecture is given. There is no New- Testament record that Jesus offered up an audible' public prayer before addressing the multitudes <sup>_ </sup>who turned out to hear Him preach. When the Apostle Paul stood on Mars Hill and preached his forceful sermon to the Athenian stoics and............</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah and His Servant</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">[Broadcast from Station WBBR, New Xork, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH employs men to speak for Him who are humble and who give God the honor. This is for the good of men, because Satan’s policy is to give honor to men and to turn men away from God and cause their destruction. In the great drama set forth in the book of J ob here under consideration Elihu spoke in the name of the Lord and had the Lord God’s approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the picture, w’hom-did Elihu represent? Job had expressed his desire that he might be taught in the right way and understand wherein he had erred. (Job 6:24) When Elihu began his speech he made no claim that he was speaking his own words of wisdom, but stated that he spoke as the mouthpiece of Jehovah God and that he would ascribe all honor and glory to God. He said to Job: “Behold, I am according to thy wish in God’s stead: I 'also am formed out of the clay. Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.” (Job 33:6,7) Then Elihu added: “I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. For truly my words shall not be false; he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee. Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any; he is mighty in strength and wisdom. He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.”—Job 36:3-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this connection call to mind that when Jesus was on earth He said: “My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.” “The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.” “But he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him. ... As my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. . . . For I do always those things that please him.” (John 7:16; 6:63; 8: 26, 28, 29) Jesus Christ was God’s Anointed One, which means that He &quot;was commissioned by Jehovah to speak in behalf of Jehovah God. (Isa. 61:1-3) All those who have been brought into the body of Christ and anointed with the holy spirit of God are authorized or commissioned in the name of the Lord to speak His message concerning reconciliation of man to God. (2 Cor. 5: 20) The conclusion is therefore irresistible that Elihu in the picture represented God’s anointed witnesses. Elihu therefore pictured Christ Jesus the Head and also the members of His body. All these constitute God’s Servant, as it is written:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Behold my servant, whom I uphold; </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font5">e elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles [nations]. I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles [nations]; to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house. I am the Lord: that is my name; and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.”—Isa. 42:1, 6-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore, Elihu was a young man and therefore pictured the “young men” upon whom the Lord has poured out His spirit in these latter days since coming to His temple. Such are the ones who become God’s witnesses. (Joel 2:28) These are the “young men” who have taken their stand wholly on the side of the Lord God and against the Devil and his organization. The Lord’s inspired witness, writing of and concerning such class, said: “I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. . . . Because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one. Love not the world.” (1 John 2:13-15) These are the ones who are described by the prophet as “the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace”, and who tell of God’s great purpose of salvation and say to the people of the Lord: “Thy God reigneth!” They are the ones that constitute the “watchmen” who joyfully join together in a harmonious testimony to the name and purposes of Jehovah God.—Isa. 52:7,8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Elihu said to Job: “If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand [God’s anointed servant], to shew unto man his uprightness [to show man the right way].” Elihu therefore shows by his language that he pictured the “interpreter”, the “messenger” of God, the servant of the Lord God, who is God’s anointed and who is commissioned to speak the Word of God for the comfort of those of mankind who desire to know the truth. It is God’s anointed class that is commanded to “prepare . . . the way of the people; ... cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a stand-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ard for the people”. (Isa. 62:10) This prophecy applies specifically after the Lord takes His power and begins His reign, and after He comes to His temple and assembles Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Elihu therefore pictures the class to whom the Lord God said: &quot;Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he; before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am the Lord: and besides me there is no saviour. I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god among’ you; therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God.”—Isa. 43:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We may know that we have the proper understanding of a prophecy when we are able to apply to the words of the prophecy the physical facts which clearly appear and then find that they fit exactly. Seeing that the words of the Lord show that in the picture Elihu must have represented His anointed servant class, what are the facts showing the fulfilment thereof? The indisputable facts show that there is now on earth, and has been within the last few years, a class of men and women who are wholly devoted to God and His government of righteousness. These constitute His anointed servant class. The Lord came to His temple in 1918 A.D. It was in 1922, or thereabout, when His people began to see and appreciate the distinction between God’s organization and Satan’s organization. Particularly since 1922 the ones faithfully devoted to the Lord have been going forth with gladness in their hearts, explaining or interpreting the Word of God and telling the people who will hear of and concerning God, His mighty power, and His gracious provision to grant life to man by means of restitution; and pointing out to them that God has placed upon His throne His anointed King Christ Jesus, and that during His reign all the peoples and nations of the earth shall have an opportunity to be restored to life and live upon earth.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Jehovah Speaks</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Referring again to the picture that appears in Job: God was displeased with the three professed friends of Job because they had not spoken the truth. The Lord said unto Eliphaz the Temanite: &quot;My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends; for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">servant Job hath.” (Job 42:7)' The words of Jehovah here show that Job, a man of no pretentions, came nearer to speaking the truth, and . spoke much of the truth, whereas the three pro- .......</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">fessed friends of Job, who claimed to speak in the name of the Lord, did not utter the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How well the facts that have come to pass since that time fit the picture 1 The representatives of the Devil’s visible organization have claimed to _ speak in the name of Jehovah God. The clergy and their allies and the principal of their flocks have posed as the sole teachers of the Lord’s AV ord and as guides and advisers of the people. They have not spoken the truth, while many good honest men of the land who have desired to know the truth have found and spoken some truth, the latter being pictured by Job. The ecclesiastical systems have builded great and imposing structures which they call &quot;churches”; they have installed therein costly furnishings; they have caused to preside over these places the so-called great and mighty doctors of divinity; they have made the financiers and the professional politicians who rule the principal members of the congregation; and in these.................</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">houses called &quot;churches” the clergy have expressed their great &quot;-wisdom” and claimed to represent the Lord. They have in fact rep resented the Devil, because it is the Devil’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is true, doubtless, that many of these eccle- -.........</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">siastical organizations started out with the...........</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">avowed purpose of serving God; but they soon fell victims to the Devil; and the Lord caused His witnesses to write concerning such, and His words apply specifically to this day. (Jer. -2: 21-25) Babylon and Belial are the names of the Devil’s organization; and the ecclesiastical systems being a part thereof, the Lord says of and concerning the same: &quot;And what concord;. . hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believe th with an infidel? And what agree- . ment hath the temple of God with idols ? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch . . not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.”—2 Cor. 6:15-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In fact Christendom, so called, is a social and political organization, operated chiefly by the owners of great wealth, professional politicians who carry on their selfish, nefarious work, and the clergy who pose as God's representatives and urge the people to faithfully support and uphold such organization. Many good men and women who desire to know of God’s Word of truth are wholly in bonda.ge to these ecclesiastical systems. Elihu pictures a class whose privilege it is to inform them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What is said here with reference to the Catholic and Protestant systems applies with equal force to the Jewish synagogues. No longer are the people therein taught by the rabbis the Word of God as written and recorded by His holy prophets. They have substituted the -words of the &quot;fathers”, so called, even as the &quot;three friends” of Job advised Job he should study and follow such. These, as well as the Protestant churches, form a part of &quot;Christendom”, for the reason that the word “Christendom” is a misnomer. It is intended to be used to represent Christ’s kingdom, but is in fact a subterfuge to blind the people. It is really the Devil’s organization. There is no part of so-called “Christendom” that is teaching or making any attempt to teach the people God’s purpose to give man life on earth by redemption, resurrection and restitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s anointed class, sometimes called Bible Students, and which class was pictured by Elihu, is the only class of people under the sun who today are magnifying the name of Jehovah God and who give to Him the glory and are not giving glory and honor to men. These are telling the people of God’s way that leads man to life and happiness. There is every reason why this anointed and faithful servant class should rejoice and sing for joy, because of the privilege granted unto them to declare the name, majesty and loving-kindness of the Almighty God, and tell the people how their relief and blessings are coming through His kingdom. Never did man enjoy a greater privilege on earth than is now enjoyed by those who take a delight in being the witnesses for Jehovah God and in speaking to those who will hear and telling them about God’s great arrangement for the salvation of humankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It will be seen that the speech of Elihu was chiefly for the purpose of magnifying, and did magnify, the name of Jehovah. His testimony tells of the power of Jehovah, indicates the overthrow of the enemy’s organization, and tells of God’s reconstruction in the time of restitution. The voice is used as a symbol of a message. It is the servant class of the Lord that together lift up the voice, that is to say, harmoniously proclaim the words and message of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The lightning is a representation of the illumination of God’s Word, which He gives forth through the Head of His anointed class. In his speech Elihu said: “Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth. He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.” (Job 37:2,3) Thus he indicates that the message of truth, illuminated by the “lightning” of the Lord and under His direction, will go to the ends of the earth as a witness to the nations and people. Then he says: “After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard. God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend. Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north. He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy. Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God. And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds; but the wind pass-eth, and cleanseth them. Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.” —Job 37:4, 5, 9,13,14, 21, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In substance, Elihu here pictures a time when a strenuous and forceful witness would be given to the peoples and nations of the earth, telling of God, His excellency and His mighty purposes for the salvation of men; also telling of an approaching storm, the great trouble which is expressive of the indignation of God against Satan’s organization; also indicating that immediately following this witness, or even while it is in progress, the great storm or whirlwind breaks with terrific fury upon the earth, and that it passes and cleanses the earth, and then fair weather cometh out of the north. These words of Elihu foreshadow a great witness to the peoples of earth followed by the time of trouble, at the end of which restitution blessings would begin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus is indicated the time when the anointed servant class on earth must give a testimony</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">sia</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">concerning the majesty of God, His purpose of destroying Satan’s organization, and the bringing of life to the people through His government over which His beloved and anointed Son presides. The facts show that the anointed servant class is now giving that very testimony to the peoples of earth in obedience to God’s commandments, and that this must be done before the great whirlwind of Jehovah’s war breaks upon the nations of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The World War of 1914 to 1918, and the associated incidents, mark the fulfilment of the prophecy concerning the end of the world. (Matt. 24:7-22) That means that 1914 marked the time when the period of waiting would end and when the period of activity would begin against Satan and his organization. In verse fourteen of the above-cited chapter it is said that then must follow the testimony of the good news to the peoples of earth, to wit, that the world has ended, the time of God’s kingdom is at hand, and that this testimony must be given as a witness to the nations. Verses twenty-one and twenty-two of that same chapter state that then shall follow a time of trouble such as the world has never known and that this will be the last. That time of trouble is undoubtedly otherwise described by the prophets of the Lord as the battle of God Almighty. (Rev. 16:14) That will be the battle of God Almighty against Satan’s organization, and will mark the complete overthrow of Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is another reason why the servant class now on earth should rejoice to sing forth the praises of Jehovah’s name and to declare His works among the people. (Isa. 12:1-5) The physical facts that are now in progress in fulfilment of prophecy are further proof that Elihu represented a class that would be privileged to understand the prophecy at this time. God conceals the understanding of His prophecy until His own due time to permit it to be known. His people have not heretofore understood the book of Job; but now in the light of the unfolding of God’s purposes it becomes clear, and all honor and glory is given to the name of God. The revelation of the book of Job to God’s people is another evidence that we are rapidly approaching the great battle of Almighty God and, after it, the blessings of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As Elihu concluded his testimony the whirlwind broke in all its fury. Such is a symbol of God’s expressed indignation, against Satan’s organization. Concerning this the Lord caused His prophet to write: “For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city [organized Christendom] which is called by my name [Christendom claims the name of the Lord, but in fact represents the Devil], and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the Lord of hosts. Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The Lord shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth. A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the Lord hath a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the Lord. Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground. Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.” —Jer. 25:29-35.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Jehovah Is God</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">“Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said.” (Job 38:1) This describes the condition at the time that God makes Himself known to mankind. The whirlwind is a symbol of God’s expressed wrath against Satan’s organization. It is in this time of trouble that God will make the people understand who is the mighty and eternal One. Let us now give careful consideration to Job’s prophecy, chapters 38-41, inclusive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While “organized Christianity”, so called, is posing as the savior of the peoples of earth and is so doing by bringing forth peace pacts, League of Nations, and other makeshifts, there are many honest-hearted people of good will who have no faith or confidence in “Christendom”. These men, however, have not the knowledge of God’s purposes, and they have theories of their own as to how the Lord will bless them. They believe in the existence of God, but they have no knowledge or understanding of either His organization or the Devil’s organization. Among other things pictured by Job, he foreshadowed or pictured this class. The Lord speaks to this class &quot;out of the whirlwind” and puts to silence all the professed wise men of earth. He calls attention to the fact that He is the great Creator of heaven and earth, and shows that there is no other, and that He is the fountain of all wisdom, power, justice and love. His words show the utter insignificance of man and magnify the greatness of the Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What could be the purpose of Jehovah in thus speaking to Job, as set forth in chapter thirtyeight and that following? Having in mind that Job there pictured the people of earth who have respect for God, the purpose is to serve notice upon the people that Jehovah is God and that life can come only by reason of His provision made in mercy and loving-kindness. It is to convince all men of the truth that man has no power to bring about his own blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Before creation there is now, and there has been, the question at issue, Who is the great Supreme One? This issue has been made possible by the deflection of Lucifer, and by his effort to turn man away from God. Satan has diligently sought to blind creation to God’s greatness and loving-kindness. The Lord God has permitted the enemy to go his full length in this wicked attempt, and that is shovrn by the assault of Satan upon Job. Very few people on earth have any appreciation whatsoever of the importance of the statement that Jehovah is God. The great multitude of nominal “Christendom” think that they look to God, and their leaders speak His name, but their hearts are far removed from Him. Many who claim to be followers in the footsteps of the great Master think that they have an appreciation of God’s name, but have not. There are none on earth who have a full appreciation thereof. At this time the appreciation of God’s anointed people as to the meaning of His great name is increasing, and this is due to the &quot;lightnings” that come from the Lord, illuminating His Word. That is the reason why at this time God’s anointed people are commanded to give the testimony that Jehovah is God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When by His supreme power God brought the Israelites out from the oppressive hand of Egypt, He was teaching that people that He is God. Egypt symbolized the Devil’s organization, while Mount Horeb pictured God’s organization. The Lord God miraculously delivered the Israelites from Egypt and brought them to Horeb, and there He gave them His law or rule of action by which they would be governed and which points to the way of life. The great issue then was, Who is God? Whom shall we serve? The paramount part of that law which God announced to Israel at the foot of Mount Horeb was and is: “I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt,- out of the house'of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before me.” (Ex, 20: 2, 3) That declaration of God’s law was made for the benefit of man. It was for the purpose of teaching men that Jehovah is the only true God; and all who will ever enjoy life everlasting must receive it from the Lord God and must be obedient to His law. Again Jehovah emphasized the same great rule when He spoke to Job out of the whirlwind.—J oh 38-41.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And now Jehovah God is having His anointed people to serve notice upon the nations that He is the only true God; and this He will have done before the great antitypical whirlwind or war breaks upon the nations. A few will hear; the great majority will not hear; and then out of the time of trouble God will convince all that He is Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is expressly written that when God sent His beloved Son to earth He sent Him to provide the ransom or redemptive price in order that man might have life everlasting. (John 3:16,17) It “was this great and mighty Teacher who at the end of His ministry on earth said: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” (John 17: 3) That means, then, that no one can ever get life without knowing Jehovah God and His means of bringing life to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the time of the tragedy in Eden </span><span class="font4">until </span><span class="font5">1914 God has permitted the Devil to put forth his greatest efforts to turn creation from Him, It was in 1914, in harmony with the words of His prophet, that God said to His anointed One: ‘Go forth now and rule in the midst of thine-enemies.’ (Ps. 110:1,2) Since that time the Lord has been putting His kingdom in operation. He has been causing His anointed ones to specially give a testimony to the people that He is God; and this has been for the benefit of man and not for God’s benefit. The peoples of earth must be told that Jehovah is supreme, that He is the only true God; and they must know this in order that they may have an opportunity for life. This is proven by the specific words which God delivered to Job. That the testimony must now be given by the anointed is proven by the position that Elihu occupied in the picture. God has commanded that this testimony be now given; and no one could be pleasing to Him and acceptable to Him unless he joyfully participates in giving the testimony to the people. The Lord has provided the means whereby the testimony can be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To Job He says: “Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are?” (Job 38:35) Thus with terse but accurate language God tells that the radio is a manifestation of His power, and not man’s, and that He is presenting the message of truth by the carrier wave of the radio. His anointed servant class must now use, and is using, this particular means of proclaiming the majesty of Jehovah, the great Creator of heaven and earth, and tell</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ing the people of His purpose to give them life on earth. They are at the same time telling the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">people of Satan’s organization, how that oppressive hand will be removed and destroyed. <sup>7 </sup>Satan’s organization has arrogantly and presumptuously undertaken to monopolize the radio; but we may know that God will have that means of transmitting the message used exactly according to His sovereign will. Doubtless in His own due time the great God will cause His faithful servants, Abraham, David, and others, to stand in the city of Jerusalem and by means of the radio speak to all the peoples of earth, that they may hear and know that there is no God besides Jehovah. Then the people will be fully informed that to know Jehovah God, and to obey Him, means that they will be restored to the days of their youth and will live on the earth for ever. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Next Sunday the proof will be submitted showing Job’s restoration to all that he had lost, and what is the meaning thereof. In the meantime please read Job, chapters 38-42, that you may be better enabled to follow the argument as produced.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Story Forty-five</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">'' TESUS Knew that the Pharisees and chief priests of the temple at Jerusalem were anxious to slay Him, and, as His time was not yet fully come, He kept out of their way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He traveled into a remote part of Palestine, to a city called Ephraim, situated upon the edge of a wilderness. There He and His disciples lived for some time, until Jesus knew it was time to go to Jerusalem to lay down His life for mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the time came for leaving Ephraim, Jesus and His disciples began the journey to Jerusalem by passing through Jericho. In that place lived a man by the name of Zacchaeus, who was chief among the publicans of Jericho, and was very wealthy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now there was </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> great crowd assembled in Jericho, which surrounded Jesus and made His progress through that city very slow. Zacchaeus was in this crowd, and tried vainly to see Jesus through the multitude, but could not because the wealthy publican was very short of stature, in fact nearly a dwarf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At length Zaccheeus thought of a Avay whereby he might obtain a glimpse of Jesus, and he ran ahead of the crowd and scrambled up into the branches of a sycamore tree by the roadside. When Jesus came by that way, He looked up and saw Zacchaeus, and said to him, “Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down, for to day I must abide at thy house.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then was Zacchaeus delighted beyond measure to think that Jesus would honor him by staying at his house, and he scrambled out of the tree with greater speed than he had scrambled into it, and came down and they all went to Zac-chaeus’ house, where he received Jesus joyfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now the feast of the Passover was to be at Jerusalem, and six days before this event Jesus and His disciples came to Bethany, where, it will be remembered, Jesus had raised Lazarus, the brother of Mary and Martha, from the dead. The Lord was received most joyfully by Mary and Martha and was entertained at their house, and their once-dead brother, now sick no longer but in splendid health and strength, sat at table ' with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And many of the Jews knew that Jesus was there, and they flocked to see Him, and also to •see Lazarus, whom He had raised, from the dead. But the chief priests were such a jealous lot that they plotted to kill Jesus, for after the raising of. Lazarus many Jews forsook the teachings of the priests and followed Jesus, and of course the priests lost power and glory by that. But they could not kill Him yet, for His time was not come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then Jesus proceeded to Jerusalem, and there was a multitude of people that followed Him and His disciples all the way. These people cried with a loud voice, praising God and glorifying His name, saying, “Hosanna to the son of David! Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And when this great concourse of people, with Jesus in their midst, entered Jerusalem, the whole city was aroused, and said, “Who is this ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And the people answered as with one voice, “This is Jesus, the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.” .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then the Bible account says that “Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves. And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then the Pharisees came to Jesus in the temple, and were angry to see that He had thrown the lenders of others’ money out of the house of God; but they dared not lay hands on Him yet, for fear of the people, who thought Jesus was a prophet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But they tried to entrap Jesus in His conversation, that they might prove Him guilty of some offense before the law. So certain Pharisees went to Jesus and asked Him, “Master, . . . is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?” &lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And Jesus knew that they were trying to catch Him in a trap, so He replied, “Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? Shew me the tribute money.” Then one of them laid a penny before Him. And Jesus said, “Whose is this image and superscription?” And the Pharisees made an answer, “Caesar’s.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then Jesus replied, “Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s.”</span></p>
