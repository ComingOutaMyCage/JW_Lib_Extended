Anyone who can whittie can make marvelous “improvements” on the device, with which he can make still more marvelous “discoveries”, if he happens to be a spirit medium. The planchette and the crooked </span><span class="font3">-We print the following because </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> is in the nature of a forum wherein subscribers may express their convictions on almost any subject and be sure of a wide audience. Some will object to this presentation by Mr. Goodrich, and the same courtesies which have been extended to him will be extended to his critics, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">provided they explain the point which he raises as to what it is that makes that button stick or not stick, </span><span class="font3">so that a plain, ordinary man can understand it without having to stand on his head, and provided also the reply is not obviously an attempt to secure valuable free advertising.—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Editor. </span><span class="font5">by Dr. Abrams himself or by any of his colleagues or followers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let the reader be assured, in the outset, that the proof herein set forth is not the expression of human opinion about a system of therapy. It is a presentation of the stern and competent evidence of physical fact concerning a clever device of the Enemy to hoodwink mankind and to ensnare the people</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">stick of the water witch are common variations of the ouija-board. So far as this article is concerned, then, a ouija-board is any device by or through which communication with the spirit world is effected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The existence of such communication by human beings with the fallen angels or demons is freely conceded by all who know and believe the Bible testimony on the subject, and who are acquainted with the physical facts of modern spiritism. Furthermore, all Bible students know that such communication is absolutely contrary to God’s Law; and that such communication is inimical to the welfare of every individual who essays to “investigate” or tamper with it. The Scriptural and factual testimony as to the truth of the above statement is at once too voluminous and well known to be repeated here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this article proof is set forth that the ‘Diagnostic Machine of Dr. Albert Abrams” is ...... nothing more and nothing less than a complex ouija-board; that this said diagnostic machine cannot possibly be used to diagnose disease unless the operator thereof is a spirit medium; and, furthermore, that the whole theory known as the Electronic Reactions of Abrams, or* the “E.R.A.”, is an absolute farce, unproved and unprovable, the first scientific evidence in its favor never yet having been advanced, either of God. Furthermore, this presentation does not espouse directly or indirectly any one or more of the many new or hoary schools of healing now extant. In fact, these various schools of healing, in their great claims, in their miserable failures, in their glaring inconsistencies, in their grasping selfishness, and in their hopeless and helpless maze of confusion on the subject of health, so remind one of the similar characteristics of ecclesiasticism and her confusion on the subject of religion that one can with difficulty avoid the suspicion that they are all children of the same Daddy. The School of Healing herein espoused is that of Jehovah’s Great Physician, earth’s new King, with Whom are all the secrets of life, and Whose kingdom alone can bring health and happiness to man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The writer of this article is in a position to furnish affidavits, containing the names and addresses if necessary, in support of the physical facts here placed in evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. and Mrs. A presented themselves in Dr. B’s “Abrams Electronic Clinic” for diagnosis and treatment of the latter, who for more than a year had suffered a complete breakdown (sometimes called a “nervous breakdown”, and diagnosed variously by the doctors as “colitis”, “constipation,” “autointoxication”). She was very weak, and one wee hour in the day was all tha* she could stand in Her chosen work as a witness for Jehovah God. She sought treatment that she might have more time and strength for that great work. As critical scientific bystanders; let us observe with them what happened.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.855</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">Before them, on a table, was a very complex instrument, apparently electrical in nature, made up of a number of units, which exhibited perhaps a score of graduated indicator knobs, resembling rheostat knobs. Other details were a mysterious little wire a few inches high called an “aerial”, protruding from one of the units, and a small round cavity with a bright metal lid in the surface of the main unit. Across the top of this main unit, in bold letters, was this legend: “The Diagnostic Machine of Dr. Albert Abrams.” Most important of all, on the unit carrying the aerial, so called, was a black button or disc much resembling an auto horn button, except that it was solidly fixed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Doctor B explained briefly the theory of E.R.A., and requested Mrs. A to write her name on a piece of paper. Did any one ever visit a spiritistic seance or consult a clairvoyant and escape being asked to do that very thing? We are told that a drop of blood or of saliva would have done just as well, but the paper and pencil were handier. The pencil used was a public one, and the paper used was freely handled by everybody. The name written, the doctor takes the slip and cuts off the wee period only, at the end of the name, and, to show the super-sensitiveness, not to say the super-silliness of the machine, the dot only was cast into the cavity of the main unit, and covered with the bright lid. This wee dot made by Mrs. A, with a public pencil, was so impregnated, the doctor said, with electrons, vibrations or what not, that now the machine would not register any vibrations broadcast by Mr. A or any of the busy assistants and stenographers in the room!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now put on your “thinking cap”. Picture yourself as a scientist, watching those dear little vibrations busily emanating from the hand of Mrs. A as she grasps the pencil. Notice, too, those other billions of vibrations which previously emanated from the doctor, from his assistants, and from no telling how many previous patients, who have previously grasped that same wooden insulation on that same lead, as they chase like children playing hide and seek, so as to get themselves all safely out of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the way. The last little rascal jumps off the point just as Mrs A takes the pencil. The way for her vibrations is now clear. Behold how they run!!! She writes very quickly. How they did jump that wooden insulation^ and concentrate themselves by the billions on the very point of that lead!!! And why do they go to that trouble ? Because they know that only a microscopic amount of that lead on the point is to get onto ............. the paper, and they want to be “in” for the . fun. Now in every jot and tittle of that name they stand in solid phalanx at attention, ready to serve. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now watch those well trained electrons in the doctor’s fingers, as he picks up in his uninsulated fingers that bit of paper. Not one of his . electrons gets into the paper, or into the dot on .........</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">it; and not one of Mrs. A’s electrons gets out . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">of that period!!! Isn’t it wonderful!! Had the E.R.A. theorists stuck to the drop of blood or .....<sub>:</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">saliva they would have been richer in plausi- ~ bility; but this handwriting foolery leaves not the slightest camouflage of “science” to cover up all this monstrous twaddle. Yet such is the Abrams Theory at work. Nor does it end here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our scientific vigil must continue. Those dear little titans in the dot must now begin their work. What work? Their work of holding at bay all those similar or stronger vibrations emanating from Mr. A, from the various assistants in the room, as well as those from the doc- ... tor himself; but they must not hold back any of those coveted vibrations from Mrs. A herself. Some police job for those poor little incarcerated ’lectrons in the dot!!! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We pause to ask a few questions: How does anyone know that there are “electronic vibr.a-tory rates”? How do we know that they will penetrate wood? How do we know that such rates become permanently lodged in the lead -inside the wood penetrated? If they are thus permanently lodged in the lead, so that there are enough in one dot to do such marvels, why * do they all scamper away as soon as a new patient grasps the pencil? How do we know that they really do thus scamper? Then why do they not scamper when a new hand takes up the paper with the dot (for the paper is woodpulp)? On the E.R.A. theory that “like vibrations kill or neutralize like vibrations”, how is it accounted for that Mrs. A’s vibrations in the dot enhance or attract her own </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">like</span><span class="font5"> vibrations from her body, but powerfully repel all others, which are </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">unliTce?</span><span class="font5"> Why are these secondhand vibrations in the dot more powerful than all the full force of Mr. A’s healthy vibrations, which are beating incessantly upon the “aerial”? We submit that there is but one way to answer these questions; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">and that is by the unsupported fiat of human opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now the real work of “diagnosis” begins. All of Mrs. A’s “vibratory rates”, unhindered and untrammeled, emanate from brain and bronchi, from lungs and liver, from muscles and membranes, from corns and cornea, from bones and bunions, all, into that little “aerial”, to be scientifically caught, and scientifically measured; at least so the E. E. A. theory </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">says.</span><span class="font5"> We take this say-so with more than the ordinary grain of allowance, since the first simple scientific test or experiment showing even the existence of these vibrations is yet to be performed. There is more bona fide evidence that the moon consists of a freshly made cheese than there is in support of the E.E.A. theory; for the moon looks to be about the color, size and shape of a new cheese, but there is not that much similarity between the duodenum and a broadcasting station. There are millions of people who avoid stepping on an insect, lest they should crush ~ their grandfather; let us not be foolish enough to accept their gratuitous but unsupported opinion! !!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Hold on here!!!” comes the chorus from some thousands of E.E.A. practitioners and patients. “Do you not know,” say they, “that we can furnish you with authentic records of hundreds of thousands of cures effected by this method?” Without wasting time to hear their testimony, we will grant them, for the sake of argument, a whole million of well authenticated cures. Is that fair? All right. We will now turn to the Christian Scientists for proof that there is no reality in matter, and we get another million or so of “well authenticated cures”. We next turn to the “faith healers’’ and get some more thousands of testimonies to their prayers. We visit the Catholic shrine and find a great pile of crutches bearing mute testimony to that method. We now turn to China, to the Dark Continent, or to the South Sea Islands, and we are deluged with the efficacies of every conceivable fetish, loathsome decoction, and weird incantation. Furthermore, we must not forget the “well authenticated cases” of the witch doctors, the spirit mediums, the clairvoyants, and the magnetic healers. All this testimony, considered together, constitutes abundant physical fact to prove for all time, that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">cures do not prove theories about cures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. B calls us. “Come to the diagnostic machine,” says he, “and I will prove the theory of E.E.A. a thousand times a day!!” We return to his clinic, with Mr. and Mrs. A. Our scientific vigil continues. Dr. B now rubs the black button, with a handkerchief-covered forefinger, as he adjusts the knobs. Suddenly the forefinger adheres to the button, making a slight noise as it slips. He reads his indicators at the base of the knobs, and announces, “It is a beef worm, no, two beef worms, in the stomach.” After the administration to the patient of two glasses of water (charged up 20,000 strong with electronic magic), the doctor again rubs the button, and announces the beef worms moved to the duodenum, to continue their broadcasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While the electronic policemen in the wee dot prolong their valiant fight fdr Mrs. A’s vibrations, like Leonidas at Thermopylae, the diagnosis progresses to the main organs of the patient’s body. If the finger adheres to the button, then it is “this”. If the finger adheres not, then it is “not this”. After two and a half days of this “diagnosis” and “treatment” Mrs. A testified that she felt better than for nearly two years, restored to nearly normal health as by a miracle. This makes a total now of a million and one well authenticated cases for the E.E.A. Dr. B seemed to take a liking to Mr. and Mrs. A, and invited them on the next day, which was Sunday, to come in at the doctor’s leisure and study the whole thing through together. Evidently they had expressed just enough of their suspicions to be deemed worthy of a little personal work, to the end that they might be converted to the E.E.A. conception of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They accepted the doctor’s invitation, and for three solid hours they listened to his explanations, and freely asked questions. Here is Mr. A’s summary of the revelations of those three hours of study, verbatim as given by him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. B assured us that the Diagnosis Machine of Dr. Albert Abrams, used by him, was not connected to the house lighting circuit, and that it had no batteries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To the question, ‘What is the scientific reason for the handkerchief-covered finger’s adhering to the black button more at one instant than at another</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">T’</span><span class="font5"> The doctor answered, “Search me!! You Avill have to ask the makers of this machine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the doctor’s invitation, I myself tried rubbing the button repeatedly. If I pressed a little, my finger stuck, making the familiar slight sound. If I did not press, my finger slipped freely over the surface of the button, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">at all times.</span><span class="font5"> My forefinger had not come under demon control, as I now see it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For hours I watched with a trained scientific eye (for it happens that I had had eight years of scientific training, in the very lines here involved) the machine, the doctor, and his operation of it. I must say that I was much impressed with his whole-hearted honesty and sincerity. He was seemingly the very embodiment of generosity and humankindness; for all this work for my wife and me he insisted on doing entirely gratis, on account of the work we represented. However, I must tell frankly and truthfully just what I saw.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If unseen intelligences planned the handkerchief to so cover the forefinger that the casual observer would not notice what was going on, they failed in this instance, as the doctor, being honest, was not in on their secret. He held the handkerchief more or less tightly, so that all that went on was plainly visible to anyone who was there as a scientific observer and not listening much to the twaddle about beef worms in the stomach, or the relative normalcy of the colon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now get this: The doctor’s finger was constantly flexed upward loosely while silently passing over the button. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">But in every instance when the finger &quot;stuck&quot; it. had suddenly become flexed downward, with every evidence of the exertion of muscular pressure.</span><span class="font5"> Since its inception, the E.R.A. theory has stood challenged with this question: Whose intelligence operates that forefinger? Do electrons do it? If so, then electrons are unseen intelligences, demons or fallen angels. To call an evil or familiar spirit an electron does not change its nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. B went on to tell us that he had received from the makers of the machine a “truth” number; in other words the “vibratory rate of truth”. By the magic of this number, as we shall see, the complex machine was transformed into a simple “yes” and “no” ouija-board. For example, a patient’s telegram was traced, and the true and false words determined. The assistant was then called in and he traced the telegram with identical result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Again: When through the machine some supposedly marvelous therapeutic properties had been “discovered” in waters from certain springs, the doctor was advised, through the use of the “truth” number, to keep the “discovery” a secret until a certain date. Subsequent examination of papers in the bank revealed that date to be the date of the expiration of an option on the lands containing- the springs. Whose intelligence worked the forefinger muscles this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By the use of this same “truth” number, on this same diagnostic machine of Dr. Albert Abrams, Dr. B learned that an exception was to be made in its advised secrecy. The names of various Bible Students were presented to the machine, and thus certain ones were indicated to receive the secret in advance of other mortals. The place and time determined by the E.R.A. oracle, for imparting to them this secret, was to be at a certain Bible Students’ Convention. Alighting from his bus at the convention, who should confront him but one of the very ones indicated. Did not Jesus well forewarn, of things in these last days to deceive, if it were possible, the very elect?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Believing that both the advice and the “discoveries” coming from the machine were overruled or sent by Jehovah God, Dr. B did not renew the option on the land containing the “wonderful” springs, and thus those precious healing waters were saved from the hand of selfish exploiters. Even a plat of the land was made and presented to the machine, for its advice as to the disposal or use to be made of the various parts. Fullest details were thus received as to the conditions and purposes under which certain parts were to be sold; what parts were not to be sold; what buildings were to be constructed, and their location as well as the materials to be used; all this advisory information, and much more, flowed freely from Dr. B’s diagnostic oracle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We were told of the machine’s “expectancy” number. By the magic of this number, one’s expectancy of life could be determined at will, as judged by one’s present general vitality. “Recently,” the doctor confided, “I discovered that the expectancy of the majority of Bible Students was just thirty-two years. By further tests I found that my own expectancy would become 31, on October 15.” Of course the machine fulfilled its own prediction, exactly on time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. B told us at length of still other marvels being discovered by means of this diagnostic machine. But recently an Abrams practitioner, who was also interested in the work of the I.B.S.A., had discovered how to charge a bit of celluloid with vibrations of marvelous healthgiving power. From this machine this doctor had learned that it was the will of Jehovah God that the device be sold for just one dollar, and that it be not sold for any price to anyone not a member of the I.B.S.A. (!!!) How those blasphemous demons (or electrons) must have chuckled as they pulled this one over!!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I am heartily ashamed to tell it, but “an honest confession is good for the soul”, they say. Taken off guard, and in the interest of etiquette and peace, I actually took one of those little celluloid squares offered me by Dr. B, held it in the palm of my hand as directed, stretched it out toward a certain point of the compass, accepted a glass of water in the other hand, blew in the water (ten times, I believe it was) as commanded, and then drank down the water, still holding my magic square outstretched. &quot;While thus engaged I felt like a fool in a pantomime ; as I now look back at it I charge myself with being a fool in a pantomime. Can any one beat it among the practices of the fetish worshipers of the South Sea Islands?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Prepared by all this exercise for your diaphragm, you will be ready for the next “wonder” appearing in the spooky heavens of the Abrams theory. This time it is a little piece of aluminum, about six inches square, with certain holes in it; nothing more, and nothing less, unless it he some alleged billions of those spooky electrons, alias “vibratory rates”. These were stored up in the aluminum plate on the “widow’s cruse of oil” plan, always being given off, yet not depleted. And all this storing up of vital energy was accomplished by the diagnostic machine, which is admittedly “dead” without electrical connection or battery. My! One wonders what it would be able to do if it were only connected to the socket!!!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Continuing the “study” with us, Dr. B told us how a glass jar of water or a sandwich placed upon this little aluminum wonder gets all charged up shortly with vibrations of health 20,000 strong. We were further told in all seriousness that the doctor who had discovered and invented these bits of trash conscientiously thought that Jehovah God had brought it all about, and furthermore that the great Creator had announced to him, by means of the “truth” number on the Abrams machine, that a certain man was to be taken in as a business partner in the manufacture and sale of these aluminum squares. Furthermore, that the Almighty would have it to be sold for just a certain price, and that it was His will that the profits be divided or, a certain percentage basis!!! Jehovah restoring the race to health by metal squares with four holes in them!! Yea, verily; and announcing in advance the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">price thereof,</span><span class="font5"> and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">division of the profits withal,</span><span class="font5"> and forbidding the device’s being brought out before a certain date!!! Again the demons (or electrons) chuckle loud and long, “What fools these mortals be!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There you have it! Jehovah the great Creator, dragged down from the skies, to barter health to all, and to dictate the division of the profits. And all of this, and much more, “proven” by rubbing a button. If your finger sticks, it’s “yes”. If it doesn’t stick, it’s “no”. Oh, that mountebank Joker of the E.R.A. technique, The Button!!! If a clearer case of spiritism is on record, where, I ask, shall we find it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So much for what Mr. and Mrs. A saw and heard in one Abrams Electronic Clinic. Here is what we get from another similar institution in reply to a letter, with which was enclosed a copy of Mr. A’s data, substantially as given above. The letter was short and to the point, calling upon the manager of the clinic for what he had to say particularly concerning what Mr. A had called the “Joker” of the E.R.A., namely, the button, the examination of which overturns the whole Abrams theory, bunk and baggage, until scientifically accounted for by something other than muscular pressure, which means spiritism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are two single-spaced pages of elite typing in the clinic manager’s reply. It is wonderfully well written. It contains evidence that the writer is versed not only in grammar, rhetoric and logic, but also in the tenets of the Abrams theory. He is able to cite </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ad libitum </span><span class="font5">earth’s great and various authorities in the medical world to his purpose. In fact it is doubtful if Dr. Abrams himself, if living today, could compose a letter better adapted to camouflaging the real issue, and covering up the total absence of scientific proof. More eloquent by far, however, than all his rhetoric and logic and citation of “authorities”, was </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">his utter silence on the subject of rubbing the button,</span><span class="font5"> which is the whole thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here is his whole argument, boiled down: (1) If a chair or table were used as a ouija-board by a medium, it would be wrong to condemn all chairs and tables because of that fact; why condemn the Abrams Diagnostic Machine because some doctor misused it? (2) The medical world has rejected the Abrams theory; the medical world is always wrong, therefore the E.R.A. is right. (3) Thousands of great medical and other men have become great Abrams enthusiasts ; therefore it is a proven scientific method of diagnosis and treatment. (4) Wonderful therapeutic results are obtained by the Abrams method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Any mind that is trained to think accurately will at once note that these four arguments, taken separately or together, are worth exactly </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">nil,</span><span class="font5"> because: (1) To make proper use of a chair or a table, one does not have to have the forefinger muscles operated by an unseen intelligence ; but to make use of the Abrams diagnostic machine, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">such extraneous control is necessary.</span><span class="font5"> (2) The second argument is entirely eaten up by the third in truly proverbial “dog eat dog” fashion. But were it not thus disposed of, it is false anyhow, and would fall of its own weight, without comment.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">(3) Here we get a good “close up” view of the whole matter of human “authority” as “proof”. Human authority never did and never will prove anything but its own inadequacy. The great scientific medical world is all wrong, but some of its great leaders are E.R.A. enthusiasts, hence the E.R.A. is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">proven right!!</span><span class="font5"> Absolutely anything can thus be proven. For example: John Smith, your next door neighbor and lifelong friend, conies in to show you his new gun. After deliberately loading it, he jumps aside, takes aim, and shoots and kills your wife. He brings a thousand “character witnesses” into court to prove, and does prove to the court that by some hook or crook you were mistaken. John Smith was really too good a man to do it. How many more human opinionators will it take to prove it to you? In the last analysis, then, human opinion or “authority” is worthless to an argument. Physical facts are worth everything if a matter is to be proven so that it will stay proven.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(4) Number four is, if possible, even worse. Thousands honestly give their opinions as to the benefits of vaccination, serum, operations, tanlac, peruna, salts, calomel, osteopathy, chiropractic, naturopathy, et cetera, and then some. But, on the other hand, there are just as many thousands who are just as honest who will shout .....-—</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">even more loudly a solemn warning against the use of each and every one of these same panaceas. Although the testimony upholding the E.R.A. and based upon “cures” is thus seen to be based upon worthless opinions, yet, granting the truth of these, it falls again the second time, and that without remedy; for here come the marching multitudes of similarly well authenticated cures proving the holy bone therapy, the Eddy therapy, and all the rest. If your headache is cured by getting the idea that you have ~ no head, and therefore no ache, does the cure prove the theory? If you get well after an Abrams treatment, does that prove that a dead .. machine, which never does anything but lie still . and be rubbed, has accurately measured billions of vibrations? In fact many people have gotten well after writing a letter, or after combing..... <sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">their hair. Would this prove that letter-writing......</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">and hair-combing produce billions of healthladen electrons? Or would all of these ridicu- . lous theories about cures, and the voluminous testimonials to the efficacy of each, rather tend to prove to the rational mind that in the start the great Creator caused the human body to be “fearfully and wonderfully made”; and that in spite of all the follies of fallen men, these old bodies have a wonderful power to “come back”, regardless of all the mistreatment that, men or devils can invent?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To satisfy some further questions that may arise, we dig a little deeper, for more evidence, and happen upon the report of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Scientific American’s</span><span class="font5"> E.R.A. investigation committee. What is herein quoted or alluded to is found in that journal for March, 1924, page 159 ff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Immediately someone objects: “I would not believe anything published in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Scientific American.”</span><span class="font5"> We are glad for this frank objection in the start, because that objection, consistently accepted, destroys the last vestige of scientific foundation for the Abrams Electronic Theory. “And how is that?” do you ask? Because the very existence of electrons has been</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">discovered or hypothecated only by the ultra-scientific men, whose latest findings are sought and published by such journals as the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Scientific American.</span><span class="font5"> We hold no brief for these scientists or their journals, because their wisdom, according to divine prophecy, has become foolishness, and they have bowed themselves down before Evolution as their god. We gladly agree that their opinions, offered as expert witnesses, could be only as “wind and confusion”, worthless as proof. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That these scientists are at least of average honesty, will be conceded. Unless we accept the testimony of honest men as to physical fact, we can get nowhere on any subject of inquiry. It is therefore because some crumbs of physical fact fall from these “great” men’s table, that we are interested therein. We care not a whit for their opinions. Confessedly these investigators of the E.R.A. were flabbergasted at the facts as they found them. In proof of their honesty, their fair-mindedness, and their lack of ill-will toward Dr. Abrams and his followers, we read in their report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The E.R.A. practitioner, to all appearances, is enabled to diagnose the state of health of any individual from the blood specimen of that individual, or </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">even from the handwriting.</span><span class="font5"> He can not only determine the present diseases and ailments, but also those diseases and ailments which may develop in the future, and which are now present in the incipient stage, and impossible of detection through orthodox methods, even including pathological examinations and X-ray explorations. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">He can, if he is as competent as Dr. Abrams was, determine the religion of the individual from the blood specimen. He should be able to locate the individual at any given moment.</span><span class="font5"> (Italics ours.) He should be able to tell the nationality of the individual and many other pertinent facts, always from the drop of blood, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">or from the handwriting alone.</span><span class="font5"> But should a scientific body, such as our investigation committee, endeavor’ to make a simple test, which would prove, once for all, the basic truth of this bizarre procedure, we are immediately informed, much to our surprise, that such a request is unreasonable. We are asking too much! Even Dr. Abrams expressed his surprise at such a request.” And again: “So the wonderful feature of E.R.A. is that it has been accepted without any proof whatsoever, of its basic truth.” ' .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Note that neither this committee nor any one else has ever found the first fact which would prove that organs or organisms give off electronic or other vibratory rates like a broadcasting station. It is high time for this pseudoscientific sham of pure demonism to be known for what it really is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We know that Professor Mi</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">llik</span><span class="font5">an is a fallible man, because, some twenty years ago, the writer found an error involving a principle in his High School Physics textbook, and the professor admitted his error, too, and promised to correct it in the next edition. Viewing him, then, as an honest man acquainted with certain physical facts, and not as an “authority”, we place the following paragraph also in the evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“No less an authority than Professor Millikan, probably America’s greatest physicist in the field of the electron, investigated the Abrams apparatus, and stated that it did not rest on any sort of scientific foundation whatsoever. Professor Millikan holds that the E.R.A. claims are the height of absurdity. If it is true that the electrons inside of the atoms give off, under suitable stimulation, frequencies of definite period, which are properly called electronic frequencies, then these frequencies are billions of times higher than any which the E.R.A. are using in their treatment, so that the word ‘electronic’ in connection with the Abrams method is misleading and unscientific. If there is anything in the E.R.A. technique, it is certainly not electrical or magnetic.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If it be argued that Mr. Millikan here offers his fallible opinion, we answer that opinion is all there is to be had on the subject of electrons. When a man knows science and the Abrams apparatus, and says that the two do not agree, he states a physical fact, not an opinion. The opinion relates to the nature and existence of electrons; the physical fact relates to the disparity between the E.R.A. and the whole structure of physical science. Be it noted, then, that whether the opinion be true or false, and whether the whole structure of physical science be true or false, yet in either case the E.R.A. must fall anyhow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some readers, however, are fond of the opinions of men. We therefore ask such to compare and determine in their minds the relative values of the opinions of men like Professor Millikan and the opinions of the author of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New Concepts in Diagnosis and Treatment,</span><span class="font5"> one of Dr.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark47"></a>QOLDEN AGE</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Abram’s late standard works. Concerning this book and its author we read in the above cited report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Early in our investigation, we obtained a copy of this work, and try as we would to understand its seemingly significant contents, we had to give it up as impossible. It proved to be an incoherent hodge-podge. . . . Dr. Abrams knew virtually nothing about electricity. We doubt if he could have hooked up a door bell, and made it work.” Proof of this statement is cited on page 272 of the book mentioned, where the author’s diagram fully corroborates the statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Again: “On page 187 we find this wonderful statement: ‘The voltage of the latter is usually very high, and varies from 2 to 17 ohms.’ For the benefit of those not acquainted with electrical terms it is here pointed out that equal sense is expressed in the following sentence: ‘Her morning walk is usually very long, and varies from 2 to 17 quarts.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After citing a number more of these puerile inaccuracies, and scientific vagaries, the report goes on to give instances of how Dr. Abrams could invent, and use with facility, great pseudo-scientific terms, with which to impress the scientist and daze the novice. This is a very common thing in literature of demonistic origin. Theosophy, Christian Science and Koreshanity are three examples of this. Our committee’s report sums it up thus: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The whole thing bears striking resemblance to the subjective psychic phenomena.”</span><span class="font5"> (Italics ours.) Yet the committee is quite positive that the whole thing is not a barefaced fraud, and that those connected therewith are sincere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After calling attention to the fact that scientists have precision instruments, which make their own readings, and are therefore truly accurate and scientific, the report says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“But the Abrams practitioner does not have an instrument that makes its own readings. He has to set,the indicator to a given index; then he goes through a procedure which in effect answers ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the implied question as to whether that rate is present. And the means of getting the answer is itself objectionable, in that it consists merely of the doctor’s getting a certain sensation. It takes the form of a changed tone on tapping the reagent’s abdomen ; or a sense of greater or less roughness as the finger tips are passed over the skin; or the degree to which a glass, rubber or wooden rod sticks when thus passed. Though it may have taken him six months to acquire the ability to ‘get’ the reactions, he may lose this temporarily or permanently, overnight, especially if he begins to doubt the technique. A spectator with a skeptical turn of mind is apt to drive the reactions away, especially if he voices his disbelief. (The psychic member of the staff interrupts to remark, ‘Where have I heard that before?’) This gives strongest grounds for asserting that the whole thing is psychic.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We submit: There never was a spectator skeptical enough to deflect the radio waves from a receiving set; but there have been lots of spiritistic seances spoiled by the presence of such spectators. When scientific worldlings who know not God or demons can approach that near to the truth, it is surely high time for Bible Students to recognize and flee this spiritistic snare of Satan, crying aloud, and sparing not.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font5">N THE iron-mining regions of northern Wisconsin there is a large, privately-owned light and power company that charges the small consumer’ 12c a kilowatt hour, whereas the large concerns, such as the mines, etc., pay only 3c a kilowatt hour. On the other hand, the farmers have to pay a straight service charge of a little over $3.00 a month, whether they use any light or not. The cost to the company, I am informed, is six mills a kilowatt hour!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In view of the fact that the city of Winnipeg (Canada) is furnishing power and light to the individual consumer at rates of 1c and 3c, respectively, a kilowatt hour, it follows that the charge made by the Wisconsin company is not only exorbitant, but barefaced robbery. How long the people will put up with such conditions is hard to say, though no doubt a knowledge of the truth along these lines as well as others will help to set them free.</span></p>

Prison riots have become so common as to be a national disgrace. It is generally admitted that the prisons of the country are antiquated, dark, damp, cold and unsanitary, and that clothing and food are both insufficient. In ten years the prison population of the United States has increased from 73,546 persons to 121,646. Forty-three percent of the inmates of federal prisons are there for violation of the liquor laws. In Texas a man was given a life sentence for stealing thirty cents and a piece of pie. None of the men who manufacture electric current at less than three-quarters of a cent a kilowatt hour and sell it to the common people at a dozen times its cost are yet in prison. Two hundred federal prisoners have been contracted to the State of Georgia to be used in building roads.

<p><span class="font5">HIS is the title of a book just published in England. It is written by Robert Graves, who served in the Royal Welsh Fusiliers in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">France in the Great War. Since the publication of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">All Quiet on the Western Front</span><span class="font5"> there have been an overwhelming number of war books published. While these perhaps do not furnish us with matter of a nature which we would read for enjoyment, nevertheless they present to us facts which need to be faced. War is portrayed in all its hideousness, but the redeeming feature is that the reading of these books produces in the hearts of men the desire for a time when war shall be no more and men shall dwell in harmony one with the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By A. J. West (Estlwnia)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The book, will doubtless cause a great deal of comment, for the writer is fearless in his denunciation of the methods employed in the Great War and the depths to which the belligerents sank in order to bring it to a successful conclusion. That lying was freely resorted to is a fact of which most people are aware, and to Avhich reference has previously been made in the columns of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. Graves writes: “Executions were frequent in France. My first direct experience of official lying was w’hen I was at the base at Havre in May, 1915, and read the back-files of army orders in the officers’ mess at the restcamp. There were something like twenty re-</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The grimness of war is shown in the fact that cowardice (so called) was punishable only with death, and no medical reasons could be advanced for justification. Instances are quoted in the book to show that this army order was rigidly carried out even with men who had become maddened because of the heavy bombardment. Mr. Graves tells of suicides, of officers shot by their own men, and of officers who because of dipsomania were no longer capable of making clear decisions and consequently caused the needless destruction of their forces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The limit of callousness seems to have been</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">reached in one incident recorded of the reporting of two junior officers to their superior cers. This occurred after a terrific shelling dur- ■ ing which great heroism had been manifested by the two officers in the rescue and care of....... &quot;</span></p>

When they came to report, the— — colonel did not offer them either food or dri</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">n</span><span class="font5">k, -but just issued some further instructions.

<p><span class="font5">Such is the effect of war upon the hearts of men. No wonder the Scriptures speak so definitely of the time when the Lord’s indignation will be manifest against the great unrighteous organization of the Devil, and then through the -operation of God’s kingdom the instruments of destruction and hate will be turned to good use <sup>1 </sup>in the promotion of prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">R</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">obert Quillen is making it hot for warmakers. In a copyrighted article he points out the interdependence and the natural friendliness of American workers and workers beyond the seas, the customers of each other’s goods, and then says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But a few men called statesmen, who think of peace and war because that is their trade, and are filled with dreads unknown to other men, exchange bitter notes because of some wrong done by a few irresponsible individuals, and at last lose their reason and declare war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With them it is a kind of heroic game, but they play it from afar. Their pens scratch on paper—a safe business that does not endanger their skins—and at once the world is changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The two workers who were friendly in spirit because they had need of one another are now enemies. They must prepare to kill one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They have no desire to fight. They much prefer go</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Christian Scientists Seek to Suppress the Truth</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font5">HE Bible tells us that there are only two masters, Jehovah God and Satan, and that those who are not serving God are in the service of Satan. Satan has a wicked, corrupt organization on earth, through which he has always opposed the work of Jehovah and persecuted those who were engaged in that work. Few people are aware of the fact that such an organization exists, and great numbers of honest people are allied with this organization and cooperating with it in its efforts to suppress the truth, and are not aware of the fact that the Devil is its founder and promotor. The following correspondence is published for the purpose of helping these deceived ones to see who is the enemy of God and His people, and thus help them get free from the service of this enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The right to fully and freely discuss doctrines, creeds, and the views and beliefs of public men, when those doctrines, creeds, or beliefs have been made public, is a right recognized by the Scriptures, and by the fundamental laws of all civilized nations, except such nations as are governed by tyrants. The Constitution of the United States guarantees these rights to all its citizens, and these rights are recognized under the oft-repeated phrases, “freedom of the press,” “free speech,” and the right of “public assembly”. Anyone who denies or attempts to abridge such rights is a menace to the liberties of the people and is not a one-hundred-percent American citizen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus exercised these rights, even going to the extent of saying to His opponents, “Ye are of your father the devil.” (John 8: 44) In Acts 13:10 Paul called Elymas the sorcerer a “child of the devil”. Thus we can see that it may become necessary at times to w’arn those who are deceived into serving the Devil, by calling their attention to the fact. This should be done, however, with a desire to assist the deceived ones to see their danger, and not with a desire to ridicule or scoff at their doctrines. The latter would be wrong and unchristian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All tyranny, oppression, persecution, suppression of the truth, denial of free speech and public assembly, or attempt to abrogate the liberties of others, are of the Devil, and those who do it belong to the organization of Satan, whether they know it or not. If they do not know it, then we. are justified in publishing these facts for their enlightenment and blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By B. H, Barber</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has always been the religious elements that have made use of this weapon of persecution, intolerance and suppression. They did it in Jesus’ day; they did it during the “dark ages”, and they are doing it still. Until quite recently, Christian Scientists have measurably refrained from cooperation in these methods of opposition to liberty of discussion and freedom of speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On September 29, 1929, a lecture was broadcast over the Watchtower network, on the subject, “Why So Many Religious Denominations?” That lecture contained these words: “Some people who have spent their lives in pain or illness desire a religion that will give them health, and so Satan has several of these to appeal to their weakness. With most of the devotees of these various religions, the all-important thing is the gratification of their fad’, or ‘fancy’, or ‘hallucination’. Thus the Devil tries to suit everybody.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the conclusion of this lecture, Mr. Ralph B. Textor, who is the “Christian Science Committee on Publication” for the state of Ohio, telephoned a protest to Dr. A. W. Ostrander, who is vice-president of Station WHK, of Cleveland, Ohio, which was one of the stations in the network. On October 4, Mr. Textor confirmed his telephone protest by letter, which we publish herewith, together with the reply to the same. It will be noticed that Mr. Textor was not exactly accurate in his charge, and that he places himself squarely against the discussion of doctrines and teachings of the various sects, and in favor of shutting off the privilege of telling the truth over the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus Christian Scientists take their stand on the side of the suppression of liberty, the denial of free speech, and opposition to proclaiming what the Bible teaches. They are opposed to having the people know that Satan has a wicked organization on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among other things, Christian Science denies the Bible teaching that there is such a thing as sickness, pain or death; it also denies the personality of God and of Satan, claiming that God is simply “good principle”, and that Satan is simply “evil principle”. Now it has definitely and positively taken its stand on the side of intolerance, and suppression of the truth, and would if possible close all avenues for the discussion of the most important facts in the uni-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">verse, namely, the great truths of the Bible, and those doctrines which misrepresent those truths.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">117 Adams Street Brooklyn, New York October 22, 1929 Mr. Ralph B. Textor,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Christian Science Committee</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">on Publication for Ohio,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">308 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">My dear Mr. Textor:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your letter of October 4 to Dr. A. W. Ostrander, of Station WHK, Cleveland, criticizing my radio lecture of September 29 on the subject “Why So Many Religious Denominations?” has just reached my desk, and I hasten to reply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your criticism is that I said that ‘ ‘ Christian Scientists are angels of the devil”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A review of that lecture shows that I did not mention “Christian Scientists”. I carefully avoid personalities in my lectures; and so far as possible I avoid reference to any particular denomination or sect. However, I claim the right to discuss the tenets, or doctrines or teachings which are set forth by any person or body of persons. This is a constitutional right exercised by religious, political, financial, industrial and social leaders of our day. Even the views of the President of the United States are properly subject to criticism and discussion, and are continually criticized and discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">My subject was a proper one and, I notice, is being discussed from many pulpits today. The Bible teaches that there is only one church, and since we are treated to the spectacle of about 160 different sects or denominations, with clashing creeds, it becomes a subject .......</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">that every honest man who loves God should be glad and willing to discuss, in order to ascertain if his is the true church. I certainly am not ashamed of any such discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bible sets forth that there are only two masters, Jehovah and Satan, and that those who are not serving the living God are serving His great enemy, Satan, no matter how honest they may be in their convictions. We are told that one cannot eat at the Lord’s table and the table of devils. (1 Corinthians . . 10:21) We cannot serve two masters at the same time. It becomes a question, then, before which every other question on earth pales into insignificance: At what table are we feeding or feasting ? Which master are we serving?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Any person who honestly tries to show us that we are sitting at the wrong table and serving the wrong master is a friend and not an enemy. He is trying to show us that we are serving the wrong master, and he should not be accused of “throwing rocks” as you suggest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not only is the right to criticize doctrines and teachings a constitutional one, and exercised continually by everybody, but we are warranted in using ths same by no less an authority than Jesus Himself. I remind you that He told the religious leaders of His day that they ‘taught for doctrines the commandments of men’. (Matthew 15:9; Mark 7:7) If Jesus ' had broadcast that talk over Station WHK I am wondering whether you would have telephoned in to stop Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since the right of free speech and free discussion ~ is a Scriptural one, and guaranteed by the American A Constitution, and exercised by everybody, why do you try to deny me the privilege of exercising that right?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To attempt to deny the right of free speech or free discussion of important questions is distinctly un-American and nn-Christian. Surely you do not mean to imply that I should submit my lectures to the Christian Science Committee on Publication for Ohio, to be censored by them!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The faithful servant of Jehovah has but one aim, and that to serve Him. That is the Christian’s mission. To perform faithfully his commission he must speak the truth in love. (Ephesians 4:15) He must also expose the error. To do otherwise would brand him as being unworthy of being called a Christian. ...............</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now, my dear Mr. Textor, I submit that in my lecture there was not a word spoken that was unscrip-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">tural, mi-Christian, unethical or un-American; and hence your criticism was entirely unjustified, as well _ incorrect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Again I assure you that I have no desire to offend, nor to hold the beliefs of others up to ridicule; but I do have an earnest desire to defend the truth and to expose all error, to the end that God may be glorified and the honest-hearted delivered from the error.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the spirit of fairness, I extend to you the same privilege, and if you can show me that I am teaching wrong doctrines, I shall welcome such information. I have only one copy left of the address in question, and shall be glad to send it to you for perusal and return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Very cordially yours,</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">W</span><span class="font5">E DO not in the least mind seeing some other publisher besides ourselves take a rap at the Christian Science censorship. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New Republic</span><span class="font5"> has recently well ventilated this monstrosity of bigotry by calling attention to the fight between </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Scribner’s</span><span class="font5"> * and the Parent Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It seems that on page 44 of its by-laws </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Church Manual</span><span class="font5"> provides that “A member of this church shall not patronize a publishing house or bookstore that has for sale obnoxious books”. If you can match that for bigotry, you will have to go some.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In practice it &quot;worked out that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Scribner’s</span><span class="font5"> had a book by Edwin Franden Dakin entitled </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Eddy,</span><span class="font5"> and put it on sale all over the United States, but few bookmen dared sell it. In various cities and towns over the country the booksellers -were intimidated by letters from Christian Science churches, notifying them in substance that “We will have to desist from patronizing your company unless the book be removed from sale”, and a desperate but not altogether successful effort was made to completely kill the book. It is impossible to have anything but contempt for an oligarchy responsible for such methods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In its review </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The New Republic</span><span class="font5"> has an interesting paragraph on Christian Science pretensions as to size of membership and the facts on which they are based:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Recently, a Christian Science official reckoned the number of Christian Scientists in the United States at 10,000,000. The 1926 United States Church Census placed the number at 202,098. At the time these figures were made public, the Mother Church Board of Directors stated, “the number of adherents who are not members is estimated as exceeding the number who are.” Church officials, however, will not furnish, or take, a census of the Church membership.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Christian Science Espionage Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">U</span><span class="font5">NDER the high-sounding name of “Christian Science Committee on Publication”, for this state or for that, our Christian Science friends maintain intimidation bureaus, the effect of which, and the evident object of which, is to prevent free expression of opinion in the public press regarding the fraud of which Mother Eddy was the patron saint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Devil is so clever that if he can get men to turn away from God by picturing Him as a fiend, and the author of a great plan for everlastingly torturing men, he pushes them to the other extreme by trying to persuade them that there is no such thing as pain, and that when you jam a sliver under your finger nail “All is good, there is no evil”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To be sure, Mother Eddy had a dentist treat her aching tooth, and had medical attention at other times, yet there are plenty of people who have as much confidence in her infallibility (despite numerous changes in her books) as today have confidence in the kidnaping of Aimee MacPherson, or the inspiration of Mother White.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But let anybody, directly or indirectly, refer to this system of juggling with words, and he will hear from it directly, even as we shall hear from this. Eve means “evil”! Oh yes! Adam means “a damn”! Certainly! You can laugh about it up your sleeve; but mention it, and you are a target right away for the espionage bureau.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The joke of it is that the Christian Science people had a wonderful row among themselves, and a faction of them are or were fearful of everlasting destruction if they even looked inside of their own papers; yet the effort to prevent other people from saying what they think goes merrily on, as robust as ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Elsewhere in this issue we present an article on this subject by R. H. Barber, which we are</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">sure all will enjoy. Appended to it is a copy of a letter from the espionage department, and of Mr. Barber’s reply thereto. We are glad to offer Mr. Barber the freedom of the press, guaranteed by the Constitution. We are glad Mother Eddy had nothing to do with the preparation of that document. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let the M, D.’s Be Fair, Too </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By K. Williams (Ontario)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font5">N YOUR issue of December 11 you published an article, “Let Us Be Fair to the M. D.’s,” by Harold L. Dawson. The subject matter was presented in a very fair, capable and true light, but by no means does this plea clarify the situation to such an extent that a scathing arraignment should be lifted from one of the most powerful trusts in the land, the American Medical Association.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. Dawson is indubitably right when he points out that no system of healing is perfection in itself. Anyone who has thoroughly investigated the different philosophies of healing finds that each of them is working with some proven element of truth, and that each is also bound with its own peculiar narrow limitations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Where does the major fault lie for such a condition of affairs as this? Let anyone who is in physical suffering desert his medical practitioner and try some other plan of relief. Let us suppose it succeeds and the patient reports back to his physician that he was cured by other methods, what is the reception to this information? The physician’s nose quickly lifts in lofty and scornful disdain at the sheer imbecility of such nonsense. Never does he step down from his lofty pedestal and make an impartial investigation as to why he failed and the other man was successful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No human being can offer an adequate defense for the high crimes and misdemeanors that have been and are being perpetrated under medical science. Every sick or dying person should have access to every effective curative agent. To withhold them is a crime before God; and medical science not only withholds them, but continually casts aspersions and ridicule upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For centuries medical science has had power and control. Our personal liberties are frequently interfered with because of their false philosophies. Under their jurisdiction have come the greatest of our educational centers. Political power has been used to dig into an almost impregnable position. The wealth of great men has poured into their laps. The press is subservient and an able propagandist agent. Hospitals, sanitariums, and research institutes founded on taxation of the people, are maintained for their exclusive use. Yet with all these   great favors the simple truths of the basic principles of life are withheld from them. Their crimes are repaid with blindness, yet it is suffering humanity that pays the hideous bill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many noble men in the medical profession today are well aware of the lies, fraud and malpractice indulged in by members of their association, but are powerless against the strong--— clique -who hold control. They would like to preach the truth, but the important channels of enlightenment are closed to the masses. Medical science, in every instance, has had the opportunity to accept the principles of the different healing cults as they have been discovered, but one and all were rejected. Power and false doctrines intoxicated them. It is a lamentable picture to see almost daily in the press new discoveries heralded by medical rnen, the basic principles of which were enunciated forty or fifty years ago by earnest students of natural law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Strange, is it not, that an exact parallel of the bedlam and confusion which exists in the realms of physical healing is apparent also in the realms of spiritual healing? The established clergy, with its position, churches, wealth, institutions of learning, political power and control of the people, allows the individual to die spiritually rather than nourish and save him with the unblemished truth. In both systems adoration of control and power is more sought after than physical or spiritual redemption. To the unprejudiced and critical eye there is little to differentiate between them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Straight of the Yeast Question </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. W. E. Reynolds</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font5">HE man who recommends yeast cakes, saying “they contain all the vitamines”, has evidently been reading the full-page advertisements of the Yeast Company, backed up, of course, by good (?) medical authority!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the first place, this “vitamine” rigmarole is a figment of the medical doctor’s imagination, just another unproven theory of the medical profession. No vitamine has ever yet been chemically isolated. All the data they have is that certain foods contain </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">something</span><span class="font5"> which other foods do not contain, and which, when put to the acid test of experimental dietetics, show certain results. Once to admit that that “something” they call vitamines was the something which the medical world had been calling “ash” and ignoring all these years, and was in reality </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">organic mineral salts,</span><span class="font5"> something which can be chemically isolated; to admit this, would in effect admit the correctness of the Nature Cure (drugless) physicians and the error of allopathic medicine, a thing which in the very nature of things we can not expect the allopaths to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the second place, it is an easily proven fact that good (?) medical doctor’s authority may be had for a great many things known to be harmful to mankind; as, for example, the deposed city health commissioner of Chicago, Dr. Bundesen, M.D., whose book advising the feeding of candy may be had from any big candy manufacturer. Some sixteen thousand medical doctors are on record as favoring the use of tobacco, and especially cigarettes. (See any “Lucky Strike” advertisement of May or June, 1929.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yeast, like candy and cigarettes, is made to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">sell.</span><span class="font5"> Don’t ever overlook that point. With this lengthy preamble, now for the “straight of the yeast question”, as I see it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the first place, what is yeast? Yeast is a plant, a near relative to the mushrooms. It is a fungus which makes rapid growth, as do all mushrooms. Yeast grows in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ferments,</span><span class="font5"> and, in the process of growth and decay, makes alcohol and throws off gas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you should undertake to manufacture alcohol in the privacy of your apartments, you would be violating the Volstead Act, whether you were arrested or not. If you manufacture alcohol in your stomach and small intestines, it is still alcohol; and the deadly effects of alcohol internally made is pretty apt to be as deadly as the effects of alcohol externally made and taken internally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yeast is advised because of the enormous amounts of gas it generates, which keeps the intestines distended, thus making it possible to overeat on wrong food combinations still further without completely clogging the small intestines and colon and causing death. Man has sacculated intestines, that is, intestines with little pouches or sacs along the sides. These pouches or sacs get filled with gas and distended beyond normal; if kept up for any period of time, an abnormal condition develops which results in invalidism and premature death. True, there are instances on record where people have taken yeast for several months, or even years, with no seeming disadvantage and with seeming benefit, but those are only the exceptions which prove the rule. We have record of men, and women too, who have drunk alcohol to excess, used tobacco and snuff, eaten all sorts of wrong food combinations, and still live to be nearly a hundred years old. When I read of such examples, I merely wonder how long those marvelous people might have lived had they lived right!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you want to plant a garden, plant it in the ground, not in your intestinal tract. Eat the right kind of foods in the right combination and you will not have constipation; and constipation is the only excuse for yeast eating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Mary Ann</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">W</span><span class="font5">E HAVE before us a little eighty-eight-page book which contains some remarkable information. It is about Saint Ann, the alleged mother of Mary, and page 55 assures us that Mary was “conceived without stain of original sin”. At first it was only Jesus who was thus conceived, then it was Jesus and Mary, </span><span class="font2">375</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">and now it is Jesus, Mary, and Ann. If we keep on going back we shall finally get all the way back to Adam and find that we did not need any Savior after all, since all in Jesus’ line, and therefore in every other line, were conceived without stain of sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The book refers to Mary as the Mother of</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">God, and to Saint Ann as the grandmother of Jesus. The inference is plain. St. Ann was the &quot;grandmother of God”. The reasons why we should pray to Saint Ann are set forth on page 17: “Is it not the general practice among men ■who desire favors from some potentate or man of influence, to send a committee to make the request?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From page 31 we find that for saying “Jesus, Mary, Ann”, one gets 100 days’ indulgence each time. This, it may be explained to the startled, is to be said only according to a certain pious ritual in connection with eighteen beads, as set forth on page 43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It seems, according to the little book, page 47, that there is a Saint Ann’s Oil. At first it is only pure olive oil, but then you exorcise the oil and order “all diabolical power and assault, ......</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">all satanic phantasms”, etc., out of it, and, after that, what a salad oil it makes! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Barnum was right! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<div><img src="g_E_19300305_files/g_E_19300305-23.png" alt="" style="width:16pt;height:21pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">QUESTION:</span><span class="font5"> My question is concerning the kingdom of God: Who is an inhabitant of that kingdom if “the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than” John the Baptist, when none born of women was greater than John?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font5"> This question is based on Matthew 11:11,12, reading: “Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding, he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By these words Jesus admits that John occupied a great office in God’s organization, because God used John to introduce the heavensent Messiah, the Christ, unto the world (Matt. 11:9,10). Great as Moses was, and also the other prophets, yet they did not have the particular service of actually announcing the presence of God’s anointed King, Christ Jesus; hence John was, as Jesus Himself said, “more than a prophet. For this is he of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, although John held such a high position, and was faithful unto death as a martyr and witness for God, yet the words of Jesus plainly show that this will not put John into the kingdom of heaven. And if none of God’s faithful witnesses who lived before John were greater than he, neither will any of them be in the kingdom of heaven. That also excludes from the kingdom of heaven all those of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">race of mankind, without a single exception, who lived and died before John the Baptist’s.......</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">day, and also those who like John the Baptist died before Jesus’ death and resurrection and ascension to heaven and the pouring out of God’s holy spirit on the day of Pentecost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">John and all the rest of these will never get to heaven and behold the face of Jehovah God the Creator and of Jesus Christ His Son now in heavenly glory. But why not? Because John . the Baptist and all the other prophets and the race of mankind who died before the day of.........</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pentecost were merely “among them that are born of women”; whereas Jesus Himself told .....</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the ruler Nicodemus that “Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be <sub>: </sub>born when he is old? can he enter the second ..........</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">time into his mother’s womb, and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh: and that which is born of the spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.”—• John 3:3-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">John the Baptist was never ‘Torn again”; he was never “born of water and of the spirit”; hence, having never been born of the spirit he could never be spirit or spiritual and go to the spirit realm of heaven. In the resurrection he must come forth from the grave as, at most, a man of “flesh and blood”; and as such he cannot get into “the kingdom of heaven”, because, as 1 Corinthians 15:50 says, “flesh and blood can-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. not inherit the kingdom of God.” In other words, John the Baptist was never a Christian or a faithful follower of Jesus; he preceded rather than followed Jesus, and died before Jesus was glorified in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Only those begotten and anointed of God’s <sub>:</sub>_________ spirit, and who as such are faithful unto death,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">....... will ever receive the heavenly “crown of life” and sit with Jesus in His throne in heaven and thus be a member of the kingdom of heaven. —Rev. 3:21; 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The book of the Acts of the Apostles, chapter - two, shows that none of the followers of Jesus were anointed with God’s spirit as Jesus was, . until the day of Pentecost, about three years after John the Baptist’s death. Consequently, there were no Christians before that particular day of Pentecost, because </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christ</span><span class="font5"> means “anointed one”, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christian</span><span class="font5"> means a follower of Christ Jesus who has been anointed with the same spirit of God as his Leader Jesus was. Of course such a one has also been begotten of water and the spirit as Jesus was at the time . of Jesus’ baptism in Jordan’s waters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Apostle Peter tells us that to such Christians “are given . . . exceeding great and precious promises; that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature”, God’s own nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(2 Pet. 1:4) Being faithful unto death, they -will gain “glory, honour, and immortality”.— Rom. 2: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">_ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus’ reference to those who shall sit imme</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">diately on His right hand and on His left in the kingdom of heaven (Matt. 20:23) suggests that there will be different positions in the kingdom, according to the earthly faithfulness of the individual Christian; nevertheless, “he that is least in the kingdom is greater than” John .. the Baptist, as you can now easily appreciate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">John the Baptist can at most be merely a perfect human being upon this earth; and the Apostle Paul shows in the book of Hebrews, _ chapter eleven, that John the Baptist and all the prophets of God before him will be raised . from the dead as perfect human beings, but that God has prepared “some better thing”, or reward, for faithful Christians than mere human perfection.—Heb. 11: 38-40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">■ </span><span class="font5">&nbsp;Although John the Baptist and the other ~ prophets, some of them being human forefathers of Jesus, will never get to heaven and be heavenly kings with Jesus and reign over mankind during the thousand years of Christ’s kingdom, other scriptures, such as Psalm 45:16 and Isaiah 32:1, show that John and his fellow prophets will receive the gift of life through Jesus and thus become His earthly children, and will be made “princes in all the earth”. As such they will serve as the visible representatives on earth of the invisible kingdom of heaven, and will thus be subordinate to “the least in the kingdom of heaven”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus also they will have a part in straightening out the affairs of the human race and in uplifting the family of mankind and assisting them back to reconciliation with God through Jesus Christ, and thus back to perfect human life eternal, in an earthly paradise. The words of Jesus, as-first above quoted, constitute one among many Bible proofs that not all those who are saved to eternal life will go to heaven, but that some will be saved to eternal human life in paradise restored to this earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font5"> Does the death of Jesus mean that those who died before Him will live again?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Answer:</span><span class="font5"> Yes! Otherwise not a single person who died before Christ’s crucifixion would ever have a chance to gain everlasting life on this earth. Jesus said: “I am come that they might have life, and . . . have it more abundantly.” (John 10:10) His ransom sacrifice was laid down primarily for Adam, because Adam’s perfection in Helen required Jesus to be a perfect man. All of Adam’s children were born since his sin and expulsion from Eden, which accounts for their sinful and dying condition. Hence it is that Jesus, by His one perfect sacrifice, redeemed not alone Adam but also every one who has died or is now dying due to Adam’s original sin. Hence the Apostle Paul says: “The man Christ Jesus . . . gave himself a ransom for all.” (1 Tim. 2: 5, 6) “That he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.” (Heb. 2: 9) “For as in Adam’all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.” (1 Cor. 15: 22) Jesus had not yet died when He said: “The hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth . . . unto the resurrection.” (John 5:28,29) This must therefore include all who went into the graves before Jesus’ crucifixion. Hence all the dead, non-Christian and heathen, must come forth from their tombs in order to hear and “come unto the knowledge of the truth”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why Evil Permitted</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">[Broadcast from Station WBBR, New York, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">J</span><span class="font5">EHOV</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">AH</span><span class="font5"> is the only true and almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He is the Creator of heaven and earth. The Bible is His Word, and it is the truth. The statements made here are based upon the Bible. It declares that Jehovah is almighty in power, perfect in wisdom, equal and exact in justice, and is love. Every good gift is from Jehovah. All of His ways are right. He hates wickedness, He is never unkind, and every act of His is prompted by unselfishness. He is the God of peace. To know and obey Him means to receive life everlasting in a state of complete happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many have had difficulty in believing these statements about the goodness of God. They say, ‘The world is full of sorrow and woe. There is so much crime and wickedness amongst men. If God is just, wise, and all-powerful and loving, why would He permit such evil to be carried on amongst the people?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A great cyclone sweeps a city of the south. Millions’ worth of property is destroyed, and hundreds of lives snuffed out. A terrible flood follows and overflows the banks of the Mississippi Biver, working havoc among the people, destroying many lives and much property. These were charged against God; and believing the charge, many people cursed Him for the calamity. The charges were false, as I shall presently show.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The daily papers are filled with accounts of thefts, bribery, rape, arson, murder and other crimes. There is great wickedness in high places, resulting in oppression and suffering on the part of the people. Many ask why God should permit these things to exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A man and wife are happily united. They try to serve God. They have sweet, beautiful and obedient children. An epidemic of scarlet fever comes and lays its withering hand upon the children, and they all die. The clergyman officiating at the funeral remarks somewhat to this effect: ‘These were dear innocent children. God wanted them and He took them away to heaven.’ To this statement the broken-hearted mothercries: ‘Why should God do that? Surely He does not need my children. If He were a just and loving God He would not have taken them away.’ Thus Jehovah God is charged with conniving at all manner of crime and with actually taking away loving children from their</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;378</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">parents. The charge is wrong and slanderous, even though ignorantly made. Jehovah God is often slandered and His name is defamed by men who really desire to do right. Their ignorance of the truth causes them to reproach His holy name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘But,’ says another, ‘if God is all-powerful, wise, just and loving, why would He permit such wicked things to come to pass and men to even ignorantly defame His name?’ We want to have the Bible answer to these questions, because the Bible is true. Understanding the truth, men will no longer have excuse to reproach God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">False Answer</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">First, I shall briefly consider a false answer that has long been believed by many. That answer often given is in substance this: That God has not prevented evil, but that He has permitted it for these many centuries in order that men might learn by experience the exceeding sinfulness of sin and that angels might learn similar lessons by observation. That answer does not assign an adequate reason for the practice of evil, and is therefore wrong. If God has permitted evil in order for men to learn the baneful effects thereof, then it must follow that all the evil in the world has been and is by the consent and connivance of Jehovah and that therefore God is responsible for ^uch evil. Many have thus reasoned and have thereafter refused to hear .anything further about Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We know that at least a half of the human race has died in infancy. Of the other half, at least ninety percent have died mentally infants, regardless of age. The permission of evil could not have served to teach any of these beneficial lessons. AVhen the resurrection of the dead begins, then evil will be restrained. If any one then wilfully does wrong, he will die for ever. Therefore none of the lessons learned by experience will have brought profit to any who thus die. Nor will it bring profit to others by observation. Those who know and obey God will live for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">True Answer</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The true answer to the question concerning evil must be consistent with the just and loving God. The Bible gives that answer; and now</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>GOLDEN AGE</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">let us learn it and rejoice in the truth. Our joy will not be in the evil itself or in its practice, but in that which shall follow by reason of the goodness of God. First, I state briefly the reason for the permission of evil and then shall prove the correctness of that statement from the Bible. Jehovah has not restrained the operation of evil, and to that extent has permitted it, for the reason that He might in His own due time fully demonstrate to all creation that He is the only true God; that He is just, wise, all-powerful and loving, and that He is the Giver of life everlasting, and without Him none can live. His word and His name are involved, and the vindication of His word and name are of far greater importance than any lessons that might be learned by His creatures. Please follow carefully now the history of the human creation as given in the Bible, and see why Jehovah’s word and name are involved in the evil amongst creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God created Adam the first man perfect. (Dent. 32:4; Gen. 2:7) He told man that he could have all the blessings of earthly life if he would continue obedient to and in harmony with the righteous Creator. Man was given a perfect home, and Lucifer, one of God’s spirit creatures, was given the oversight of man. (Ezek. 28:14) It is the nature of man to worship God. Lucifer desired that worship for himself. He, therefore, became a traitor to God and led man into sin and death, that he might accomplish his selfish purposes. God then changed his name, and since then he has been called by the names Dragon, Satan, Serpent and Devil. Concerning him it is written, in John 8:44, that he is a liar and the father of lies, and a murderer from the beginning. He is the one that is responsible for the operation of evil in the world. According to the Bible testimony this is the manner in which he proceeded:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan reasoned that if he could turn men and angels away from the worship of Jehovah God he, Satan, would receive that worship himself. To accomplish that purpose he must discredit God’s word and bring reproach upon His name, knowing that by so doing His creatures would lose faith and confidence in Jehovah. The word and name of Jehovah, therefore, became involved in his wicked course. God by His word had declared that if man disobeyed Him he should die. Satan reasoned in this manner: If God does kill man, by so doing He admits that He is unable to make a man that will maintain his integrity; and then His other creatures will no longer believe God to be perfect in wisdom and almighty in power. If man sins and God does not kill him, God thereby makes Himself-a liar, and that will cast reproach upon His name and destroy the faith and confidence of His creatures m God. Evidently Satan thought he was wise enough to defeat God’s purposes. In answer to the statement of Eve that the violation of God’s law would result in death, Satan said to her: “Ye shall not surely die: for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.” (Gen. 3:4,5) Satan thereby put the word of God in issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures declare that Satan deceived Eve, who then violated God’s law, and that Adam, because of his selfishness, joined her in the wrong, and both suffered the penalty of the law: expulsion from Eden, and death. God had endowed man with the power to produce children. This power man did not exercise before his sin and expulsion from Eden, but afterwards. The result was that the sinner Adam begot his children in sin and they were brought forth in iniquity. Such is the plain statement of the Scriptures in Psalm 51:5 and in Romans 5:12. All men, therefore, have by inheritance suffered sickness, sorrow, and death, and Satan has been and is the chief one amongst sinners, and plunged all the human family into sin and death. He has continued to cast reproach upon the good and great name of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But, God being all-powerful, why did He not kill Satan at the time and stop the operation of evil? He could have done so, and would thereby have proven His supreme power and His exact justice; but it would not have proven the perfect wisdom of God or that He is love. He could have destroyed the wicked creatures and created others; but, had He done so, this would still have left room for doubt in the mind of other creatures concerning His perfect wisdom and love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For some time this radio audience has been, considering the Bible account of the experiences of Job. That record fully illustrates the conflict between Satan and Jehovah, and shows how it will end, and how it will result in complete vindication of Jehovah’s word and name and in the blessing of mankind. As Satan said concerning Job, so in substance he said concerning mankind: ‘Jehovah, You cannot make a man that will maintain his integrity toward You; and if You will keep Your hands off me, I will make all creation curse You to Your face.’ That was a challenge to Jehovah, putting in issue His word and His name, and must be settled once for all and settled right, for the good of all creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If Satan could convince all creatures that God is not supreme in power, perfect in wisdom, exact in justice, and wholly unselfish, then he wrnuld turn all creatures away from God. Satan has succeeded in turning the majority of men away from God, and many angels have fallen; but in His own due time Jehovah God will demonstrate to all creation His own supremacy, and that He is just and at the same time the justi-fier of all those who serve Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan knew that God had created the earth for man’s eternal home and that He had made man for the earth. (See Isaiah 45:12,18.) He knew that all perfect creatures would worship and magnify the great name of Jehovah, and therefore he concluded that in order to defeat Jehovah God’s purposes he must turn man away from God. He challenged God’s word and reproached His name. The reply of Jehovah thereto is found in Isaiah 55:11: “My word . . . shall not return unto me void; but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.” “I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.” (Isa. 46:11) Jehovah, therefore, said in substance to Satan: ‘Go and do your worst; but in My own good time I will prove to all creation that My word is true and that My name shall be unsullied.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">His Purposes</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The careful student of the Bible now sees that from the very beginning it was the purpose of God to recover man from sin and death by means of redemption and restitution; that He is carrying out His purpose, and the means to accomplish it is by and through the great sacrifice of Christ Jesus, the selection of His body members, the establishment of His righteous kingdom, the complete overthrow of Satan and all wickedness, and the establishment of complete righteousness in the earth. The Scriptures declare, in Acts 15:18, that ‘known unto God were all His works from the beginning’. Orderly and majestically God has moved on to the accomplishment of His purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the meantime God has not put a restraining hand upon Satan, but has let him go the limit. We are now in that day in which God declares Satan’s limit has been reached, and that...... -</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He will shortly destroy Satan’s powerful organization and completely restrain the evil one. That is the reason why the time has come to understand the truth, and the reason why those who do see the truth are privileged to tell their fellow men about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the meantime Satan has gone on with his wickedness. He has caused great storms, floods,......</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">fires and other calamities to follow upon men and has seen to it that his agents have charged Jehovah God with the responsibility for such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures show that death came upon man <sub>: </sub>by reason of sin, and that Satan put the same . into operation, and therefore Satan is the one . guilty of death. The world has been steeped in murder and other crimes, and wickedness now runs rampant; and the Scriptures declare that Satan is the father of lies and of murder, and the one who has incited and caused all other murders. The enemy death has laid its cruel hand upon babes and the parents alike, and the result is that billions are sleeping in death. The Scriptures conclusively prove that Satan, and not Jehovah, is responsible therefor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During all these centuries while He has been bringing to pass His purposes God has kept His word and His name before men that those who love righteousness and hate iniquity might prove their loyalty to Him and maintain their integrity toward Him. The masses of mankind are turned away from God, but from the day of Abel until now there have been a few who have . remained true and faithful unto Jehovah. Not only has Satan been guilty of all crimes mentioned, but he has obtained control of the organizations of men created in the name of the Christ of God, and is now using them to defame ITT: the name of Jehovah. These organizations teach the precepts of misguided men and hence know not the Word of God. The Bible is the truth, and in it is written that man must be sanctified by the truth. (John 17:17) Amidst all the crime, evil, fraud and deception practiced by Satan there have been some who have steadfastly held to the Word of God. Now we are entering the time when all men will be given a full opportunity to see and understand that God is true and that His name is holy and the very symbol of life everlasting. For this reason the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">tim</span><span class="font5">e has come for the people to take their stand on the side of Jehovah, if they would know the truth and live. To inform the people of these facts is the one reason for broadcasting this message of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">- His Word</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">' God has kept His Word before those who have desired to know Him. Long ago His prophet</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrote, in Psalm 138: 2: “Thou hast magnified</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">~ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy word above all thy name.” Through an</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">other prophet God declares that in His due time His name shall be exalted in the earth. Briefly, the Word of God discloses that He has made</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">~ these promises and that He will carry them out, to wit: That He would raise up a ‘seed’ by and through which He would bring blessings to all mankind; that He would send to man a great Deliverer, who was foreshadowed by Moses in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sub>;</sub> delivering the Israelites from the bondage of Egypt; that He would send to earth His beloved Son, who should become the Ransomer and Redeemer of mankind and who would bear the sins of the people; and that the moving cause for all of this is love; that by the death of His beloved Son the redemptive price would be provided that would lift the curse from man „ and give man an opportunity to be reconciled to God and live for ever; that God would select . from amongst men a few faithful ones who amidst persecution and trials would maintain their integrity and faithfulness to God, and that these should be witnesses to Jehovah God; that He w’ould mark the end of Satan’s rule and that it should be followed by the reign of Christ, resuiting in the blessings to the people. These great declarations of His Word God has fulfilled by facts well known to many. God’s Word has not been found void; but fruitful, even as He promised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">...... His Name</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s name has been reproached by Satan from the very beginning. In mockery and derision he has caused the people to call themselves by the name of the Lord. Today there .....are hundreds of organizations which take the name of the Christ of God, but these honor Satan and do not honor Jehovah, because Satan has blinded them to the truth. It is written in Psalm 33:12: “Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah.” Where is there a nation of the world today that has Jehovah for its God? There is not one I Many nations call themselves Christian, but every one knows that they are far from being such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As the Bible and the physical facts show, Ave are now in the last days; and God declares that at this time He would have a people on earth ’who would be His witnesses and be used by Him to serve notice upon the rulers and the people of His immediate purposes. For this reason there is today a little anointed company of men and women who are going from house to house preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God by word of mouth, and presenting it to the people in printed form. This they are doing, not to get members or money, but that the people might know the time draws near when God will vindicate His word and His name before all creation; that this He will do by destroying the evil organizations, restraining crime and all evil in the world, and by establishing righteousness amongst men, to the end that all may know the truth; that thus He will lift the hand of oppression and wickedness from the people, and let the light of His truth shine into their hearts that they may know He is the God of justice, wisdom, love and power and that all those who know and obey Him shall live for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is in no wise responsible for evil. Satan is responsible for all wickedness. Jehovah God has permitted Satan to follow his own wicked course until His owm due time to stop it and to establish His own righteous government. Because that great crisis is at hand Satan is putting forth his last desperate effort, and the Lord in His Word says to the people: “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, . . . for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” (Rev. 12:12) In the great battle of the day of God Almighty, shortly . to follow, Satan’s power and his wicked rule shall perish for ever. The righteous government of Jehovah by and through His Christ will take charge of the affairs of earth, lift the oppressive hand from mankind and bring everlasting peace and the blessings of life, liberty and happiness to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And now, reverting to the reason why God has permitted evil: Has He thus permitted the enemy to go on with this wickedness in the earth in order to teach men the exceeding sinfulness of sin? I answer, No. He has not restrained the enemy Satan, but has let him go the very limit of wickedness, biding His own good time to carry out His purposes to vindicate to all creation that He, Jehovah, is the only true God and that He is the true and almighty Friend of those who love righteousness and want to live. Through His prophet He says to the people (Isa. 45: 22, 23): “Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none else. I have swrnrn by myself, the word is. gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.” He does this, not for a selfish reason, but that all intelligent creatures may know that the only way to have life everlasting in a state of happiness is to know and obey Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The prophet also foretold what the people shall say when they come to know the truth. In Isaiah 25:9 it is written: “And it shall be said [by the people] in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.” And again says the prophet: “And [Jehovah] shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one Lord, and his name one.”—Zech. 14:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The prophet represents those who have come to know God and who have full faith and confidence in Him, as saying: “0 Lord, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth” (Isa. 25:1-4) Thus is expressed the sentiments of the people and their appreciation of the almighty power, perfect wisdom, exact justice and unfathomable love of Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As further proof that the vindication of God’s •word and His name is the chief reason for the permission of evil and the recovery of the human race therefrom, His prophet wrote, in Ezekiel 36: 22,23: “Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God; I do not this for your sakes, 0 house of Israel, but for mine holy name’s sake, which ye have profaned among the [nations] whither ye went.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the [nations], which ye have ™ profaned in the midst of them; and the [nations] shall know that I am the Lord, saith ' [Jehovah] God, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was Satan who caused Israel to prove unfaithful to Jehovah. The Israelites were God’s chosen people and foreshadowed what God will ......</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">do for all people who turn to righteousness. If . He recovered Israel for His own name’s sake, then with stronger reasoning has He permitted evil in the world, not for the purpose of teaching His creatures the exceeding sinfulness of sin, but that He might establish for ever His glorious name before all creation. These great truths exalt Jehovah in the minds and hearts ~ of honest men. They can see that He has not permitted humankind to suffer in order to learn.....</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">lessons, but has permitted Satan the enemy to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font5"> his full limit that in due time all the people might see that to follow' Satan’s -ways means death and that to follow God’s righteous vmys means life and peace. ’Ultimately the lovers of . righteousness will join with the prophet in these &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A few faithful Christians on earth today see these wonderful truths and have devoted themselves to the Lord and have been anointed of Him as Jehovah’s witnesses. They delight to go from house to house and preach the gospel of God and His kingdom that the people might be informed concerning God’s purposes of rid- . ding them of oppression and bringing to them. _ the blessings of life and peace through the ministration of His kingdom. Ultimately all of this shall work to the honor, to the praise, and to the everlasting glory of the great Jehovah ....: God. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;________</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the next occasion of my speaking here I shall tell you of the Scriptural philosophy con-ceming the outworking of God’s gracious purposes, as the same relates to the redemption of man from death and all its attending evils. Then shall follow others upon the means of the vindication of the word and name of God for the good of man and to His ovm glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Children’s Own Radio Story </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By C. J. W., 'Jr. </span><span class="font5">Story Forty-seven</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">N</span><span class="font5">OW the place where Jesus reproved the scribes and Pharisees for their falseness was near the treasury of the temple. Many people passed by that place, going in and out, and some dropped offerings of money into the treasury of the temple. This money was used for<sup>7 </sup>the upkeep of the temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There were all classes of people who made their contributions to this treasury, but none were forced to do so. All the offerings were entirely of free will, and some rich people gave large sums, and others much less than they could really spare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But among the throng were many who could not part with any money, for they were of the poor. One of these was a poor widow<sup>7</sup>, who lived alone and had but a scanty living, amounting to but two mites, or a farthing, which was not much money in those days, and would be worth little now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus gave His disciples an excellent lesson in faith and devotion by the example of this widow. The Bible account of this reads thus: “And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“And there came a certain poor widow<sup>7</sup>, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing. And he called unto him his disciples, and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury: for all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now the temple in Jerusalem was a very great place, and was composed of several large buildings, connected by courts and passages, and built solidly and well. It had stood for about forty-six years, and seemed as if it would last for ever. But a day was coming when it would be wholly destroyed, together with the great city in which it stood. Jesus knew this, and when, as He came out of the temple, one of His disciples said, “Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!” He said to him, “Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus here had reference to something which was to happen, and did happen, many years after, when God permitted foreign hordes to overrun Jerusalem, and they destroyed the ancient city completely, overthrowing the massive temple, and scattering-the stones upon the ground. This came as a punishment to the Jews for having rejected Jesus when He was among them. Jesus knew, by the power of the holy spirit, that these things would happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then Jesus took His disciples up into the mountain which lies back of the city of Jerusalem, and which is called the Mount of Olives. There He instructed them privately in the signs by which they would know His second coming, when His kingdom should be established, and told them many things of the wonders of God's Word and His purpose to relieve and bless all suffering humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And now the feast of the Passover was again at hand, and the chief priests and scribes and Pharisees sought eagerly a way to kill Jesus, but they feared the people, who were daily following Jesus in greater numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We remember that Jesus had foretold that one of His disciples would betray Him to the priests. This disciple was Judas Iscariot, in whom the spirit of the Devil, or Satan, entered, so that he began to plot how he could deliver Jesus up to the priests and receive a reward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So Judas went and saw certain of the high priests and Pharisees, and laid plans to betray Jesus; and they agreed to give him a reward of thirty pieces of silver when by means of him they had captured Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then Jesus and the twelve chosen disciples sat down to eat the Passover in a certain house. It was the last meal that Jesus ate w<sup>7</sup>ith His faithful followers, and as Pie had told them this was so, an atmosphere of sadness and sorrow hung about the place wherein they sat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the disciples, Simon Peter, seeking to show his devotion to Jesus, said, “Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.” But Jesus answered him, and said: “I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day-, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For Jesus could read the hearts of those present with Him, and He knew that Peter meant well, but was weak; and in our next story we shall see how true was Jesus’ prediction that Peter would deny Him thrice.</span></p>
