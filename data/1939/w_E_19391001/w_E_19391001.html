<p><span class="font3">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power In heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act ail men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“To me belongeth vengeance, and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.&quot;—Deut. 32:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">JEHOVAH will “pay off” the enemy, and of that there is not the slightest doubt. His Paymaster </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font5"> is Christ Jesus, who will administer retributive justice. For centuries the enemy has proceeded in an arrogant manner, reproaching Jehovah’s name and inflicting cruel punishment upon God’s people. The payday is at hand, and the foot of the enemy shall slip and slide, because the due time has come. There will be no delay, but, as the foregoing text says, what is coming upon the enemy will come in a hurry. It is the day of calamity upon those who reproach God’s name. Religious leaders are the ones who have brought the greatest reproach upon Jehovah’s name. They have organized and operate a system of racketeering, and in order to deceive the unsuspecting people they have labeled their hypocritical organization “the Christian religion” and have fraudulently induced the people to believe that religion and “Christianity” are one and the same thing. For centuries the Roman Catholic Hierarchy of Authority have with their mouths claimed to trust in the shed blood of Christ Jesus as the purchase price of humankind, and yet they have pursued a course in direct opposition to the spirit of Christ. They have used the name of Christ for political and commercial purposes, and they have trodden under foot the name of the Son of Jehovah God, and have counted his sacrificial blood an unholy thing. They have also persecuted the servants of God who have faithfully proclaimed the truth to the people. In their wickedness they have reached the climax, and the time for Jehovah to duly pay them off has come. The apostle Paul, who was rescued from the snare of religion and made an apostle of Jesus Christ thereafter, under the direction of God’s spirit, wrote of the enemy and of their end. He quotes the words of Jehovah uttered by Moses in the foregoing text and applies the same to these last days: “He that despised Moses’ law died without mercy under two or three witnesses : of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace? For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.” (Heb. 10:28-30) Those who truly trust in Jehovah and Christ, and who believe and follow his Word, now see that the time for Jehovah to take action has come, and, seeing this, they greatly rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> In the preceding issues of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> consideration has been given to the prophecy of Joel wherein Jehovah foretold of the wicked action of the religionists against the faithful servants of God. Then Jehovah speaks of and concerning his faithful servants who have been woefully ill-treated by the religionists and tells what he is going to do for them. “Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompence upon your own head.” (Joel 3:7) These are words of assurance to Jehovah’s people that he will deliver them from the bondage of oppression and persecution. In A.D. 1919 Jehovah began to bring his faithful servants out of bondage. He caused them to wake up to their privileges and to see and appreciate the commission God gives to his faithful covenant people. Since then God has continued to reveal to his faithful servants his own great organization and how it is opposed by the wicked organization of Satan, and now God makes it clearly to appear that the religious leaders are the chief instruments of the Devil used to reproach his name and to afflict his people. This the Lord has done since he brought his remnant to the temple. Note this, that God has now raised his people “out of the place whither ye [the religionists] have sold them”, and he now causes his servants to announce to the enemy his words, to wit: “I . . . will return your recompence upon your own head.” The remnant and their “companions” now have the privilege and obligation of declaring God's determination to take action against the enemy, as stated in the Scriptures, to wit: “He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity; he that killeth</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.” (Rev. 13:10) &quot;Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works; in the cup which she hath filled, fill to her double.”— Rev. 18:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’ Because Armageddon is near, the time to “pay off” will take place and he sends the true followers of Christ Jesus throughout the land to declare his judgment in advance of its execution. This proclamation gives due notice to the enemy and enables the people of good will to flee from the enemy’s organization before God’s judgment is executed against the wicked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">* Further addressing his words of warning and condemnation to the religionists Jehovah says: “And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off; for the Lord hath spoken it.” (Joel 3:8) The “sons” and the “daughters” of the religionists are those who have been taught to call their leaders “father”, “reverend,” and “bishop”, and such children of the religionists have been led by their so-called “fathers” into the Devil’s snare, and now all such as remain there are the seed of the Serpent. Such “sons” and “daughters” the religious leaders hold as vitally essential to themselves for their carrying out of their wicked purposes. The “fathers” or leaders depend upon such sons and daughters to do deeds of wickedness, and their daughters in particular go about to collect the money from the gullible people to finance their organization; all of which they regard as necessary for maintaining themselves and their organization. Like the chief billy-goat, the priest leads the deluded and fanatical sons and daughters into a place of a peaceable assembly of others and there incites and induces and causes such sons and daughters to commit deeds of violence, and in those wicked deeds the leaders find satisfaction and self-glory. Jehovah, through his prophet, speaks of the day when Christ Jesus comes to execute vengeance in behalf of the Most High upon the religionists, the leaders and their dupes, and by that prophet says: “Also, thou son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters?” (Ezek. 24:25) It is then that God will take away from these self-exalted religious leaders their strength and the joy of their glory and the desire of their eyes.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Now Jehovah says to those oppressors who defame his holy name: “I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah.” This Jehovah does by delivering over to his King, “the Lion of the tribe of Juda,” all the nations of the earth, which nations he is now gathering to the place of battle. To Christ, the Executioner and King, Jehovah says: “Ask of me, and I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”—Ps. 2:8,9, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Jehovah then warns the rulers of his purpose to destroy them, and this notice he gives in advance in these words: “Now therefore be wise, 0 ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve Jehovah with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, for his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all they that take refuge in him.” (Ps. 2:10-12, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font5"> With extreme presumptuousness the head of the Hierarchy sets himself up as the one to receive the kisses of others, and thus he commits the presumptuous sin of assuming to be the One whom Almighty God directs the others to serve and obey. Not only is that an insult to the Lord, but it is a presumptuous sin, which is not forgivable.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> The pope then goes farther than the Lord himself and invites these deluded subjects to kiss his toe. Jesus Christ, the great Redeemer, became the inheritor and owner of the human race by right of purchase, paying his lifeblood therefor. All the nations of the earth are under his possession and control to do with them according to the will of God. It is the will of Jehovah God, expressed in his Word, that all who take their place on the side of Christ Jesus, and who joyfully accept him as their Lord, Redeemer and King and faithfully serve him, such Christ Jesus redeems and delivers. But not so with the rebellious oppressors of Jehovah’s faithful people. Those who commit such presumptuous sins, as aforementioned, and who by their conduct count the blood of Christ a common thing, making commerce of the same, and all who follow their lead in opposition to the Theocracy the Lord declares he will destroy. For many centuries God has suffered the enemy to pursue the course of wickedness without hindrance, but now the due time has come for the pay-off. “What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction; and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory.”—Rom. 9: 22, 23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> The “children of Judah” mentioned by the prophet Joel are all those who praise Jehovah, particularly the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, Christ Jesus, and including all of his faithful followers. Such continuously serve and praise the Most High. Such faithful ones obey God and refuse to obey man and are diligent to avoid the snare of religion. The faithful followers of Christ Jesus go forth to the people with the message of Jehovah, and by delivering that message they in effect “sell” the modern-day Tyre, Zidon and Philistia, that is to say, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allies of other religions. That message of truth operates to “sell” the religionists over to others who will enslave, oppress and exploit the religionists. This Jehovah’s witnesses and companions do by drawing to the attention of the people the truth of God’s Word, which shows that religion is the product and instrument of the Devil and that at the beginning of Armageddon Jehovah will deliver religion and the practitioners thereof over to their former allies, the radical ruling element, to be destroyed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>9</sup> And what is the sale price to the faithful servants of Jehovah? And what do they get out of the transaction? It is this: All the benefit that comes out of exposing religion, which has been used to defame the name of Jehovah God. The faithful thus serving Jehovah have part in the vindication of his name, and that is a great pay to them. Tyre was used as a type of such wicked religionists, and concerning her and the antitype, the religious leaders, the Hierarchy and willing allies, it is written: “And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the Lord; it shall not be treasured nor laid up, for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the Lord, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.” (Isa. 23:18) The pay that Jehovah’s faithful ones receive out of the transaction is the joy of doing Jehovah’s will and having a part in the vindication of his name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> Further Jehovah says of the sons and daughters of the religious leaders that “they shall sell them to the Sabeans”. According to another rendering of the text, they will sell them “to the men of Sheba” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(R.V.) </span><span class="font5">(1 Chron. 1: 9, 22, 32); that is to say, to the descendants of Cush, the son of Ham (Gen. 10: 6, 7); also to the descendants of Shem. (Gen. 10:21,28; Gen. 25:3) Selling them is doubtless to a mixed crowd of deluded ones. In early times those people of the type were raiders engaged in a destructive work. (Job 1:15) They were of the land of Sheba. They were also traders in different kinds of merchandise. (1 Ki. 10:1, 2,10) According to Joel’s prophecy they must have been engaged in the slave traffic. They were a cruel, heartless, wicked people, and they well picture, therefore, that extremely selfish part of humanity that have commercial or business relationships with the big religionists, such as Sheba had with Tyre, and that later turn against the religionists for the purpose of making gain out of the misfortune of those religionists. This is clearly corroborated by what came to pass upon those who marched against King Jehoshaphat. (2 Chron. 20:22,23) The dictators now permit the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to work with them, and all together they engage in robbing the Jews, who have been prosperous in commercial things and otherwise in obtaining money and property. When that radical and deluded element have finished with exploiting and robbing the Jews, it appears, then they will give their attention to the big religionists. It is said that Vatican City has stored up more gold and other riches than any other nation or organization. It may be expected that the various deluded radical elements will swoop down on the Vatican and Hierarchy after they have finished the Jews.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> The land of Sheba was a country far off from Jerusalem, being many miles to the south. (Matt. 12:42) As the prophecy says: “They shall sell them . . . to a people far off.” Therefore the religious leaders will be removed afar from the domain in which they have carried on their commercial, religious activities and will be taken so far away they will never get back. Their organization will be broken up and destroyed because, as the Scriptures declare, the rulers, meaning the radical element, will burn her with fire, and the Lord will put it into the minds of such to do so. (Rev. 17:16-18) Furthermore, and to make certain what will come to pass, the prophecy of Joel says: “For the Lord hath spoken it.” It is therefore certain that all such will come to pass, because God has said, “I have purposed it, I will also do it.”—Isa. 46:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> In due time Jehovah’s Messenger, Christ Jesus, appears at the temple of Jehovah. He tests the consecrated and then gathers into the temple the approved ones. Thereafter the approved must offer unto Jehovah “an offering in righteousness”; hence they are sent forth to proclaim his Word and his praises, doing service to Jehovah and Christ Jesus. (Mal. 3:3; Heb. 13:15) These faithful ones God favors by revealing to them the meaning of his prophecies, and they are sent forth by the Lord with this command: “Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles [nations (R.V.)]; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up.”—Joel 3:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> How wide or great shall be the proclamation mentioned in this command? It must have the same extent as Jesus commanded concerning this gospel of the kingdom, which must be proclaimed to all the world for a witness. (Matt. 24:14) That means the proclamation is to all outside of God’s “holy nation”, who compose the kingdom class. (1 Pet. 2:9,10) This message from Jehovah attracts the attention of those people of good will toward God, and hence the “great multitude” are informed of their privileges and they come from all nations to serve Jehovah and his King. At Joel 3: 2 God says: “I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat.” In obedience to his command the proclamation is given by his witnesses, and thus they have a part in doing God’s work toward the gathering of the nations.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> Furthermore Jehovah’s witnesses are commanded to proclaim the words “Prepare war”. This message does not mean to make preparation for another world war amongst the nations, but it means that the opponents of the Theocracy are to ally themselves and join themselves together in a world-wide confederacy to oppose Jehovah’s King and kingdom. It is the Theocracy that Jehovah’s witnesses announce and proclaim. It is the proclamation to the enemy to prepare for the battle against Jehovah. The Hierarchy and allied religionists are called upon to justify the action they have taken over a course of years, and particularly that now being taken against Jehovah’s faithful servants. The marginal reading of this part of the text is, “Sanctify war”; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font5"> “hallow a war.” Such is what the Hierarchy and allies are now doing. Religionists declare it to be a “holy war’’, “a war for Christian religion.” It is called a “Christian Front” movement, which makes war against those who support Jehovah God and his King and kingdom. Only the religious element could “sanctify” such a war. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy take the lead in declaring such to be a holy war. That religious organization puts forward Jesuits to howl against Jehovah’s witnesses, one of whom recently, by radio, broadcast words to this effect: If the American people would stand up on their hind legs, they could destroy Jehovah’s witnesses in a very short time.’ That same Jesuit priest, who bears the label of “father” and who advertises himself as a man of great ambition, is fully supported by the pope and other high officials of the Hierarchy. He is used to induce the poor deluded ones to stir up strife and attempt to break up all peaceable assemblies of those who do not concur with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. The proclamation of God’s message of truth is seized upon by them as an excuse for the Jesuits and other religionists to make war upon Jehovah’s witnesses in particular. In doing this they hesitate not to lie to the greatest extent in order to put over their wicked designs. The Hierarchy and other religionists are clearly shown to be the ones mentioned in the prophecy that “sanctify war”; and which was foreshadowed by Jehovah’s challenge to Tyre, Edom, Mount Seir, Philistia and the Babylonians to come on and make war.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> In the work of proclaiming the day of vengeance of our God, Jehovah’s witnesses, who are Christians, are acting strictly in obedience to Jehovah’s commandments. They are commissioned thus to do, and must perform that commission. (Isa. 61:2) They must proclaim publicly and within the hearing of all as commanded: “Wake up stir up (R.F.); rouse </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)')</span><span class="font5"> the mighty men.” Who are the “mighty men” mentioned in the prophecy? Both the Scriptures and the physical facts show they are those of the “Hierarchy of Authority”, who exalt themselves and who are exalted by conscienceless politicians and fanatical radicals. They are the ones upon whom great honor is bestowed and who are held up as examples. Therefore the prophecy is directed to such mighty men, commanding them, in substance, to wit: Rouse yourselves and go at it, Hierarchy. You have been exalting yourselves for centuries and boasting as to what you are going to do; and nowmake good your boast. Raise the issue against the witnesses of the Almighty God. You have organized your “Catholic Action” as a body politic to conquer and control the world, defame the name of Almighty God, and oppose his Idngdom; now go right on and put pressure on all public officials of this world, that is, political, judicial, legislative, police, executive, and all others who hear and exalt you and who join you in oppression and in opposition to the Theocratic government. Do this, and move into action against the witnesses of the Almighty God. Raise up your giant champion, that is to say, the modern-day Goliath, the corporate, dictatorial or totalitarian state. Cement together your arbitrary rulers. Organize your secret police and use them to spy on others, and punish all who may have in possession the Word of God or any explanation thereof. Cause your “yes men” in the legislative bodies to enact laws compelling flag-waving and saluting and the hailing of men, and also enact all other manner of statutes inflicting punishment upon those who attempt to exercise freedom of speech and freedom of worship. Plant your religious hirelings in the high official places of the present world powers and encourage them, particularly the judicial officers, to sell their judicial decisions for money, and at the same time to wrongfully inflict punishment upon those who dare to tell the truth of God’s Word. Raise your false cry against Jehovah’s witnesses, and denounce them as “Communists” or “reds”, and thus put the label upon everyone who does not favor your religious racket. Stir up the secular press and the radio owners and induce them to join with you in making false reports and publications to the people in the hope of strengthening your wicked position. You have for long influenced the people against God and his kingdom, while you have falsely claimed the right to rule the world in the place and stead of Christ. Now go to it, you big men; get together and see what you can do. You have been longing for a day to exert your power; you have been anxious for trouble or an excuse to fight, and now you shall be accommodated.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> Furthermore the Lord says to his opponents: “Let all the men of war draw near; let them come up.” The religious leaders, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, think to frighten, browbeat, coerce and compel all others to obey and bow to their dictates, and hence the Lord says to them: 'Come on and exhibit yourselves against the witnesses of Jehovah, who proclaim his truth. Do your utmost to stop them, if you will. Boycott the owners and operators of radio stations and compel them to refuse to broadcast anything that might shock your religious susceptibilities and expose your racket. Use the newspapers to proclaim lies against Jehovah’s servants, and employ men within your power to compel all other publications to support your religiouspolitical scheme to rule contrary to God’s will. After the judicial men of your organization commit grave offenses against the law of the land, such as selling justice or judicial decisions for money, cause the publishers of the press that are subsidized by your money to remain silent against such violators of the law. And let your mighty men continue to devise ways and means to hinder the proclamation of the message of God's kingdom, and in this do your very worst. This is your last show.’</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>17</sup> For many years the religious leaders, by means of their propaganda campaigns, have claimed that they would convert the world to their religion. Such has been their way of peaceable means to accomplish the purpose and gain control of the world. Now the religionists are desperate and are ready to resort to and do resort to any means to accomplish their wrongful designs. Hence Jehovah, by his prophet, says to the mighty men that oppose the Theocracy: “Beat your plowshares into swords, and your prun-inghooks into spears; let the weak say, I am strong.” —Joel 3:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Now the time has arrived when these wicked ambitious religionists think to grab control of and rule the world; and in order that they might have the full length of their rope God says to them: ‘Go right on; turn your once peacetime schemes of making proselytes into militant weapons. You did not succeed in converting and gathering all nations into your religious-political camp; now employ all manner of force to get the people under your control. Your “Catholic Action” appears to serve you well; so go forward and openly announce your alliance with Fascists and Nazis to employ force to gain control of the governments of earth.’ The Lord taunts them by telling them to do their very worst.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Furthermore addressing that wicked crowd Jehovah says to them, in substance: ‘Your pruning hooks, which you have employed to dress your religious vines, have not fulfilled your expectations in causing all the people to join with you and become subject to your organization. Now try to oppress men, and hence beat your pruning hooks into spears, that is, instruments of violence, and use violence in your efforts to regiment and control the people. Become open warriors, and thus be better equipped to fight against Jehovah’s witnesses and against Jehovah’s message and therefore against the Theocracy.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> Compared with the host of Almighty God every nation and every organization is weak and amounts to nothing. (Isa. 40:15) But to tickle the ambition of religionists, and to taunt them and feed their vanity, Jehovah sends this message to them by his faithful witnesses: “Let the weak [one] say, I am strong.” And so the vain deluded ones think themselves very strong to fight against all who take their stand on the side of Jehovah. Compared with the small number of Jehovah’s visible witnesses on the earth, and who appear to be entirely defenseless, the religious leaders in particular, together with their fanatical deluded ones, think themselves to be very strong. Professional politicians co-operate with such religionists because they think that is the best course to take to insure further political support. The politicians say publicly, “What we need is more religion,” without having any understanding of what “religion” really means. The religionists say, “The politicians are with us, and we must crush those who call themselves ‘Jehovah’s witnesses’.” These “mighty men”, so called, think themselves to be very strong against Jehovah God. The Devil and his wicked angels inject that thought into their minds. In all the totalitarian states the united efforts of the enemy are against Jehovah’s witnesses. In the so-called “democracies” there is a growing sentiment of the radical and political element to consider themselves strong and that they should destroy everything not agreeing with them, and particularly the witnesses of the Most High. All of these embrace “the nations that forget God”, because they fail to consider that God is Almighty and that his witnesses are acting under God’s commandment and that Jehovah will defend those who love and serve him. Without full faith in Jehovah and his kingdom it would now be impossible for any man to withstand the vicious attack of the combined enemy. Jehovah is the God of comfort, and, that the hope of his people may be strong, he puts into the mouth of his faithful servants this prayer, to wit: “Arise, O Lord; let not man prevail; let the heathen be judged in thy sight. Put them in fear, O Lord; that the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah.”—Ps. 9:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> Some who profess to be consecrated to the Lord are weaker in faith than others, and because of little faith they for a time become fearful. For their aid and comfort Jehovah answers the foregoing prayer of his faithful ones and causes his prophet to say to those who need more faith: “I, even I, am be that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass.”—Isa. 51:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> It is only those who trust implicitly in and who diligently serve Jehovah that can now say, ‘I am “strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might”.’ (Eph. 6:10) Such are without fear and will have boldness in this day in proclaiming God’s message of truth as commanded. (1 John 4:17,18) Within the borders of Britain and America the major portion of the witness work is now carried forward by Jehovah’s witnesses. In the outlying countries, where the number of witnesses is small, the enemy has been bolder and more arrogant in opposing the work of the Most High. The vicious opposition of the enemy is now greatly increasing in America and in Great Britain, and such of itself indicates that Armageddon is near. It is now very apparent that the demons have taken possession of the minds of those who are against God and against his King. Satan knows his time is short, and hence he puts forth all his power to control those who know not Jehovah God. The recent disturbance at Madison Square Garden, New York, clearly demonstrated that the deluded opponents or radicals are under the complete control of Satan and his demons, the wicked angels. The demons are seizing control of the radical element in every part of the earth, and thus that wicked one, the Devil, moves his forces in rapid preparation for the final showdown. Hence Jehovah says to all nations: “Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen [nations], and gather yourselves together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O Lord.”—Joel 3:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> The first part of this verse is addressed to the nations, all of whom are against God, except God’s “holy nation”. The latter part of this verse is a prayer of Jehovah’s “faithful servant” class, the “holy nation”. To the enemy forces under the immediate command of Gog, who is the first in command of Satan’s forces, Jehovah now says, according to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Version:</span><span class="font5"> “Haste ye, and come, all ye nations round about.&quot; The time for the assembly and the beginning of the fight is short, and therefore action must be speeded up. Satan knows that his time is short, and he hastens to do the very thing that God commands to be done. (Rev. 12:12) The haste with which preparation is made for the battle is indicated by the prophet of God in these words: “The chariots [of war] shall rage in the streets [ways of the enemy organization], they shall justle one against another in the broad ways; they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings.”—Nahum 2:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>24</sup> Now “Catholic Action” is speeding up in every part of the earth. The political dictators, with whom the Hierarchy is allied, are making speedy movements to increase their own strength and to extend their power to the point of completely preventing freedom of speech, of press, and of assembly, and freedom of worship. So frenzied are those of the more radical and deluded type that they move not according to the laws of dictators even, but act without the least semblance of legal authority, in their endeavor to prevent freedom of assembly and freedom of speech. All the physical facts now coming to pass clearly show that “the great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of [Jehovah]”. And what shall follow? “The mighty man [the enemy] shall cry there bitterly.”— Zeph. 1:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>25</sup> It is Jehovah’s day of vindication, and not only is he ready for the fight, but he welcomes it and invites the enemy to line up, saying to them: “Come, all ye [nations], and gather yourselves together round about.” Get ready for the fight; you have been boasting what you are going to do; now do it! Jehovah’s time is here for the vindication of his name, and so he invites the enemy to advance; and this he does by causing his witnesses, the remnant and their companions, to go out amongst the people and fearlessly proclaim his judgments that are written. Those who truly trust Jehovah delight to obey this command, and they with boldness proclaim the Theocracy; and the effect upon the religionists is to plague them even as locusts plagued the people in Egypt, and this incites the vicious to resentment, and “Catholic Action” increases. Jehovah, in substance, says to the enemy: ‘Surround them completely. Encircle my faithful witnesses now on the earth, and do your worst to hem them in by your vicious and cruel laws. Take away all liberty that your national laws once guaranteed to the people.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> In 1914 there began a “war in heaven” and the Lord Jesus and his angels fought against Satan and his forces, and Satan and his wicked crowd were cast down to the vicinity of the earth. (Rev. 12:7-9) Now the scene of final conflict is in the earth, and it appears that the following words of the foregoing prophecy of Joel are a prayer of the faithful to Jehovah : “Thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O Lord.” (Joel 3:11) In support of this, it is written in another part of God’s prophecy: “I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my highness. The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together; the Lord of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.”— Isa. 13: 3,4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>27</sup> The end of Satan and his horde of wicked ones is at hand, and that includes both the visible and the invisible part of his organization, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, that now vainly attempts to ride on the top of every nation. Therefore Jehovah says to them, and he commands his witnesses to continue to repeat his declaration, to wit: “Let the heathen be wakened [Let the nations bestir themselves (B.F.)], and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about.”—Joel 3:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> Therefore Jehovah’s witnesses, in obedience to God’s command, must proclaim and do proclaim the message, to Wit: “For it is the day of the Lord’s vengeance, and the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion.” (Isa. 34: 8) The faithful servants of God will now have in mind their commission and will perform the same by declaring the day of the vengeance of our God. (Isa. 61:2) For centuries Jehovah has permitted the enemy to operate without let or hindrance, but now he will settle the account with the enemy for all time. Therefore Jehovah maneuvers the enemy into position and stirs them up and causes his faithful witnesses to have part in this work by declaring the day of his vengeance against all wickedness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>29</sup> To all the nations that have allied themselves with the Devil Jehovah now says: “Come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat”; that is to say, the place of judgment and battle. Jehovah maneuvers the enemy right to that place or condition. He not only selects the battlefield, but draws out the enemy and all the people who support the leaders therein and compels them to show on whose side they are lined up. He forces them to show themselves to be against the Theocracy. The division is now rapidly taking place, and the people of the nations are dividing themselves into the two classes, one designated “the goats”; and the other, who are of good will toward God, are known as the “other sheep” of the Lord. It is a thrilling time, and the sound of the marching forces in preparation for battle thrills the heart of every one who loves righteousness and hates iniquity. Long have God’s people waited for this time, and they rejoice that it is here, because they know the Righteous One, the Mighty God, and his King shall gain complete victory. Jehovah leaves no excuse for the enemy to ever say they had not sufficient notice of his purpose against them. The host of Satan gathers from all parts of the earth against the Lord. That wicked horde is under the immediate command of Gog, the first in command under Satan. To that wicked crowd the Lord addresses his speech, to wit: “Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I am against thee, 0 Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal; and I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts of armour, even a great company, with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords.”—Ezek. 38: 3, 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> In 1919 Jehovah brought back his faithful people from the power of the enemy’s restraint, and his promise to them is that thereafter they shall dwell safely under his protection and care. (Ezek. 38:8) Having given his word to protect his own now, his remnant know that the enemy “shall not prevail against thee”.—Jer. 1:19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>81</sup> The words of Jesus addressed to his faithful servants show the enemy Satan gathering the nations to the battle of the great day of God Almighty. (Rev. 16:13-16) The faithful on earth now see the fulfillment of this prophecy of Revelation. At the “valley of Jehoshaphat”, or final judgment place, Jehovah causes them to assemble, and says: “For there will I sit to judge all the nations round about.” (R.F.) No part of Satan’s organization will be omitted from that assembly for judgment and execution. As the mighty Judge and Commander-in-Chief of all the host of righteousness Jehovah sits there to command and direct the execution of his judgment, which execution is done by Christ Jesus, his Executive Officer and Vindicator. That will be no kind of trial, such as is held in earthly courts. There will be no briefs filed and no arguments heard. It will be the time of execution. God has given Christ Jesus the “authority to execute judgment”. (John 5:27) The Lord Jesus Christ will there be pitted against the forces of Satan, and Jehovah sits, as it were, to umpire the fight and make known the result, and thereafter every mouth shall be for ever stopped that utters opposition to Almighty God. Righteousness shall triumph. This full assurance now gives great joy to those on the side of the Theocratic government and thrills their hearts with unspeakable courage and gladness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>82</sup> At this point of the prophecy it appears that Jehovah addresses his beloved Son, who is always faithfully obedient in carrying out the will of his Father. For many centuries Christ Jesus has waited for this hour, that he might vindicate his Father’s name, and which will constitute his fullness of joy. It is a time of great joy to his heart when he hears Jehovah say to him, and to his heavenly host acting under the command of Christ, the great Field Marshal: “Put ye in the sickle; for the harvest [of the grape-vine of Satan] is ripe; come, get you down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is great.” (Joel 3:13) Now the time has arrived when the knife must be thrust into Satan’s vineyard. “And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.”—Rev. 14:17,18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>88</sup> The purpose of thrusting in the sickle is to cut Satan’s vine loose from its moorings, which are deep in the earth. The vine is to be cast into God’s winepress and there trodden and destroyed. In connection with the putting in of the sickle is also included the gathering of the nations to the place of final conflict, and in this part of the work Jehovah’s witnesses have some part by declaring the purpose of Jehovah. According to another translation this part of the text reads: “Thrust ye in the vintage knife, for grown ripe is the vintage.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font5"> Surely that means that Satan’s organization, and particularly “Christendom”, which forms the chief part of the earthly organization of the enemy, is now ripe and ready for destruction.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>84</sup> Further Jehovah says to Christ, his King and Executioner: “Come, get you down [come, tread ye </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(R.V.); </span><span class="font5">go in, tread down </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)].”</span><span class="font5"> “The wine-press is full, the vats overflow.” (A.R.P.) </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font5"> In common usage the description is this: The earth is full of wickedness and violence, and the time for completely wiping it out is at hand. When the battle of Armageddon begins, the winepress or vats will be full, because the dividing of the people will then be completed and the “goats” will be on the left hand and those of good will, the “other sheep”, on the right hand of Christ Jesus, the Judge. Everything will be ready for the clash of power. That &quot;wine-press” will be a tremendous one, with capacity to hold all the nations that are against Jehovah God. (Rev. 14:19,20) The fruits of the enemy organization are now ripe. Those fruits of wickedness are ready for gathering. They are ripening or culminating in ever-increasing malicious slander, libel and assaults upon Jehovah’s servants. The Hierarchy have directed these assaults and declare the same to be a “holy war”, and hence they have ‘sanctified’ that war, declaring their determination to crush the truth, to the end that the Hierarchy may satisfy their vaulting ambition. Concerning this Jehovah, by his prophet, says: “For their wickedness is great.” Of necessity this refers to the “last days” or “perilous times”. (2 Tim. 3:1) It is the time when religionists have reached the superlative degree of hypocrisy, demonstrating clearly to all sane persons that such religionists, who claim to serve God but are hypocrites, ‘have a form of godliness, but deny the power thereof.’ (2 Tim. 3:5) It is the final fulfillment of the prophecy quoted by the Lord Jesus and directed to the same class of religionists, when he said: “Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.”—Matt. 15: 7-9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>35</sup> It is the time when religion has completely headed up and gone to seed. Their acts of wickedness Jehovah particularly refers to in Joel 3: 2-6, which wickedness religionists have done and committed against the faithful servants of Almighty God. By their cruel and wicked deeds committed the religionists have challenged Jehovah and Christ Jesus to prevent them from carrying on behind their breastwork of lies: “Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us; for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves.” (Isa. 28:15) Those hypocritical religious leaders have desperately tried and continue to try to destroy the temple company of the Lord, and Jehovah declares that he will destroy the hypocrites.— 1 Cor. 3:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> Surely Almighty God Jehovah has caused his sacred record, the Bible, to be written in such manner and set forth in such order that it can be understood and appreciated only by those who love him and who therefore desire to be guided in the right way. (Ps. 25:9) Every part of his Word is harmonious. This is to be expected, and now we know it is true. Some parts of his prophecy were written centuries ago by his faithful servants, the prophets. Long years thereafter other parts of his prophecy were delivered by Christ Jesus, the great Prophet, and caused to be recorded by his faithful servant John. (Revelation 1:1, 2) By his prophet Joel Jehovah declares his command to Christ Jesus, his glorious Vindicator, to march forward to the battle of Armageddon. At The Revelation is recorded the act of Christ Jesus in joyful and full obedience to the command of his Father. A great thrill that will be for every creature that is privileged to see the forward march of the mighty Vindicator, which John describes in these words, to wit: “And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood; and his name is called The Word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.” “And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.”—Rev. 19:11-14,16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>31</sup> It is the “time of war”! It is to be the final war. All the hosts of heaven will with the most intense interest behold it. The faithful on the earth will discern it and have full assurance in advance of what shall be the result. The zero hour has struck, and the Mighty Warrior, leading his invincible host, is marching to the attack. The deluge was the climax of the first world of wickedness and violence, and that foreshadowed the climax of the “present world&quot; of wickedness and violence. Let those who love Jehovah and his Kingdom now note the onward march of the heavenly host and with eagerness await the result as foretold in the prophecies.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(To be continued)</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark9"></a>SIXTH TRUMPET</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(( A </span><span class="font3">And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is  before God, saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates/’—Rev. 9:13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The ancient city of Babylon was the greatest city ever built upon the river Euphrates. By the commerce carried on that river the city was supported and maintained. It was built on both sides of the river and had suspended gates that swung out over the river, and these furnished a means of military protection and defense. The commercial and political element ruled the city, but did so through the power and influence of the religionists. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font3"> is one of the names the Scriptures give to the Devil’s organization, and particularly when the religion of Satan is in the saddle and controls. “Organized Christianity,” so called, is a part of Satan’s organization, since he has gotten control thereof; and it is supported by the people, pictured by the great river Euphrates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In ancient Babylon the men of influence were the religionists and exercised power by and with the aid of the commercial and political allies. Today the clergy of so-called “organized Christianity” exercise their power of control by and through the commercial giants, who control Big Business, and by the dictators and politicians, who make and enforce the laws and carry on the governments. All the elements of Satan’s organization, and particularly the clergy part of it, oppose the message of truth concerning God’s kingdom and persecute those who proclaim it. They induce their allies, Big Business and the political element, to persecute God’s anointed witnesses on earth. Had it not been for their evil influence so exercised today there would be millions of people praising God and hailing Christ as earth’s rightful King, and doubtless the battle of Armageddon would be unnecessary. It is the evil influence of these rulers of Babylon that holds its prisoners in restraint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Note that at the sound of the “sixth angel” a voice is heard from among the four horns of the golden altar in God’s holy temple. It must therefore be a voice of one of Jehovah’s organization, to wit, Christ Jesus, the great Priest of the Most High, that gives that “voice”, because it comes from all parts of the altar, the place of sacrifice, and Christ is the one great sacrifice for all. The command given is: “Loose the four angels that are bound </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font3"> the great river Euphrates.” (A.Ii.P.) In this connection mark another prophecy from Jehovah (Isaiah 45:1,13): “Thus saith the-Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut. I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, saith the Lord of hosts.” By this prophecy Jehovah pictures Christ his beloved, the great antitypical Cyrus, acting as his chief officer, swinging back the two leaved gates of Babylon that the imprisoned ones may be loosed. In this work the Lord uses his angels invisible to men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The word “angels”, however, does not always apply to creatures having a spirit organism, but often means a commissioned messenger with a message from Jehovah God. Matthew 25:31 states that spirit creatures with spirit bodies accompany Christ Jesus as his servants when he comes and serve at God’s temple. At Revelation 9:14 Christ Jesus at the temple, as the great High Priest of Jehovah, is shown giving direction to the sixth angel that had the trumpet, saying: “Loose the four angels [that is, commissioned messengers] that are bound [ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Diaglott)</span><span class="font3"> who have been bound] at the great river Euphrates.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(A.Il.V.)</span><span class="font3"> The number “four” here used signifies the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses in the four quarters of the earth, in a strong working body, doing the service of Jesus Christ under commandment from Christ Jesus and Jehovah. The fact that the command is given to loose them shows that up to a time certain they have been bound. The “four angels” or commissioned messengers are all of Jehovah’s witnesses anointed and commissioned and commanded by him to bear the testimony of Jesus Christ to the nations of the earth. The language used clearly implies that these witnesses must first be loosed from restraint and then be prepared and equipped for the work assigned to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the World War period the “faithful servant” class were in prison or restraint by Satan’s organization. The release of the faithful remnant of Jehovah’s servants took place in March, 1919, and on the 27th day of March, 1919, efforts were begun to organize and carry forward the witness work concerning Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ. At that time there was no organization prepared for the work. It was then that God, according to the prophetic picture of Revelation 12:14, ‘took his woman into the wilderness,’ that is to say, took the people of his organization into the condition which he had prepared for them. This preparatory work progressed and reached a climax in July, 1927, at the international convention of Jehovah’s witnesses at Toronto, Ontario, when the proclamation was sent forth “To the Peoples of Christendom”, and supported by a public address, which proclamation and address were shortly thereafter issued in a publication under the title “Freedom for the People”, and millions of copies of which were distributed throughout “Christendom”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord sent his angel invisible to sound the. sixth trumpet, and at the same time the command is given to loose the bound ones. Such message by his angel must of necessity be a “woe” to Satan’s organization that rules the earth. (Rev. 8:13; 9:12) The Lord caused his people to assemble in general convention in Toronto, Canada, that July, 1927. The Lord had so arranged conditions that the broadcasting combine was put in a position that its radio facilities must be used to the glory of the Lord. Unwittingly Satan’s agents fell into the Lord’s trap, and this increased the torment for Satan’s organization. Before a visible audience of 15,000 people, and within the hearing of an unseen audience of millions by radio, an address entitled “Freedom for the People” was delivered at this Toronto assembly, and the resolution entitled “To the Peoples of Christendom” was read, and the visible and the invisible audience by vote adopted the resolution. Fifty-three radio stations were linked together, a record hookup for then, extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast, and these, together with shortwave broadcasting apparatus, heralded the truth through the United States and Canada and to the lands across the sea. The spirit and substance of that message was: “Loose those who are bound in Satan’s organization and let them go free.” The Lord sent his angel to direct this message, and caused it to be given, and used his witnesses on earth in connection therewith, and it was heard by millions; and then later more than fifty million printed copies were put in the hands of the people; which message follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“resolution</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“To the Peoples of ‘Christendom’:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The International Bible Students in general convention assembled send greetings:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“As Christians and witnesses to the name of Jehovah God we deem it our privilege and duty to call your attention to the following vital facts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“First: That God made of one blood all peoples and nations of men to dwell on the earth, and granted to all peoples equal rights. There is therefore no just cause or excuse for one nation to make war against another nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Second: That the foremost nations of the earth claim to be Christian nations and, taken collectively, they constitute ‘Christendom’ or ‘organized Christianity’, so called; that the men chiefly responsible for the claim that these are Christian nations are the clergymen of the various religious denominations who call themselves by the name of Christ but who in fact have denied him; that their purpose of claiming that these nations are Christian is to induce the peoples to believe that said nations, although military and cruel, are the representatives of God and his Christ on earth; that such claim is fraudulent and false and has turned the minds of millions of honest people away from the true God and from his Christ; that the invisible ruler of the nations of ‘Christendom’, or ‘organized Christianity’, so called, is Satan the Devil, who has fathered the scheme of forming ‘organized Christianity’ to deceive the people and to keep them in subjection to himself and his agencies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“That the masses of the peoples of the nations are entitled to self-government exercised by the people for the general welfare of all; but instead of enjoying such rights a small minority rules; that the money power of the world has been concentrated into the hands of a few men called high financiers, and these in turn have corrupted the men who make and execute the laws of the nations, and the faithless clergy have voluntarily joined forces with the high financiers and professional politicians and that said unholy alliance constitutes the governing powers that rule the peoples; that the masses of the peoples, acting under a misapprehension of the true facts, have borne up, carried, supported and maintained ‘organized Christianity’; and that without the support of the common people the unholy alliance constituting ‘organized Christianity’ could not long exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Third: That for centuries the privileges enjoyed by men have been wholly unequal and unfair. The multitudes have produced the wealth of the world, but have been unjustly deprived of the fruits of their labors. That the leaders of ‘Christendom’, instead of teaching the children of men the doctrines of Christ, whom they claim to follow, teach them to murder their fellow creatures; and that now the rulers are amalgamating the common people with the military, in order to make all the peoples a part of and subject to their great war machine; that by unjust laws the common people, contrary to their own wishes, have been compelled to go to war against each other, resulting in great sorrow and suffering, multitudes of broken hearts and millions of untimely graves; that ‘organized Christianity’ has turned a deaf ear to the petitions and entreaties of the people for relief, and now the cries of the oppressed people have entered into the ears of Jehovah God, and his time is at hand to give the peoples deliverance and freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Fourth: That Jehovah is the only true God, the Friend and Benefactor of the peoples. He has now set his beloved Son Christ Jesus upon his throne and bids all the peoples of earth to hear and obey him who is earth’s rightful King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Fifth: That the kings and rulers of the earth, to wit, those constituting the said unholy alliance, have been duly notified that God has set his King upon his throne and that his kingdom is at hand; but they refuse to understand or to take heed, and they walk on in darkness. Therefore God has decreed and declared that there shall come upon the world a time of tribulation such as never was known and that during that trouble ‘Christendom’, or ‘organized Christianity’, so called, and all of Satan’s organization shall be destroyed; and that Christ Jesus, the righteous King, will assume complete authority and control and will bless the peoples of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Sixth: That it must be now apparent to all thoughtful people that relief, comfort and blessings so much desired by them can never come from the unrighteous system of ‘Christendom’, or ‘organized Christianity’, and that there is no reason to give further support to that hypocritical and oppressive system. In this hour of perplexity Jehovah God bids the peoples to abandon and for ever forsake ‘Christendom’, or ‘organized Christianity’, and to turn completely away from it, because it is the Devil’s organization, and to give it no support whatsoever, and that the peoples give their heart’s devotion and allegiance wholly to Jehovah God and to his King and kingdom and receive full freedom and the blessings God has in store for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Seventh: For four thousand years the cherished desire of Jews has been God’s Messianic kingdom. For nineteen centuries that kingdom has been the hope of real Christians. It is now at hand. True to his promise God by and through the reign of Christ will lift the burdens of the peoples, free them from war, fraud and oppression, from sickness, suffering and death, and give to them a righteous government and the blessings of everlasting peace, prosperity, life and happiness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Returning now to Revelation 9: In response to the commandment to unloose those bound at the Euphrates river it is written: “And the four angels were loosed, that had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, that they should kill the third part of men.” (Verse 15, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font3"> That loosing, which began in A. D. 1919 and which reached a climax in the forward movement in 1927, was done by the Greater Cypis, Christ Jesus. He commanded that his angel, who held the sixth trumpet, should give the signal to go. Everything was prepared, and the onward march began with great zeal. (Ps. 146: 7; Isa. 45:1,13) It was then that Jehovah’s witnesses were turned loose upon “Christendom” to do the work which God has provided for them to do. That convention at Toronto had been announced in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> as “a service convention” ; which indeed it was. It was there that God’s people by the Resolution adopted introduced themselves to the people of “Christendom” as “witnesses to the name of Jehovah God”, marking them as the people whom God has taken out for his name. “The four angels,” that is to say, Jehovah’s anointed witnesses, scattered to the four corners of the earth, were now better prepared than they had previously been to carry the message of God and his kingdom to the people. That marked the beginning of a campaign calling upon the people to break away from the bondage of Satan’s organization and declare themselves for Jehovah and his kingdom.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark11"></a>OBEDIENCE INSTEAD OF RELIGION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’S sanctuary class must first learn obedience I before having a part in the vindication of his great </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font3"> name. God provides his covenant people with his Word and gives them an understanding thereof in due time, that they may be instructed, and then they must do his will. To those who are in the covenant with him he says: “Be thou instructed, 0 Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.” (Jer. 6:8) These words of Jeremiah apply to those now on earth who are in a covenant to do God’s will. The wise man is one who diligently seeks to know the will of God, as stated in His Word, and who then hastens to do that will. To merely hear with the ears what his Word says is not sufficient: “Thou seest that faith wrought with [Abraham’s] works, and by works was faith made perfect.” (Jas. 2:22, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.)</span><span class="font3"> This shows that those are in a state of delusion who take the letter of the Word and not the spirit of it, and who fail to do what God tells them. Mere formalism in service of the letter of the Word is displeasing to Jehovah because it is mockery, and, says Galatians 6:7, “God is not mocked.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Christ Jesus appeared for judgment in A.D. 1918 and to take the approved ones into the temple of God, the facts and the Scriptures show, there were two classes before him, one that indulged in formalism, such as the pious, sanctimonious in appearance, those who loved to engage in public prayer and fasting that they might appear good to others, as having developed themselves to such a state that they were fit and necessary for the kingdom of heaven; and another and different class, namely, the ones who are meek or teachable, faithful in the performance of what they learned to be the will of God, and doing that will with joy, never looking to their own powers or attainments. The first class mentioned is the disobedient, and the other mentioned, the obedient class. These two classes must be separated, that the approved ones may be prepared for the work in the temple and for the vindication of Jehovah’s name in connection with the battle of the great day. Those of both classes stand before the judgment seat, having sacrificed their right to live as human creatures. But now something more important has arisen. They must obey. “Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.” (1 Sam. 15:22, 23) The prophecy of Zechariah delivered in connection with the building of the temple at Jerusalem shows both the disobedient and the obedient class. The separation of the two classes takes place, and the obedient ones are prepared and received into the spiritual temple of God, and have a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The opening of the seventh chapter of Zechariah’s prophecy discloses certain men of the Israelites being sent from the city of Bethel to pray and make speech before the temple builders. This occurred more than two years before the temple was completed, which proves that these men were not sent to pray at the temple; and therefore the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version</span><span class="font3"> is a poor rendering of the text of verses one and two. The correct rendering (the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font3"> is: “And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of Jehovah came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chislev. Now they of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to entreat the favor of Jehovah.” In the Hebrew text, the expression “house of God” as found in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version</span><span class="font3"> is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bethel.</span><span class="font3"> The meaning of this text here is that these men were sent from the city of Bethel to Jerusalem. Those people had returned with the Jewish remnant from captivity in Babylon and now occupied Bethel. (Ezra 2:28; Neh. 7:32; 11:31) The two men Sharezer and Regem-melech were proceeding under names or titles of foreign derivation, although now living in the holy land, and this suggests that they were not entirely in line with Jehovah’s arrangement to carry forward his work. Those men therefore fitly represent that class of professed followers of Christ who heard the truth and who took part in the work, the “Elijah work” of God’s people, and who have made much ado about their being a part of the house of God, that is, “Bethel.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">About 1918 and thereafter certain companies of dreamers have been in evidence, claiming to be in “present truth” and in line for the kingdom. The two men coming from Bethel, as above named, showed by their course of action that they were “old-timers” who had not kept up to date with the Lord’s truth and service. Likewise the class they foreshadowed prove to be “old-timers” belonging to and holding to old forms set up by men, such as observing dates and months, times and seasons. (Gal. 4:10) They have not entirely broken away from Satan’s organization, but still think they should be subject to the political powers that rule the land, and they refuse to tell the truth about these as being a part of Satan’s organization lest they cause someone to turn away from what they call “the truth”. These come to “pacify the face of Jehovah” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font3"> ; and this suggests a class of persons who indulge chiefly in so-called “devotional exercise”, delighting to sing hymns and tell of their own virtues and of their devotion to some hero of faith, but they show no real zeal and devotion to the service of the Lord God as he has commanded. They even call the hypocritical clergy, who form a part of the Devil’s organization, “our Christian brethren.” Since they are not a part of God’s organization, probably this is not out of the way for them to call the hypocrites “Christian brethren”. It is no wonder they desire the soft pedal to be put on when Satan’s organization is mentioned. “Birds of a feather flock together.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Joshua the high priest and Zechariah and Haggai the prophets were at work at the temple when these men who appeared to be very devout came there to show themselves. Doubtless they wore long, well-greased beards and had a very solemn and sanctimonious air and spoke with great gravity and sanctimonious solemnity to the priests at the temple, and, while speaking, shed a few crocodile tears. Verse three says they came “to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the Lord of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years ?” When they were in Babylon they had sat down and wept, and ever since had been great sticklers for formalities, and they had continued to indulge in shedding tears, even when they had been favored by being brought back to their homeland. They did not appreciate God’s goodness, but thought they must continue to weep and to appear to be good men. For sixteen years they had seen the temple lie in waste and nothing being done, and yet they continued to shed great tears at regular intervals that others might say: ‘Behold these devout men.’ Had they been really sincere and devoted to God they would have risen up long before, ceased their weeping, bravely and fervently faced the enemy, and joyfully entered into the work of building the temple at God’s commandment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since 1916, which marked the death of a prominent servant of the Lord, it is even so with the class above mentioned, and particularly after 1918. There are those who were brought out of Babylon, or Satan’s organization, and given the truth that was published prior to that date, and because one man, their earthly leader, was taken away from them, they said: ‘There is no more truth, and we will sit together and talk about the past and weep over what we have lost.’ The Lord has very marvelously foreshadowed all these minute things that are now being enacted, and this he has done for the very purpose of aiding the faithful ones to discern between the hypocrites and the zealous servants of God in order that the faithful might be greatly strengthened and prepared to press forward in the battle of the great day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The men appearing at Jerusalem inquired of the priests and the prophets, asking if they should weep in the fifth and seventh months and separate themselves as they had been doing for many years. The seventh day of the fifth month was the day that Babylon had destroyed Jerusalem and the temple. (2 Ki. 25:8,9) They now saw faithful men rebuilding the temple; and not seeing these faithful men weeping, but working with joy, these pious hypocrites evidently thought to rebuke the builders in some measure by thus inquiring and at the same time showing themselves to be very, extremely good men. The Lord shows it was no longer proper to fast and to weep, but that the ‘fast of the fifth month shall be joy and gladness’.—Zech. 8:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple of Jehovah, and the gathering of the faithful together, it has been a time of joy; but those ‘dreamers’, the “old-timers” who hold to the traditions of men, continue to fast and weep, and verily they have their reward, which is their approval amongst themselves. (Matt. 6:16) The present-day weeping ones do not see that the Lord Jesus is at the temple. In fact, that is one great truth that they vehemently deny, and they use strong language against Jehovah’s witnesses because they declare that the Lord is at his holy temple. This shows that the temple does not exist for them, that they do not see the temple, and are not of it, and hence are not born of God’s organization Zion, and are not taught of him. (Isa. 54:13) If they had been gathered unto the Lord and anointed they would see the great and wonderful truths which the Lord now reveals to his faithful ones. They would cease all outward formalities of fasting and weeping. ‘All of the temple show forth the glory of the Lord,’ and ‘the joy of the Lord is their strength’.—Ps. 29:9; Neh. 8:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah then gave his prophet a message to be delivered to these “old-time” weepers. Zechariah 7: 4 says: “Then came the word of the Lord of hosts unto me.” The giving of the word to Zechariah finds a parallel in the increased light that comes to the faithful after A.D. 1922. Note now with joy some of the wonderful things the Lord has brought to the temple class since that date. It has pleased the Lord to use </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> as a means of conveying his message to his covenant people; and in the year 1923 the Lord began to bring the message of joy to his hungry ones and they learned for the first time the meaning of the text, Nehemiah 8:10, “The joy of Jehovah is your strength.” (A.S.V.) Then in February of the same year the Lord revealed to his people that the cup of wine at the Memorial pictures good cheer resulting from the coming of the King and the kingdom. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> 1923, page 56) Then came for the first time the correct understanding of the parable of the talents and of the pounds, which also involve the joy of the Lord. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> 1923, pages 35,71) Then the parable of the virgins, showing that the oil in their vessels pictures joy and that the joy is in them because of God’s favor. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> 1923, page 296) Since then Jehovah has continued to cause his lightnings to flash upon the temple, and the temple class has continued to rejoice and put forth increased zeal and energy in his service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Knowing that the Lord Jesus is at the temple all of the temple rejoice. It would be entirely inappropriate for them to weep, and it would therefore be displeasing to the Lord. Hence the Lord commanded Zechariah to speak to these “old-time weepers” and say: “When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me?” (7:5) The divine message of advice and instruction was and is for all of God’s covenant people, that is to say, the ones holding responsible positions as well as all others, including the older Mordecai-Naomi class of the remnant, and the Esther and Ruth class that came to a knowledge of the truth later. This part of the prophecy shows that all of these had indulged to some measure in things which were no longer proper. They had mourned and wept in the past; but, now that the Lord is at the temple, they must no longer fast and weep, because it is a time of joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The very language of the fifth verse of the prophecy shows that fasting “in the fifth and seventh month” must have been a self-imposed fast in commemoration of the destruction of Jerusalem. (2 Ki. 25:25,26) There is no evidence that Jehovah by his prophets during the seventy years’ captivity enjoined these fasts upon the exiles. They had instituted these fasts at the instance of men. Likewise the many formalities that have been indulged in by the covenant people of God have been and are the institutions of men, and concerning such the words of the apostle are here very fitting, to wit: “If you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why, as living in the world, do you subject yourselves to ordinances: (‘Eat not,’ ‘taste not,’ ‘handle not’; all which things are consumed in the using;) according to the commandments and teachings of men? which ordinances, having a wordy show of wisdom in selfdevised worship and humility, by a non-indulgence of the body, not in any honor, are only for a gratification of the flesh.”—Col. 2: 20-23, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These modern dreamers and fasters were following the instructions of men, such as “character development”, which is pleasing to their own flesh and to other persons; and they think to do so to make themselves fit subjects for heaven, and that they may appear in the sight of others as approved ones. They abstain from things that are not forbidden by Jehovah, while at the same time they indulge in things that are forbidden by him. Their fasts, therefore, are not set by Jehovah. The unnatural life of self-affliction is not pleasing to God, but it pleases God for one to be active and positive in bearing the ‘fruits of his kingdom’ as he has commanded and to do so with zeal and joy. (Matt. 21:43) One who indulges in a “form of godliness’’, and has his heart affections on himself or on some other creature, could not be pleasing to God. Outward show of righteousness is moekcry, and to such the Lord is not blind.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DETERMINED TO CARRY OUT THE SUGGESTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In January, 1939, the Society suggested that more time might be occupied in the witness work, and suggested that sixty hours per month per publisher is not unreasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Although somewhat advanced in years, I determined that by the Lord’s grace I would carry out the suggestion. During the cold winter months I did not reach this quota. But when the weather got warm and the days longer I was able to put in more time in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Today, July 31, 1939, I am 81 years of age; and, in making out a report of my kingdom activities for the month of July, I find the following: Hours in service, 81; booklets placed, 308; bound books placed, 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As we approach the full establishment of the Kingdom, the Lord is placing on his table more nourishing food for his people. And now we have the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font3"> “a text-book for the Jonadabs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I look forward with joy to the “Divine Mandate” Testimony Period during the month of August, during which time we will place </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font3"> with the people of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is very gratifying to note the number of good will people we find while out in field service. Surely the Lord is gathering in the “great multitude”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The company of Paris, assembled for the first time in the new hall, sends you cordial greetings. We assure you of our profound sympathy for your courageous fight against the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and the whole Satanic organization. We thank you for your example and encouragement that you give us, so that we may be faithful to the Theocratic government of Jehovah. The publishers of Paris are engaged with boldness in the same fight, especially as we see the Catholic Hierarchy getting the upper hand in France. We are happy to know, by the grace of Jehovah, the outcome of the defamatory work of that cruel, diabolic organization. For this reason we arc determined to continue our activity for the King and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your sojourn in Paris at the time of the Paris convention, August, 1937, we still remember, and we now extend to you a new invitation to come to Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our best wishes are with you at the occasion of the New York convention, end of June, especially for the public lecture at this occasion. We rejoice in advance that we know the message and that the language is getting stronger, more precise and more actual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We are persuaded that our new and bigger hall in Paris will be an efficient means in the organization and the accomplishment of the “strange work” of Jehovah, and especially in the interest of the Jonadabs, as we now already have more than three-fourths Jonadabs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">NATIONAL DIRECTOR, AMERICAN JEWISH ALLIANCE, WRITES:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Mr. Joseph F. Rutherford. Dear Sir: I have noticed in your open letter to Mayor La Guardia published in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News,</span><span class="font3"> Vol. 1, No. 4, that you take the occasion to protest to the mayor of New York the attacks made by Coughlinites on peaceful Jewish citizens of the City of New York. Permit me to thank you heartily for the expression of sympathy on your part to our people and the words of sympathy in our behalf. It is indeed the sympathy of men like you that give us in these dark days that sustenance in faith in humanity and in the brotherhood of man. We are fully convinced that the good sense of the American people will reject the bigotry and intolerance preached by men like Coughlin and will sweep clean their influence in the American community. I extend a hand of warm thanks to you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">AT WETTINGEN (AARGAU), SWITZERLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Sunday, June 25, between 9 and 10 p.m., we heard Judge Rutherford’s lecture over shortwave 16:85 meters, in our own room, after our </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study. We could hear almost every word as distinctly as if we were personally in the Madison Square Garden. A brother wrote down parts of the talk in shorthand and afterwards translated it for us. At times the message came in thunderously. It must have been a powerful witness. But sometimes we could also hear a fairly loud howling and whistling in the background ; but it was drowned out by Judge Rutherford’s voice. Was that the Catholic Action? It was a wonderful sensation to be there in spirit, though, with exception of a few words, we could not understand the language. We also heard tremendous applause, and we could not help but also clap our hands. We are looking forward with rejoicing and great expectancy to receive this message in printed form.” (Dated June 26, 1939)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BUS DRIVER, ON DAY OFF, TAKEN FOR A RIDE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“An automobile drove up and the driver (he was alone) asked me whether I had any of Rutherford's books. He said his mother wanted some, and if I would get in the car he would take me to his mother’s house. As I thought he resembled a man whom I had witnessed to a short time before, I didn’t hesitate to get in the car. He immediately drove out of the territory I was working, so I asked him where his mother lived. He said: ‘Just forget about that. I’m just taking you in the car to inform you to cease working and quit peddling that “crap”. And that means all of you Jehovah’s witnesses here in town. The quicker you people quit this work, the better off it will be for all of you.’ While he had been saying this I had been sizing him up and noticed he had on no collar, but a ring around his neck indicated that he had worn a collar as if he might have been a priest. I said, ‘I think that you are a priest, and I believe I can identify you if I see you again.’ With these words he turned very red in the face. I-said: ‘You know what this work is all about and also what will happen to you for opposing it.’ Thereupon he slowed down at the curb and asked me where I lived. I told him about two blocks from there. He then said: ‘I’ll let you out here, but don’t go back into the territory.’ I immediately went back and worked for two more hours, but wasn’t bothered any more that day. He did not have any license plates on his car. My experience</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">IN THE PANAMA CANAL ZONE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Across the street was a Catholic ‘church’. My son and I, armed with ‘sling and stone’, tackled an imposing building with 116 rooms, three floors. Some were empty and others closed. We worked it in three evenings, using such discs as ‘Peace Messengers’, ‘A Cleansed World,’ and ‘Enemies’, placing 20 bound books and 16 booklets of both languages. In some homes the people endeared themselves to us from that day till now—just as sheep—after listening to the recordings. A lady coming home from work invited us to visit her on a day appointed. When we went, she was so glad to hear the message that she acted as though we were strangers from another planet. Another Spanish lady, a student of the Escuela Nacional and her young husband were discussing </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Purgatorio</span><span class="font3"> the night before, and the next day (Sunday) we were at her door with the very thing they were discussing. He said to her: ‘Didn’t I tell you that the priests are robbing you. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dios</span><span class="font3"> [God] sent this man to us to prove what we were talking about is true. He is an angel.’ She fondled and kissed him and patted him on the back and loaded her shelf with every Spanish book I had then. Since then we are real </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">amigos</span><span class="font3"> [friends].”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">AMONG GERMANS OF SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“While witnessing to a German Catholic I was advised that God could do nothing for the people, but our only hope was Hitler and the pope. I understand from real good authority that the swastika emblem is being worn by school children in this district. For further particulars write Dion Kopperud, Lannigan, Sask. Further, some of the Catholics have said: ‘Get out of the district; we don’t want to have to use a shotgun on you.’ Reply was: ‘Then the priest has told you to use a shotgun?’ To which no answer. ‘We are not afraid of the priest, nor his shotgun, nor are we afraid of his father, the Devil.’ There are honest Catholics who must get this message, and we are staying till the work is done. The party finally consented to hear the record and listened while both sides were played, admitting that it was true and asking the witness to call again. At a door a wife said: ‘My husband no want, get mad at you.’ Witness: ‘Where is your husband?’ ‘At the barn.’ ‘All right, I will talk with him.’ After a short talk he consented to hear both sides of the German record. Family listened intelligently. All he had was a dime and a three-cent stamp, but he took four German booklets and invited the witness to call on him again. The Haman class [Esther chapters 3-7] are surely getting their head into the halter. These people generally are kindly disposed, but awfully afraid of the priests.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE TALK OF THE SOUTH DAKOTA RURALS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I witnessed in rurals around Mitchell Tuesday and Wednesday and found farmers 25 miles out of the city talking about the information marches they had seen in Mitchell. They asked us if we had a part in this business. Information marches, especially Saturday afternoon and early evenings, certainly give a great witness to many people in these communities.”</span></p>
