<h4><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Victims of the Snare</span></h4>
<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font12">N THE preceding issue of this magazine the Scriptural proof was submitted that &quot;‘religion is a snare” set by the Devil to eateh fearful men. It is written in End’s Word: “The fear of man bringeth a snare ; but whoso putteth his trust in Jehovah shall be safe.” (Proverbs 29 : 25, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font12"> The Bible, the Word of God, long ago foretol^i the present time as ‘times of peril, days of evil’. (2 Timothy 3:1) Satan, knowing that his time is short before the final battle at Armageddon, has brought great woes upon the peoples of earth, and these woes have constantly increased since 1918, (Revelation 12:12) These are, the days of which Jesus prophetically spoke when Tie said; ‘Men’s hearts failing them for fear and for looking after the things coming upon the earth.’ (Luke 21 : 26) Dictatorial rule in many of the nations has put fear in the hearts of the people of every nation, and they are looking for some way to safeguard their interests. Satan has taken advantage of his own wickedness and, through his earthly agents, is greatly increasing the fear of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Economic conditions that have come in the past few years have brought great fear upon the commercial men of the world. They fear that they cannot hold the power over men which commerce has given them. More recently their fear has increased by reason of the activities of the radical element, which threaten to destroy commerce and profiteering in the land. That fear of men or what men might bring to pass has led the commercial men right into the snare of the Devil, and their woyds now fully admit that fact. For the first time</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Brooklyn, N. Y., Wednesday, October </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">4, 1939</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Number 521</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">in the history of America commercial men insist that only religion can save the nation from disaster. In August, 1939, the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York released to the public press their report, and the following is quoted from the public press, and the report, to wit: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;••</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“New York, Aug. 13- That religion should be an integral part of public education in the state’s schools is the first recommendation made by a special committee of the New York State Chamber of Commerce, appointed in February, 1938, to implire into the efficiency and economy of the educational system of the state. The committee warmed that if the nation does not uphold its religious foundation its whole structure will fail.”—Tin: Press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The report of the committee says: “At tills time the state and nation find themselves in different conditions and with different needs from those which our country has ever heretofore known, and our educational system must be adjusted to meet these present-day needs. This committee is convinced that the great lack in our homes and in our national life, is the lack of true, simple religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Tn these work-a-day, warring, strenuous times, we have been paying less and less attention to our religious convictions and feelings. Those convictions and feelings still exist, they are more important today than they ever were, and it is vital that in our education they be honored and promulgated rather than subordinated or excluded. If this nation does not maintain its religious foundation, its whole structure will fail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“When we say religious, we do not mean any particular church or sect. We do not want church differences mixed up in our schools; but we do want our scholars to appreciate and understand the importance of their following and making the most of the faith with which they are identified. We want them to know and to live by the basic rules of life which each will find in his own religion. Integrity, kindly human understanding and true morals</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">are found </span><span class="font12">in each, and those our scholars must </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">’’ (know </span><span class="font12">and follow all through their lives if they </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">would </span><span class="font12">build high characters and play the part </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font12">need them to play in the future of this nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“The United States cannot have or main</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">tain </span><span class="font12">a right system unless it is based on true religious principles, and, therefore, in spite </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">. of </span><span class="font12">the fact that some hesitate to include religion in our educational program, we place </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font12">first.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If that committee had advised the study of the Bible, and the faithful service of Jehovah God, and Christ Jesus, it would have done well. Contrary thereto the report completely ignores the Bible and no mention is made of Jehovah God or Christ Jesus. Religion alone </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font12">stressed as the savior of the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There are more than 200 religions practiced in America, and not one of those religions teaches or advocates God’s announced remedy for the ill effects upon the peoples of earth. Many of the religions are under the direct control of demons and honor the Devil himself openly. In fact, all religion is based upon the worship of demons or things pertaining to demons. In the face of the plain statement to this effect in the Bible, the aforesaid committee reports that religion is the hope of the nation. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy religious institution takes the lead in religious matters, and yet that institution has been diligent to keep the people in ignorance of the Bible, and that institution also continuously persecutes those who teach the Bible to the people. The Hierarchy publishes the fact that it? principal doctrines are based upon the traditions of men and not upon the Scriptures. That institution has been in operation for more than 1500 years and it has completely failed to instill in the people integrity and morality; and this every honest and sincere person knows. Adolf Hitler is a Catholic and </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">practitioner of religion, and his regime for several years has had the support of the Roman Catholic religious institution. It is well known that Hitler constantly consults the wicked spirits, and certainly Hitler and his religion are not teaching and cannot teach the youth morality, integrity, or even common decency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Religion has always been the institution of persecution and crime. Jesus Christ was crucified by religionists, and all His disciples suffered persecution at the hands of religion</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">ists, and His true followers today likewise are persecuted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The early settlers of America fled Europe because of religious persecution and settled in America, where they might worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience. The men who founded the United States government embodied in the fundamental law the provision guaranteeing the freedom of worship. The Roman Catholic religious institution has always fought against that part of the American Constitution. When Christians assemble peaceably to teach the Bible, and to worship God in spirit-and in truth, the religionists of the Hierarchy make a desperate attempt to break up such a-meet-ing of Christians and to prevent the study and teaching of the Bible. That kind of religion could never instill in the minds of American youth integrity, morality or respect for the law. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The report of the aforesaid committee of the Chamber of Commerce discloses that the members of that committee are either ignorant of the Bible or purposely ignoring it, and for the Bible teachings they substitute religion. The Bible is the Word of Almighty God and is absolutely opposed to religion, assigning as the reason therefor that religion originated with the Devil. Christianity means to obey God’s command, as set forth in the Bible. The Bible contains the word of God, and concerning it the Christian, Christ Jesus, said: “Thy word is truth.” (John 17:17) It is by the Word of God that the right principles of honesty, integrity and morality can be taught. The Bible is the only safe guide for man: “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” (Psalm 119; 105) It was written and given to man that those who love righteousness might be guided in the right way and learn true morality, honesty, and integrity, and that they might worship Jehovah in spirit and in truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The clergymen, who are the religious leaders, have not taught the people to have proper respect for the Word of God. They have-substituted the teachings of men for that which is contained in the Bible, God’s Word. The Lord Jesus Christ instructs all His followers to pray to Jehovah God: “Thy kingdom come ; thy will be done, on earth as in heaven.’ (Matthew 6:10) There is no religious institution or organization in America that teaches the people that God’s kingdom is the only hope of the human race. The committee of the Chamber of Commerce now urges the people to choose any kind of religion and teach it, and ignores the Bible. The word of God, as set forth in the Bible, makes it clear that religion is a snare of Satan and his associated demons. (Deuteronomy 7:16) Jesus emphasizes the fact that religion is of the Devil. (Matthew 15:1-9 ; John 8 : 42-44) The apostle Paul likewise denounced religion. (Galatians 1:1-16; Acts 26:3-20) The apostle makes known how God rescued him from religion, the Devil’s snare. He told the Athenians, who were practicing religion, that they were in fact worshiping demons: “Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars’ Hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.” (Acts 17:22) Note other translations of this same text: ‘‘Men of Athens, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font12">perceive that you are in every respect remarkably religious.” </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Weymouth')</span><span class="font12"> “Paul, Standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said, Athenians, I perceive that in all things you are extremely devoted to tile worship of demons.” </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Emphatic Diaglott)</span><span class="font12"> “Ye men of Athens! in every way, how unusually reverent of the demons ye are, I perceive.”—</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Do the good people of America, who believe in honesty, integrity, and morality, desire to have their children taught religion, which is the worship of Satan and other demons, and which is against God and His kingdom by Christ Jesus ? Is the committee aforementioned wholly ignorant of the teachings of God’s Word,, or have they willingly ignored God’s Word to draw the people into the snare of the Devil ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">From the beginning of America this was considered a Christian nation. The Supreme Court, of the United States long ago so held. Now it appears that the clergymen, or religious leaders, have turned the people away from God and Christ, and have substituted religion entirely for the Scriptures. The clergymen, fearing that by preaching Christ and Him crucified they might not receive the honor which they desired, adopted religion instead of Christianity. They soon induced themselves to believe and led others to believe that religion and Christianity are the same thing; yet the Bible shows that religion is directly opposed to Christianity. The clergymen, desiring to increase their own power and influence and to enlarge their fields, solicited political and commercial men to join their institutions, and as an inducement they have made commercial men the chief ones in their flocks. .The commercial men were induced to embrace religion; and they feared to refuse </span><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>:</sup>  to support it, because it might militate against their interest to do so. The clergymen and the the principal of their flock, the political and com-mereial members, even as Gbd foretold through -His prophet, draw near to the Lord only by the words of their mouth, while their hearts are far removed from Him; and thus they are eaught in the snare of religion. (Isaiah 29:10-13) The love of money and the power that money would bring was an added inducement for the commercial men to embrace religion and to associate themselves with the clergymen. In this connection mark the words written in the Bible relating to such: “But they that will be rich fall into temptation, and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil; which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.”— </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font12">Timothy 6: 9,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It was an easy matter for men representing the commercial interests to be led into the religious snare. It is manifest that if they ever knew anything about the Word of God they have turned away from it, as the Scriptures further state concerning the charge, which the apostle gave to Timothy: “Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy.”—1 Timothy 6:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Mark this: that the report of the Chamber of Commerce committee aforesaid has completely ignored God and His Word. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Now in this hour of stress upon the world, wdien all men aside from Christians are filled with fear, the Chamber of Commerce by its committee urges upon the people that they teach in their schools any kind of religion. Thus it is seen that the Devil is leading the nation into his snare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Will the teaching of religion save the nation ? Far from it! There is one God Almighty, whose name is Jehovah. He is the Creator of heaven and earth, and He alone is the fountain of life. (Psalm 24:1; 36:9) He gives special warning to those who pretend to serve Him and who forget God and turn away from Him, and His warning is couched in these plain words: “The wicked shall be turned into ’ hell, and all the nations that forget God.’*</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(Psalm 9:17) If the advice of the Chamber of Commerce committee is followed the whole nation will be taught to forget God and His Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Let the people keep in mind that Jesus Christ emphasized the importance of God’s kingdom as the dtily hope of humankind. There is no other hope. The people must now choose between the instruction given in the Bible and the advice given by religionists. Instead of religion’s planting any hope in the minds of men, and making any provision for their salvation, exactly the contrary is the result-</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Jehovah God plainly directs the people to the only means of salvation and the only thing in which they can hope, and in this record He says: “Behold, my servant [Christ Jesus] whom I have chosen; my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased; 1 will put my spirit upon him, and he shall declare judgment to the nations. And in his name shall the nations hope.” —Matthew 12:18, 21, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span><span class="font12"> margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The report of the committee of the Chamber of Commerce discloses the fact that the members thereof are victims of the snare. They are blind to the Word of God and are following their blind leaders, the clergymen of the religious institutions; and concerning this the Lord Jesus, directing His advice to the multitude, said that they should avoid the blind clergymen; ‘for the blind lead the blind, and both shall fall into the ditch .’-Matthew 15:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The American people, as well as the people of other nations, must now make their choice between religion and the kingdom of God by Christ Jesus. Instead of following religion, which leads into the snare of the Devil, let the people devote themselves to Christianity, which means learning and obeying the Word of God and worshiping Almighty God in spirit and in truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">WHERE are the patriotic flag-wav-ers of the Catholic Press? Why not a few salvos for Hoover, Cahill and Murphy for ridding the bench of the greatest criminal and traitor of modern times? Martin T. Manton, Knight of St. Gregory the Great, of the Roman Catholic Church, was convicted in June, 1939, of accepting the sum of $183,000 for only six decisions handed down in the second highest court of the land, the United States Court of Appeals. There were a good many other cases which undoubtedly could have been used by the prosecutor, but six seemed enough to prove the crime. It was a difficult job to bring to justice such an arch-criminal, and, no doubt, had the investigators made any slips, Manton would have been on them like a tiger. But the work is accomplished; the courts of justice are cleansed of an influence more deadly than Communism. Now where are the professional patrioteers that are always lathering forth about little children who conscientiously refuse to salute a flag, and the self-constituted saviors who are advocating “Franco’s way” to save the country from the “Red Terror”? Speak up, Catholic Press, or forever after admit your hypocrisy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It certainly takes a lot to cause a distinguished Catholic to be excommunicated if he </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">6</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">divides his spoil with the Hierarchy. Martin T. Manton has not been either excommunicated or even publicly censured. The people are left to surmise that the Catholic Church finds nothing blamable in defrauding and betraying the United States Government. What is the reply to this from Rome’s American flag-wavers? (See “A Mighty Catholic in the ‘Pit’,” in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font12"> Nos. 519, 520, 521.)</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Recipe for Making a Bishop</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Details from Rochester, N. Y,, show that it takes two hours forty minutes of standing up and sitting down and all kinds of religious things like that to make a first-class, or A No. 1, bishop of the Roman Catholic church. The one that was made over was the “Most Reverend” Walter A. Foery. The ones that made him over were the “Most Reverend” Emmet Walsh and the “Most Reverend” Francis Keogh. They did a good job, which ' was helped along by the presence of four archbishops, 14 bishops, 500 monsignori and priests, a pack of dogs and two cats. The result, according to the dispatch, was that:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">He emerged at the end of a two hour and 40-mlnute ceremony as a spiritual descendant of the original apostles through the invocation of the Holy Ghost, the ministrations of his episcopal consecrators, and his own prayers and pledges.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">WITH Armageddon almost within reach it is inevitable that the totalitarian monstrosity should begin to make its appearance in America, and many are wondering if Coughlin is the peculiar combination of Catholicism, craftiness, conceit, inconsistency and inflammatory oratorical power necessary to put it over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One of the interesting features of the recent convention of Jehovah’s witnesses in New York city was the reading of the following letter to the conventioners. The letter, signed by Dr. Herbert M. Lauring, optometrist, of 707 West 171st St., New York, was addressed to Judge Rutherford, principal speaker at the convention, and was dated June 23, the opening day of the assembly. It said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It was with great interest that I read the posters in the subway announcing the mass-meeting in Madison. Square Garden on June 25 at which you are to speak on ‘‘Government and Peace”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">No doubt you are familiar with the series of articles on “The Catholic Church in Politics” by L, Lehmann, published a few mouths ago in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The New Republic,</span><span class="font12"> in which the author described the attempts of the Roman Church to deny religious liberty to Jehovah’s witnesses, the denomination of which you are the spiritual leader.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Let me say right now, that I am a Jew, and a firm believer in freedom of speech, religion, press, assembly and thought; therefore, when I read of the vile machinations of the priests to suppress your church, I became aroused to anger. I really am unfamiliar with your political and economic views, and am totally unaware of the nature of the remarks you will make in Madison Square Garden. I do not know whether you will be pro or antiadministration. However, you will have- an excellent opportunity at this great meeting to expose to the whole world the Catholic plot to undermine our democratic and representative form of government, and set up in this country a Papal-Fascist dictatorship to be ruled from Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The leader of this insidious movement is Father Charles E. Coughlin, who is at this moment disseminating a wild and bestial anti-Semitism, having had wide success among certain Catholics. In Germany Father Coughlin is now a great hero, and at the recent meeting of Fritz Kuhn’s GermanAmerican Bund in Madison. Square Garden, his name was cheered to the echo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If Father Coughlin were speaking only for himself, and not for his church, then it is quite apparent the priesthood should repudiate him from every Catholic pulpit in the nation. Yet what do we find? Certain official organs of the Catholic Church, like </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">OCTOBER 4, 1939</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">te'</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■C the Brooklyn </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Tablet,</span><span class="font12"> openly support him. </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Other </span><span class="font12">prominent Catholic churchmen covertly give aid <sub>? </sub>and comfort to him. The few scattered Catholics who have disavowed him have been like voices lost in the wilderness. When Cardinal Mundelein declared that Coughlin did not speak for his church, Father Coughlin in reply virtually told the Cardinal to go to blazes. Despite the fact that the Detroit priest is propagating a savage race-hatred, which will finally culminate in rivers of blood running through our streets, the priesthood, by its silence and concealed assistance, gives assent to his activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Of approximately 140 million people in the United States, 115 million are Protestants, 21 million Catholics, and 4 million Jews. The great Protestant majority and the Jews believe in a parliamentary representative form of government and the Bill of Rights. The Catholic Hierarchy desires an authoritarian state, such as the Doll fuss-Catholic dictatorship in Austria, prior to Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Although the Jews are the target of Catholic anti-Semitism at this moment, they cannot very well lead an anti-Catholic campaign because of their small numbers, and because the enemy would then howl that the Jews are attacking Christianity, The audacity of the Catholic Church in presuming to speak for all Christianity is something which should enrage all Protestants. It is therefore the duty of the Protestant Church, of which your denomination is a branch, to assume the leadership of a great movement to shed light upon Catholic intrigues to subvert our government, and to make itself the state religion of our country. Once you give the lead, the Jews will follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Again may I emphasize that at Madison Square Garden, on Sunday, you will have a wonderful opportunity to fire the opening gun in a battle to preserve our institutions. I assure you that my friends and I will be present to hear you speak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">' •</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Well Chosen Words ‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Dr. Lauring’s words, above set forth, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font12">well chosen, as those to whom it was read </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font12">mostly well aware, and as the readers of this magazine also well know. It is good to know that men of his intelligence are waking </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">up to </span><span class="font12">what is coming; for eome it surely will, Coughlin is a menace to America and to mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Coughlin has occasionally been </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">mentioned. </span><span class="font12">in these columns, but not at any considerable length, because heretofore the space could </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font12">used to better purpose, hjit there is a reason ' at this time for giving this man some of the publicity he craves. It should be said at the outset that, like every Catholic priest, Cough- .</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I' hn has beeri taught to disregard the Holy J $etiptures. Thus, in a sixteen-page lecture ? entitled “Following the Christ-child” there ■■ was not one Scripture citation. Holding the ' Scriptures themselves in light esteem, Coughlin and all other Roman Catholic priests hold in even less esteem those who place their sole reliance in the Word of God and not in the words of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It was thus a natural outlet for Coughlin’s energies that in 1927 he used his then considerable influence with radio station WJR, Detroit, to prevent, and he did prevent, the broadcasting at that time of Judge Rutherford’s address on “Freedom for the Peoples” over that station. That address, originating in Toronto, Canada, was taken for the largest number of radio stations assembled in a wire-connected chain ,up to that time, 53 stations. But for Coughlin.it would have been 54. He will be fully rewarded for that service when destroyed in Armageddon, but is entitled to some temporary compensation in advance. This is it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In 1937, ten years later, in a letter to a correspondent in Massachusetts, he referred to the message of God’s kingdom, issuing from the pen of Judge Rutherford, in the following language:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The literature which you enclosed is only a very small part of the vicious material being circulated by Judge Rutherford and his followers, who for years have been notorious for their opposition to the Catholic Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">. In the same letter he did his best to defend the doctrine of “Purgatory”, which anybody who has read the booklet </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font12"> (probably referred to in the foregoing) knows has not a leg to stand upon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">•</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hurts Coughlin’s Business</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The circulation of the truth on any Scriptural subject hurts Coughlin’s business, and that accounts for his hatred of Judge Rutherford and of Jehovah’s witnesses in general. He has a racket for enrolling, for the small sum of $1 each, the departed ones of Catholics, Protestants and Jews. If one is enrolled it is $1: if two, it is $2: if three, it is $3: if four, it is $4: if five, it is $5. It is making money just like that. What do the people get for their $1, $2, $3, $4 or $5? They get stung. That is the total return. - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The suggestion has been delicately advanced by some bf the priest’s crities that some of the hundreds of thousands of dollars flowing in to him should be used for direct relief of poverty. He does not seem to have thought of that. He is for Coughlin first, last and all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It would be'hard to find anywhere a more thoroughly selfish man than this so-called “Christian priest”. The way the Yiddish newspaper of New York put it as respects his followers and Jehovah’s witnesses in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Der Tog </span><span class="font12">(The Day) of June 27, 1939, is translated as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Give the Coughlinites liberty and they will know bow to appreciate it. They went to a convention of Christians, a group that is opposed to the pope, and caused a riot. At the meetings of Coughlinites no one is permitted to contradict by the use of a single word, but the Coughlinites themselves are not similarly particular concerning liberty of speech: they intruded Into the convention of another organization and started a riot. The followers of Hitler used exactly the same methods during their first years in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I have not yet heard him (Judge Rutherford) speak a single unkind word against Catholics, neither against those in this country nor in general. His lectures, therefore, truly come in the category of free speech. What is here involved are ideas, and freedom of speech is the basis of our democracy. You ought to see the list of persecutions which Jehovah’s witnesses are suffering in the various cities and towns of America. They are refused halls in which to hold their meetings, and, when they hold meetings, are assaulted; their children are expelled from schools; they have been tarred and feathered. This has been done by Catholics against the witnesses because they have denounced, not Catholics, nor even the pope, but the Papacy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Norman Thomas Inquires</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There is no use in inquiring of a gangster why he does what he does, but it is sometimes done, merely to get him on record, or to show that he dare not speak up like a man and tel! what his. motives are. Norman Thomas wrote Coughlin as lately as June 23, 1939, calling his attention to the fact that Coughlin asserts his own right to proclaim his ideas in the press and on the air but that his professed followers are leaders in denying or trying to deny those rights to others. He cited the civil liberties rally in Jersey City, not disturbed in any way by any except Coughlin’s followers, one of whom actually had the brass to loudly am nounce that he had the ri£ht to break up the meeting (so another account states). Thomas went on to say to Coughlin:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Now this Jersey City experience was not unique. Groups professing to be your followers have violently broken up outdoor meetings; I am reliably informed, in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Philadelphia</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">and elsewhere, quite in European black- and brownshirt style. I myself .witnessed the amazing exhibition of your followers at a hearing before the board of education in New York city in favor of closing the schoolhouses to discussions of “controversial issues”. Yet the same crowd pickets radio stations very noisily in your behalf, and does it in the name of free speech! These things are bad enough in themselves. They are worse in the light of their parallel to the rise of totalitarian dictators in Eurone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Coughlin’s followers picketed ra-Jf di° station WMCA because that station refuses to carry his addresses. That was their right. But did rtSslfertiSia they have a right, after their twenty-third picketing, to pick a fight with those selling publications exposing Coughlin? Certainly not. But they did pick it, and it took 125 policemen to restore order on Broadway between Forty-eighth and Fiftieth streets on Sunday afternoon, May 21, 1939, because of that fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But when it came to Jehovah’s witnesses’ own convention in Madison Square Garden, June 25, 1939, and the Coughlinites had boasted beforehand that they would break up the convention, and marched on it with that end in view, Jehovah’s witnesses were most mightily and immediately and definitely interested. This is not the place to tell the story; it has appeared elsewhere. But the Coughlinites completely failed of their objective. They were put out as disturbers; and that is just what should be done in every assembly where they try to take away from others the rights which they claim for themselves, and which America so freely grants to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Brief Historical Sketch</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Coughlin’s great-grandfather helped dig the Erie Canal; his grandfather was a Buffalo carpenter; his father was a church sexton; and Charles E, Coughlin was born in Hamilton, Ontario, October 25,1891. He was educated in a parochial school, graduated in Toronto University, and, in 1926, was sent to Royal Oak, Michigan, to act as priest for twenty families. A natural orator with a fine voice, and Catholic training in all the arts of rhetoric, he made a radio hit from the first with those who are weak in the head. One attack on Hoover brought him in 1,200,000 letters, and an attack on a big business group brought in 600,000. As a rabble-rouser he is in the same class with Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The resemblance to Hitler’s methods has</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">-</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">been noted by many. The source of </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Hitler’s </span><span class="font12">wealth was his royalties on the book </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Mein v </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Kampf.</span><span class="font12"> A part of Coughlin’s income is derived from his biography and addresses, bound </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font12">one book and marketed for $3. Twelve of <sup>: </sup>Judge Rutherford’s wonderful books can </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font12">had for that money, and any one of them is worth a million times more to any person who wants to live through Armageddon than all the things Hitler and Coughlin have ever written or said or done in their whole lives, or than they will ever do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Coughlin has his critics. The editor of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Churchman,</span><span class="font12"> a Protestant Episcopal publiea- ' tion, recently said of him that he is engaged in ‘dropping a torch into a world filled with high explosives’. Dr. E. Boyd Barrett, author of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Rome Stoops to Conquer,</span><span class="font12"> said of him: “He is anti-labor, anti-Communist, and proFascist in the manner of his master, Pius XI, Like Pius, he is in an indirect way antiSemitic. . . . Father Coughlin has thus made himself the incomparable spokesman and sounding-board of the Holy Father.” Senator Bailey, of North Carolina, said of him:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There is nothing more sinister in our life right now than that Coughlin from the radio of the Shrine of the Little Flower . . . That voice stirs the depths of hate throughout the land of liberty, matches class against class, foments the fires of revolution, to crucify the American people upon his damnable ambition. Coughlin! Not “Father Coughlin” . . . When ... a minister of a church comes down into the political arena and goes out with his radio incendiarism to stir up the fountains of hate in a distressed land amongst a suffering people, I take it nothing amiss, and I make no apologies, but I will snatch the halo from his brow and throw it into the nearest spittoon, and then throw the spittoon into the gutter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Coughlin’s Relation to the Church</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In his letter to Judge Rutherford about Coughlin, it will be recalled that Dr. Lauring said<sub>:</sub> “The few scattered Catholics who have disavowed him have been like voices lost in the wilderness.” Al Smith called him a crackpot and Cardinal Mundelein said he is not a spokesman for the Catholic Church and his remarks should be considered only those of an individual. And “Reverend Father” James R. Cox of Pittsburgh (perhaps to shine up his own badly spattered escutcheon since he was arrested for misuse of the mails), referring to Coughlin, said: “A Catholic priest should be the last man to encourage rabble-rousing mob vengeance and mass hysteria.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">There </span><span class="font12">is also a curious story dating back to </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font12">days when Merlin Aylesworth, then president of National Broadcasting Company, was one day reported as testifying that it was a Catholic group that vetoed the application of Coughlin to speak over his network. The next day the transcript of the official record did not show that he had said what the reporters the day previous had said that he said. The moral </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">here </span><span class="font12">seems to be that the transcript had been fixed to suit the exigencies of the case. Ayles-worth probably said it, but the Hierarchy did not wish to have it in the record that one of their greatest ‘heroes’ was not acceptable to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Probably Coughlin knows better how he stands with the Roman Hierarchy than does anybody else. He talks personally with Rome by radiophone, and his bishop is solidly behind him. The Vatican has never disavowed him. Coughlin has said publicly that Bishop Gallagher (now dead) and the pope were back of him. Gallagher said that the voice of Coughlin is the voice of God. His words were:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I pronounce Father Coughlin sound in doctrine, able in its application and interrelation. Freely I give him my imprimatur on his written word and freely I give my approval on the spoken word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Throughout the pages of his paper occur again and again the words “Reverend Charles </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">E. </span><span class="font12">Coughlin, LL.D, (by permission of his Ecclesiastical Superior)”. Does this show any indication that the Hierarchy disapproves of this man?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When in June, 1938, there was issued from Royal Oak the statement over Coughlin’s signature, “I regret to state that on specific instructions from my superiors I am advised to withdraw from all public appearances until next November,” Coughlin claimed that the statement was sent out by one of his secretaries. Whatever the facts, it is certain that the Hierarchy is in close touch with the whole situation and very generally endorsing everything Coughlin does. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When he resumed broadcasts January 10, 193ft after fourteen months off the air, Coughlin said, “I understand that my radio teaching is subject to the supervision of my immediate superior, the Archbishop of Detroit”: also, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">“I </span><span class="font12">deplore the confusing agitation which has </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">been </span><span class="font12">fostered by Social Service.” Take out of these statements what you see fit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The manager of radio station WJR, Detroit, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font12">declared that Coughlin’s sermons have the approval of Archbishop Edward Mooney, of Detroit. He ought to know, and his </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">name, Lew </span><span class="font12">Fitzpatrick, suggests that he is of the same church. When the question was put direct to Mooney he gave a typical Hierarchy straddling answer by explaining that &quot;Catholic Church authorities, in passing on writings or utterances, make a clear distinction between permission and approval”. The effect of such equivocations is to make honest, straightforward persons certain that the Catholic Church is back of Fascism, body&quot; and soul, but doesn’t want the name of it until after the game is in the bag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One of Coughlin’s stooge organizations is the so-called “Committee for the Defense of American Constitutional Rights”, You can judge of about how much value it would be </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font12">preserving American rights when you know that at one of its meetings the 6,000 persons present made the sign of the cross and were led in it by the “Reverend Father” Edward </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">J. </span><span class="font12">Higgins. He and they believe it right to murder persons teaching independently of the Roman Catholic church organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Converted to Fascism</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Coughlin never stays converted to anything very long. What he really wants is dictatorial power, no matter how he gets it. A year or more ago he proposed the abandonment of the American form of government, and a Fascist system of representation in which the members of the House of Representatives would be elected according to class, as in Italy </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">and Rus</span><span class="font12">sia. Thus cotton farmers, steel workers, .coal miners, doctors, industrialists in each branch of industry, and all other classes, would </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">in</span><span class="font12">corporate and choose their own representatives. People are easier to control la chessboard”. Divide the country up into such classes (as it was in the Dark Ages, with its various guilds), and all that is necessary is to secretly control the leaders. Can you guess' who would do the controlling ? See Italy, Germany, Spain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">His magazine said last fall that the only unbiased source of truth is “Father” Coughlin. Do you remember the Italian statement, “Mussolini is always right”? Do you know that that is the way the German people speak of Hitler ? During the Ethiopian war Coughlin was all for Mussolini. That tells where his heart is. Mussolini reciprocates: the Italian newspaper </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Regime Fascist a</span><span class="font12"> praised him to the skies this very year, saying, “It is impossible for Italians not to express their sympathy with this apostle of Christianity.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As Coughlin’s sympathies are with Mussolini and with Franco the Butcher, so they are also with the German outfit run by the man who murdered his best friend. The New York </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font12"> printed, in parallel columns, extracts from Coughlin’s talks and those of Goebbels, Hitler’s Jesuit-trained propaganda minister, showing their similarities. At the Nazi German American Bund meeting held at Madison Square Garden, New York, February 20,1939, the mention of Coughlin’s name was followed by the greatest ovation of the night. And Coughlin is alleged to have said of Hitler that he is the best Christian in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Converted to Nazism</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Not only are whole sections of Coughlin’s talks mere translations of Goebbel’s preachments to the German people, but he follows Hitler’s methods and principles, or lack of them. Thus he has learned that hate is a more powerful motive than love and works it to the limit. He has also learned the force that comes from the hammering reiteration of a few narrow ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Catholic magazine </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Commonweal </span><span class="font12">courageously referred to “his cavalier disregard for pertinent historical testimony, his insensitiveness to the consequences of his acts on German and Italian Jews [and] his all too pious acceptance of propaganda from a party whose Fuehrer proudly boasts his machine is based in huge lies”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Review of Reviews</span><span class="font12"> said: “It has not escaped the notice of observers that the general contour of his doctrine is oddly similar to that of National Socialism (Hitlerism). Although the Nazi dictator has abandoned virtually the whole of the program which he sold to the German people in 1930, the fact remains that it was excellent political copy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The St. Paul </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Pioneer Press</span><span class="font12"> said of him, “There is no longer any doubt as to what Father Coughlin is up to. This man, who burns with an unpriestly ambition for worldly power, has observed how Hitler arose out of the flames of prejudice; and he does not scruple to belie his sacred office by attempting here in America to arouse a race hatred against the Jews as a means of achieving his purpose. His unctuous disavowals of this purpose, while he utters falsehoods and misrepresentations, do not conceal his meaning, but bring it out more clearly. His technique is to retail Nazi propaganda, and then squirm out of responsibility by professing to deplore it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Dr. Harry F. Ward, of New York, chairman of the American League for Peace and Democracy, said of him, “He is constantly slipping over subtle defenses for Hitler and equally subtle suggestions that democracy is not working over here and that Fascism is working better over there” and that his goal is “a controlled totalitarian state in which the church is the ruling force”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When Coughlin made his 14-month retirement from the air, in October, 1937, the </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">New </span><span class="font12">York </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font12"> said of him, “The more he said, the more clearly he was revealing himself as </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">sanctimonious stooge for special interests, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">reactionary with more than a streak of Fascist ideas.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is well known in New York that there is an open alliance between Coughlin and the German Bund. On the day before the Bund meeting there was a Coughlin meeting in New York, and at that meeting literature and tickets for the Bund meeting were distributed. At the Bund meeting itself Coughlin was the hero of the day. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">r &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">No man in public life ever told more lies or got caught at them more quickly than Coughlin did when he started his lying campaign against the Jews, and that right in the midst of their horrible sufferings in Germany. He published the so-called “Protocols of Zion”, which all now know to be forgeries. He charged that wealthy American </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Jews </span><span class="font12">financed the Russian revolution; </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">but Keren</span><span class="font12">sky, one-time premier of Russia, immediately declared that there was not a single Jew in the first government established by the </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">revo</span><span class="font12">lution. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">He claimed that the American Secret Service had provided the above information, and that it was included in the unabridged British white paper which he had. Then the chief of the United States Secret Service, Frank' J. Wilson, denied that any such report had ever been made, and the British Government, both in London and in New York, produced copies of the original white paper and showed that no such statement had ever been made; and Coughlin had to admit that he did not have the paper, apd had never seen it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Professor Johan Smeretenko convinced radio station WMCA that Coughlin had been </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">broad</span><span class="font12">casting untruths, and they announced over the </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">air </span><span class="font12">that he had “unfortunately uttered </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">eer-</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">tain mistakes of fact”—a nice way of telling the world what he is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">He mentioned Kuhn, Loeb &amp;&nbsp;Co. as having had a share in fomenting the Russian revolu-tion; and that concern announced that it had never had any relations, financial or otherwise, with any government in Russia, Czarist, Kerensky or Communist. Then he supposedly quoted from a Jewish magazine to back up one of his statements; and it was seen that he misquoted the article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Then he charged that present economic distress is due to the international Jewish bankers; and figures were produced showing, that only one Jewish banking firm, Kuhn, Loeb &amp;&nbsp;Company, had participated in the loans to which he referred and their share was 2.88 percent of the total. In other words. Coughlin’s charge was 97.12 percent false and he is not a 100-pcreent liar. Neither is Hitler; it is not scientific.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Eddie Cantor, motion picture comedian, said of Coughlin, “Father Coughlin is a great orator, but I doubt that he has a sincere atom in his entire system.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Friend of Big Business</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">No person has panned Big Business harder than Coughlin, but he is a personal friend of </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">W. </span><span class="font12">R. Hearst, champion of Fascism in the United States. When he begs over the radio he gets results. When he talks, the people pay for it and are glad to do it. When he lectured in Madison Square Garden the crowd paid from 50 cents to $2 a head to hear his what some have called “poisonous and inflammatory economic and social nonsense”; yet his gang were not willing that Jehovah’s witnesses should have Judge Rutherford lecture to the public fkke, but had to try to break up the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At the very time Coughlin was blowing about stock market chicanery over the radio, his secretary, without his knowledge, so he </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">says,</span><span class="font12"> invested $20,000 of his surplus funds in such a way as to rake in $100,000 net on the deal. It is a good thing Coughlin did not know about it, or he would have put in ten times as much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">He is a good cardplayer; sometimes plays until 12; 30 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">His first church burned at exactly the right time. How odd! Catholic institutions that have served their time have a habit of burning - just when the insurance funds would come in best. This $30,000 shack went up just aS</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">12</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Coughlin was moving into his million-dollar silo whore he now holds forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Coughlin says the laborer is on the side of the angels, but when he built his new shrine he refused to have anything to do with union labor, and the wages he paid were 25 percent to 40 percent below trade union rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The New Republic</span><span class="font12"> stated that “the two most prominent purveyors of lies in the United States at present are Representative Dies and Father Coughlin”. Wonder why they said that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In November, 1935, Coughlin stated: “At no time has it been or will it be our desire to establish a so-called ‘third party’.” He established such a party within a year thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">He is flexible in his convictions, having been a New Dealer three times. A friend of Roosevelt, he called the president a liar and a scab. A ‘lover of labor’, he denounced the CIO; and John W. Edelman, of that organization, said of him, “We recognize Father Coughlin as an unscrupulous man.” Nothing worse could be said of anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">He is conceited beyond the power of language; he has suggested bullets instead of ballots, to put his changing ideas across.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">He said, “We Christians with a united front could go forth and do in one year in the United States what Franco accomplished in Spain.” His gang tried some of it, on a mild scale, in Madison Square Garden, June 25, 1939.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As showing that this person imagines he is America’s future Hitler, he said in his broadcast of January 1, 1939: “Let those who are with us reap the rewards ; let those who oppose us by their silence or their action suffer the consequences.” That is a typical Hitler threat.</span></p>

Coughlin: Priest, Gambler, Hypocrite” the Freethinkers of America, in their February (1939) </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font12"> published some reproductions from the Detroit </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Free</span><span class="font12"> Press showing some of this man’s financial transactions. These will be found on pages 18-19, and are well worth examination by anyone who is interested in the peculiar phenomenon holding forth at Royal Oak, Michigan. The fact that there are millions of Americans fallen so low as to pay any attention to a man of this type shows the desperately low moral and intellectual estate of vast numbers of the American people and their need of God’s government of peace, truth, honor and justice and love,— Elton Groves.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Gradually Caving In</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Gradually caving in, the New York board of regents finally yielded what they hitherto refused, and now the clique that is out to control the schools and everything else in the state can arrange for the children to be excused from one of the precious thirty hours per week of schooling, so that they may receive religious instruction that “Mary is the mother of God”, and that God is so sore at humanity that unless somebody pays .his priests well most of them will have to cook for eternity. But if the money is forthcoming to the right bagman, then the poor apes can get to heaven, where they can enjoy the company of the Torquemadas, the Bloody Marys and the Borgias who succeeded in crashing the gate in ages ago!.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Who Was to Get Worthless Stock?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">♦ A story in the New York </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span><span class="font12"> is incomplete. It sets forth that a lawyer arranged with Monsignor John M. Kiely to dispose of “some worthless stock held by the priest”. The priest gave the lawyer $500 commission for putting through the deal, and the lawyer gave the priest his check for $2,600, the price of the stock. Something went ■wrong. Probably the lawyer could not find any sucker that would pay $2,600 for the “worthless stock held by the priest”. Anyway, the $2,600 check bounced back and the priest mourns his $500 paid to the lawyer, and at last reports was trying to get it back. The missing part of the story is a description of the stock, and who 'was to pay out $2,600 for what the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font12"> says was “worthless”.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>New York’s Police Force</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">♦ .The London </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Universe</span><span class="font12"> carries the interesting information that of the 18,000 persons on New York’s police force 12,000 are Roman Catholics; also that the chaplain of these 12,000, the “Reverend Father” Joseph A. McCaffrey, has been made a lieutenant colonel In the United States Army. Is it the fashion now for city chaplains to be made officers in the United States Army? Why? Also, and the items may have a relation to one another, there come reports from Washington that the Army is to be “vitalized” by removing 2,300 high-ranking officers from their jobs, and putting younger men in their places. One wonders if the complexion of the Army is to be altered to suit the ambitions of the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Meat on St. Patrick’s Day</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">♦ St. Patrick, it seems, was not a Roman Catholic, but is nevertheless the patron “saint” of the cathedral and archdiocese of New York. For that reason, on St. -Patrick’s day, March 17, 1939, Roman Catholics in New York were permitted to eat meat, despite the fact that the day came on Friday. More religious foolishness, of no possible benefit to anybody except the dealers in meat.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Rachel McDowell Again</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">Rachel McDowell, “religious” editor of the New York </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font12"> writer who wrote weepy stories about Pope Pius r &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xi’s tenderness, etc., has broken</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">&quot; loose again. This time she expatiated on the fact that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which hates American public schools worse than anything else, would stage an annual communion breakfast of a so-called “Board of Education’s Bureau of Attendance Catholic League” at which 2,000 guests would be present. While the principal speakers would be members of the Hierarchy, yet the president of the board of education of New York city was expected to be there in all his glory, to give apparent sanction to this un-American organization’s activities.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Religious Excitement in Buffalo</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Big religious excitement in Buffalo. First, the “Reverend Father” John J. Nash said that “there are certain enemies of religion today who are carrying on their propaganda in these United States against religion”, and, “These enemies are not outside the walls clamoring to get in; they are within our gates” and they “avowedly tell us that religion is an antidote, a soporific, invented by the priestcraft to quiet the people and prevent them from thinking”, and that these tactics are “only a prelude to a campaign of violence designed to destroy religion and the things that spring from it”, and that “they’re here on the plea of free speech”, and “I maintain that we must take action to halt this situation, or avow ourselves foolish before the whole civilized world”. Nash says that &quot;every American is in favor of free speech”. He does not say who are these persons who now have free speech, but who should have it taken away, nor does he say who should do the taking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There was more excitement when, at the same meeting, the Most Reverend” John A. Duffy made the mistake of saying that Exodus 20:7 is the second commandment. To be sure, it is the second commandment according to his religion, but not according to the Bible, as you can see for yourself if you refer to Exodus </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">20:</span><span class="font12">4, where anybody may see that the second commandment is, “Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image,” instead of &quot;Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain”. Bishop Duffy should throw his religion into the ash can. It is </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font12">no good. He should accept Christianity instead. Oh, oh, this is talking against religion, and Nash does not like things like that. Now isn’t that just too bad </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">1</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Hierarchy Sore on Spanish Veterans </span><span class="font12">♦ When the 149 members of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade of the Spanish Republic returned from Spain they wanted to place a wreath on what is called the Eternal Light in Madison Square Park, but the Hierarchy was sore at the idea, and so Lieutenant Charles Maura of the New York police department, and Terrence Cusick, one of the employees of the New York City Department of Parks, forbade them to do it. In order not to offend the Hierarchy, the wreath, bearing the title “In memory of those who died for democracy”, was placed outside the railing surrounding the base. Another great victory for Franco, the pope and the Devil.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Enlarged Gall Bladder</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">♦ A certain physician received a series of requests to donate money to the building of a pew Catholic hospital. At length he gave up $100. Then he received a request to purchase tickets at $10 a ticket. Becoming shy of sending more money, he received another notice to purchase tickets, stating that &quot;this is the second request”. Then he received an invitation to a dinner at $1.50 a plate; this was also ignored. Then a committee called the physician’s nurse and told her to remind the doctor that he had not ordered his tickets, and that if he found it impossible to attend the dinner, to please send the money or a subscription anyway, and lastly the same request was made by mail. The physician’s wife wants to know—</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If all outside of the Catholic church are Communists, Reds and heathen, why do they accept or even want the money which non-Catholics have?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>&quot;Shall Our Hearts Remain Cold?”</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">♦ The Scripture declaration is that “the dead know not any thing” (Ecclesiastes 9:5), and that when a person dies “his thoughts perish” (Psalm 146:4),which fully explains why people working the worst of all rackets • do all possible to discourage the common , &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people from possess</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">ing the Scriptures, or using them. </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Martin </span><span class="font12">J. Blake, C.M., Our Lady of Angels Novena, Niagara University, N. Y., writes as follows, and you can either believe what he says or believe the Scriptures. Take your choice. It is a free country, and if you wish to believe something that is not true, and that will never do you or anybody else the least bit of good here or hereafter, just go right ahead </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font12">support the racket:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Hopefully and expectantly the Souls in Purgatory look to us for help. Because we do not see them suffer, shall our hearts remain cold? Because we do not hear them plead, shall our ears rem</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">ain </span><span class="font12">deaf?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The big idea is to come across with a dollar. You can imagine who gets the dollar, and </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">how </span><span class="font12">much good it will do to people, that are asleep iri death.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Monks Find Their Tongues</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">♦ The monks of the Trappist Monastery </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font12">Mount St. Bernard, England, do not generally indulge in talking. Only with permission and on special occasions do they engage in conversation. Such a special occasion arose when their new church was on show and many visitors came to look it over, including numerous girls (wearing trousers, slacks and shorts) who wandered all over the monastery grounds. The monks generally consider conversation a sin (and maybe it is in their case), but on this occasion the salutary association with normal people made things all right. The monks could talk to the ladies without sinning.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Best They Could Do</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">♦ The Roman Hierarchy is often embarrassed in its attempts to place its own men in the key positions of the world, and so compromise is frequently necessary. It is therefore of interest that the new British ambassador to the United States is not an out-and-out Roman Catholic, as is the American ambassador to Britain. The most that can be said, in his case, is that his father was a Roman Catholic. He is, however, an admirer of Hitler and will be very useful to both the Hierarchy and Hitler in his new position. He thinks Britain should pay the U, S. what it has borrowed, and is not at all wrong in his view that this would put Britain in a mighty lot better standing in this country than it now occupies.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>A Mere Oversight</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">♦ An ad soliciting funds for the building of the Liverpool Metropolitian Cathedral (Catholic) states that those who donate £1 will have their names subscribed in a book of remembrance. It quotes Malachi 3:16, but examination of the verse fails to reveal any mention of the money consideration. A mere oversight, perhaps. The ad further states that “for all time this book will remain within the precincts of a Glorious Temple”. In these days of bombs and air raids it is best not to be too sure of that.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>Noyes’ Book Now Approved</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Noyes’ book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Voltaire</span><span class="font12"> has been condemned by the Vatican, but as they gave no explanation of their condemnation, he went ahead with its publication anyway. Seeing they could not bluff him, the Hierarchy compromised, and a preface explaining the “difficulty” makes the book acceptable. It wouldn’t do to antagonize the British reading public at this juncture.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Skillful Publicity Work ' * .</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">♦ No matter how much honest people may hold its lack of principle in utter contempt, there are few who, if they knew the facts, could withhold a measure of admiration (Rev. </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">17; </span><span class="font12">6) at the skillful manner in which the Roman Hierarchy used the pictures of victims slain by Franco’s hordes to obtain money for Franco’s cause. Sailing under a name as misleading as its cause, and by the use of 3,000 passes, the so-called “American Committee for Spanish Relief” managed to </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">get </span><span class="font12">12,000 people to attend their pageant in Madison Square Garden. They had previously advertised widely that 20,000 would be there. Is America’s capacity for propaganda shrinking?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Reporters Embarrassed</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Reporters were embarrassed when suddenly, on an evening in midsummer, 200 boys at the New York Catholic Protectory, 1900 East Tremont Avenue, Bronx, began shouting and smashing windows, declaring that they were whipped frequently and denied the freedom to which they were entitled. It seems that somebody sent for the police and the reporters could not understand why Deputy Inspector John S. Burke refused to give them any information about the affair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One of the boys tossed out a note reading as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At 5:30 a boy got hit for nothing he do so we. took matters into our own hands this place is worse than Sing Sing the brothers dogs eat better stuff than us so please print this we got a week in the cell full of rats eat hard bread and water.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>New Form of Ouija Board</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">♦ A new form of ouija board, called a liedetector, may soon come into use. It is the invention of the “Reverend Father” Summers of the Roman Catholic Fordham University, New York, and was written up at length by John McClain in the New York </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Journal and American.</span><span class="font12"> The machine is supposed to be able to distinguish between different kinds of fear. Its evidence has already been accepted in one of the New York courts. The record is that “the defendant was declared not guilty almost solely because of the mute testimony of the device”. If it can make a guilty man innocent, it can do the reverse, and opens up fine prospects of a new line of torture for those who seek to maintain their integrity in this evil day.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>Must Study Geography</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">♦ There is nothing like getting your </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">geography lesson right if you wish to shorten your days in “Purgatory” or some other place like it that does not exist. That seems to be the drift of Cardinal Mundelein’s order that Roman Catholics of his diocese might eat all the meat they wished on Friday, December 31, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">1937, </span><span class="font12">but only if they , stayed within the diocese. On one side of the diocese border roast ham was O.K.; on the other side it was fish or “Purgatory”. If the man was just on the line when he ate, then it al] depended on which side of him or which end of him was on the diocese'side of the line. Suppose his head was in the diocese and the rest of his body outside, he could eat ham ; but if his head was over the line and his body in the diocese, he must eat fish. It would make a big difference to God. And it helps lots in studying geography.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>Mother Cabrini of the Nobility</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">♦ The business of making a “saint” out of Mother Cabrini progresses. It will cost lots of money; it always does. Baek in the days of the apostles anybody could be a saint, but the apostles were simple persons. They never even thought of the possibilities of graft in the saint business. It is not denied that Mother Cabrini founded seven convents; nobody has to be a saint to do that. And she was of the Lombard nobility, and that doesn’t make a saint out of anybody, nor does even her residence in Chicago. What will make her a “saint”, and the only thing that will do it, is that enough persons come across with the coin to make the performance worth while. A show can’t be run for nothing.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>“Reverend” Hayes Decently Married</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">♦ On his death it was brought to light that the “Reverend Father” William R. Hayes, pastor of St. Mary’s Roman Catholic Church, Newburgh, N. Y., had been decently married for two years before his death. The facts came out when it was learned that all but $1 of this $80,000 estate was left to his wife. The natives of Virginia Beach, Va., did not know that he was a Roman Catholic priest, and the Roman Catholics of Newburgh, N. Y., did not know he was married, and so he managed to get along. As he left nothing for the repose of his soul in “purgatory”, it is likely that he was familiar with the Bible truth that the dead are dead and that there is no sueh place as “purgatory”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">♦ The Catholic press makes no effort to conceal that it is pro-Fascist. It well knows that it is the heart and soul of the whole totalitarian scheme of government. The London </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald</span><span class="font12"> ran a feature article by J. L. Bene-venisti (probably a priest) in which the theme, set in an artistic box in the center of the story, was the catch-phrase:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Totalitarian governments are carrying out measures which, democracies carefully avoid suggesting, could be utilised all over the world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">♦ How they love to smear on the big </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">figures. </span><span class="font12">The London </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald</span><span class="font12"> said of the four-hour ceremony of the pope putting on his three-story hat that “it is estimated that 500,000,000 people were listening”. The next inquiry is, Who made the estimate? and the answer is that it must have been somebody that is insane; for no person of sound sense would imagine it for a minute. That is more than one-fourth of all the people in the world, and they speak 3,500 languages.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>Vatican Piggery Plundered by the Pigs!</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">♦ In Pierre van Faassen’s </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Days of Our Years, </span><span class="font12">concerning conditions as he saw them in Spain, occurs (on page 425) the following paragraph : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I had seen religious processions in 1931, one </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font12">Seville and one in Saragossa, still another in Caceres, a small town where there were thirty-eight monasteries, the one standing next to the other in an endless row like the cathedrals in the Kremlin of Moscow, processions carrying a golden-diademed statue of the Virgin which was literally buried under jewels, diamonds, rubies, smaragds and other precious stones, including decorations and stars of the kind worn by victorious generals and diplomats on their gala uniforms. Priests in golden vestments walked under baldachins of purple and damask, swinging censers of silver and filigree, preceded by banners of silk and jewel-studded croziers, surrounded by laee-wearing acolytes, train bearers and boys in violet soutanes carrying glittering boxes containing relics, followed by </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a monstrance of a value of three million pesetas </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font12">burst upon the eye like a cluster of diamonds. And looking on, pouring from the putrid alleys of the Triana quarter in Seville, and saluting the Retd Presence by dropping on their knees, I had seen the hollow-cheeked, ragged, barefooted Magdalenes, the disheveled women, the unkempt hungry children, the very flesh and blood of Jesus. ■</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font12">book, written by a judge of one of the courts of Mexico (which book is now in possession of the president of the Watchtower </span><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bible and Tract Society), states that </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font12">each year, over a period of years prior to </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font12">smashing of the Hierarchy there, the poor </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">peo</span><span class="font12">ple of Mexico contributed 30 million dollars in gold to the Vatican.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Time and again in hit radio addresses Father Charles E. Coughlin has declared in the tones of a prophet &lt;rf doouQi about &quot;throwing the money dangers oui<sup>1 </sup>of the temple” and using such colorful and poetic phrases about people and poli-cies he didn't like as &quot;seeking the flesh-pots of Egypt,” “a crap game played with other people's money,&quot; &quot;his torch of greed to the edifice of our prosperity/' etc, etc. To the simple minded, his denunciations made them believe that </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">he</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> must be epitome of virtue, self-denial with no interest save that of suffering, enslaved humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">But other humble people who, however, knew (heir Shakespeare well became a little suspicious of all this nylat —“methinks the man doth protest too much.&quot; They started a little investigation of the good father’s—not private life —but  private bank account. The results were more startling than they could have imagined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">This hypocritical priest who was so-vitriolic against stock-market gamblers, bankers and others in that category was playing the stock-market himself. The nickels, dimes and dollar bills that he collected from his gullible listeners, ostensibly for the Shrine of the Little Flower, were tossed as so much duckot feed in the greedy Jaws of the Stock-market exchange and as quickly devoured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">On this page we reprint from the Detroit Free Press of March 29, 1933, some photostatic copies of Coughlin's bank and I stock-market accounts which show Irrefutably his gambling activities.</span></p>

Many of the prisoners came up after the lectures, to get some literature, and we gave out some 150 pieces, and put 10 bound books in the prison library.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One of the prisoners approached the car and said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I want to congratulate you people for having the courage to do and say the things you have done and said here today, and not only here, but everywhere. I have never seen anything like it elsewhere. Wherever you people are located, you always boldly express your belief without fear. That takes courage. The others don’t have it. I guess you are the only people in the world that have the courage to declare your doctrines fearlessly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Another peculiarly interesting thing was the conduct of a man whq seemed to us at first to be showing an uncanny interest in what we were doing. We thought he might be intending mischief among his fellows, but were pleasantly surprised, when the lecture was over, to find that he knows something of the Scriptures, and was bearing up the standard of truth to his comrades. ■</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">♦ The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Northwest Review</span><span class="font12"> (Catholic) is very much mistaken in thinking it can get Catholic people to do what Jehovah’s witnesses are doing, It cannot he done. Only an overwhelming love for the Creator and a determination to do His will at all costs would ever persuade any to do what the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Review</span><span class="font12"> contemplates when</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">it says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.....</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If Jehovah’s witnesses can push their campaign we can be just as aggressive. They are not satisfied to stand outside the door of the home. They go in to the family and teach their doctrines to children and adults. They send teachers and missionaries into schools, colleges, factories, lumber camps and into every nook and corner of society.</span></p>

Would you give me your name and address ?” Why, certainly we would; but just why did he want such information! He explained in brief that it was a regulation that whenever someone left literature he was to get their names. We remarked that this had all the earmarks of Fascism, and wished to know by whom and why such an order had been given. He became very flustered and said that the information was for his own </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">knowl</span><span class="font12">edge, thus contradicting himself in less than half a minute. : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;':</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">ter she answered: “I do not want to salute the flag.” The teacher had her sit down, and later called her into another room, asking why she did not wish to salute the flag. Tr---- an</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">swered, “I do not want to be on the Devil’s side, because God is going to destroy all that are on the Devil’s side.

<p><span class="font12">she goes to a class where she studies the Bible so she’ll know how to be on God’s side. And my Aunt B---- plays records for people so</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">during flag salute, etc. What religion do you belong to?” I then explained that we did not belong to a religion; that there was a vast difference between religion and Christianity. I told her that the booklet </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Protection</span><span class="font12"> explains the difference between religion and Christianity, and asked if she wished to read it.

And then, as the manager of radio station KCMC, he refused to allow Jehovah’s witnesses to broadcast the “Exposed” series of lectures, subsequently run in this magazine. In other words, the Hierarchy has rights which must be recognized and respected, but Jehovah’s witnesses have no rights whatever. Consistency, thou art a jewel.</span></p>

At that time he seemed very pleased to have obtained it, but a week later came in, hot and bothered, complaining of the statement on page 281 which partly reads, “Amongst her instruments that she uses are ultraselflsh men called Jews who only look for selfish gain, and who therefore readily yield to and join with the Hierarchy in any unrighteous schemes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font12">endeavored to explain, but he would not have it so, said he would have some one else to read it, and just then there “happened” to come in a Catholic associate, an executive in the same shoe concern. He read the paragraphs, became even more infuriated, slammed the book down, and said he would not patronize a place that supported such sentiments. That same day the workers of the shoe concern were called together, and told to boycott my shop. Not content with cutting off my trade from their own employees, they sent out to surrounding shoe jobbers, asking them and their workers to boycott me. I tried to stick it out, and called on some parties to use their influence to alleviate the situation, but finally had to'sell out. The partnership in boycott between the Jews and Catholics accomplished its purpose.

<p><span class="font12">♦ In a St. George, Staten Island, restaurant, one day in spring, a young woman was dining next to a table at which were four men. One of the men wanted the work of Jehovah’s witnesses stopped. Another protested, “I would not want to have a hand in stopping them. If what they say is true, just think of what will happen to anyone who tries to silence them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At this point a priest walked in. All got up and greeted him respectfully and then one mentioned the above conversation. He looked annoyed, and dismissed it with the expression, “Oh, that stuff!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The conversation turned to politics. One of the men said, “But the Church is prominent in politics.” With a lordly gesture the priest this time said, “Of course. It is the duty of the Qhurch to lead the poor misguided people in all things.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The conversation turned again to the original topic, and the priest this time said, <sup>tc</sup>In a little while, you won’t hear a peep out of these Jehovah’s witnesses.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Everybody knows that if there is anything anathema to Communists it is the Word of God; they have as little use for it as has Frank Hague. What Isserman was “guilty” of was ' defending two little children in their educational rights because they love God and reverence His Word. Just to have the record clear it should be explained that these little folks were simply Christians, and not “religious” in the sense of having any connection with scribes, Pharisees, priests, ministers, or other hypocrites, like Hague himself. Hague is religious, but not a Christian. He gave $75,000 at one time to one of the “religious” outfits of Newark, and did it out of a $6,000 a year salary at that. But that was easy for Hague, Jersey City’s ex-patrolman.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark89"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark90"></a>Why the Persecution?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ 8. </span><span class="font12">K. Bryson, in the Baltimore </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Sun, </span><span class="font12">is just not able to see why anybody should be persecuted for being conscientious in the matter of worshiping Almighty God. He asks:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">-OCTOBER 4, 1039</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Why this fear of and inane desire to coerce these children of Jehovah’s witnesses ? It can never be said they are Communists, Reds, etc., because in every instance upon investigation it has been found their parents are thoroughly law-abiding, God-fearing people. Investigation has disclosed also they place God above and before everything else. Hence, their refusal to salute the flag, not because they disrespect the flag, but rather because they fear to disrespect God. Surely parents of that sort are not likely to raise incorrigible, dangerous children. Then why the persecution?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark91"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark92"></a>What Would Happen?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">♦ You wonder what would happen to the nation in time of war if all Americans refused to salute. If every American refused to salute for the same reason that Jehovah’s witnesses refuse, namely, because of complete devotion to Jehovah, and obedience to His Word, then no nation nor combination of nations, however strong, could prevail against America, for it would then be a Christian nation, and the Bible says, “Blessed is that nation whose God is the Lord.” Psalm 33,12. Douay (Catholic) version, Psalm 32, 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This blessedness and safety would belong to any nation which truly served the Lord. His witnesses are in every country on the earth, and do riot salute any flag in any land. The Scriptures state that no nation on earth today is worthy to endure, because each has broken the everlasting covenant of Jehovah concerning the sanctity of human life. This is all explained in the twenty-fourth chapter of Isaiah. War has shed the blood of many innocents, and in the battle of Armageddon, which rapidly approaches, Jehovah God himself will take vengeance on the nations because of their wholesale slaughter of human lives. The people of God on earth will take no part in that day of vengeance; they now merely proclaim its approach, warning the people to take their stand on the side of the Lord, loving Him and trusting Him for preservation when His destruction of the wicked in the earth begins.—Ernest Genske, in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Post Gazette.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">How Passenger Pigeons Were Destroyed </span><span class="font12">♦ Ornithologists and many others lament the complete destruction of passenger pigeons by ruthless and cruel man. The way this was accomplished was, largely, to catch a live pigeon, sew his eyes shut with silk thread, and -place him on a stool in the woods. When a flock of pigeons came in sight he was jerked off his stool. His comrades from the skies came to see what was wrong with him and flew about him in short circles. Crafty man dropped over the group a huge net previously arranged, and hundreds more were caught, either to be slain or themselves used as “stool pigeons”—whence the name given to informers.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark94"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark95"></a>Marching to the Sea</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Just as sure as day follows night do we know that precisely on a certain day next May rpillions of crabs are going to rise up out of their holes on Crab island and march to the sea. Why every single one of these millions upon millions of crustaceans should, simultaneously, feel this irrepressible urge to strike out for the sea on the same day every year, is one of Nature’s most baffling mysteries. And the wonder of it is, they never miscalculate! The power that governs this movement is as undeviating as that which rules the'planets of the universe. And when this urge overtakes them, nothing can stop them; houses, cliffs--no thing; for the West Indian land crabs march straight as an arrow to their destination.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19391004_files/g_E_19391004-20.png" alt="" style="width:43pt;height:42pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">When this frantic march is on they elimb over any obstacle that happens to be in their way. Even at the peril of their own lives they will clamber over cliffs and hedges rather than go around them. Houses are not even considered mild obstacles to these marching crustaceans. They creep in at the windows, climb over the beds and furniture, and emerge on the other side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Their movement looks as if the whole sur-» face of the ground were in motion. The earth is so thickly blanketed with them that it is a physical impossibility to walk without treading upon them. And the noise they make has often been likened to the din of cavalry troops in action. When these crabs are on the march, all animals beat a hasty retreat, for no living creature is safe in their path. Even the erabs </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">24 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ </span><span class="font12">themselves are in great danger from their own kind. If one of them happens to fall and injure its legs, it is immediately eaten up by the horde.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This is their nuptial march, and when they reach the sea they immediately plunge into the water to bathe and lay their eggs. The eggs wash ashore and in due time are hatched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When the young erabs come out every tree; root for miles around is densely covered with them. They remain near the seashore until old enough to travel, then they move inland from one to three miles and dig holes in the hills. In these holes they live until the next May, when again it is time for another frantic march to the sea.—Wesley A. Grout, in Our </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Dumb Animals.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">♦ Of course, the president was confused when he said in his message to Congress (and it was the only time such a thing was ever said by any American president) that religion </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font12">democracy are linked together as one and the same thing, and worth fighting for with all the national power. Christianity is the will of God, as expressed in His Word, and is indeed a proper objective for any people. But religion originated with the Devil, and consists merely in compliance with the forms and ceremonies and practices of tradition, and is actually against God. At the time of the World War the German kaiser (though certainly not a Christian—for no militarist is that) was one of the most religious persons in the world. He was then, and perhaps still is, an ordained minister of the official German Lutheran Church. Did that make him democratic? Washington newspaper correspondents took note of the fact that Roosevelt’s discovery that religion and democracy are one and the same thing followed a week in which ho was extremely engaged with the clergy, from Mundelein down. The clergy know why they are just now very much concerned about this matter of religion, and so dp Jehovah’s witnesses, who have been circulating </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">♦ Uncle Sam did not know when he sallied forth in 1917 to “make the world safe for democracy” that Italy had been promised part of Austria, Rumania had been promised part of Hungary, Serbia had been promised part of Austro-Hungary, France had been promised Alsace Lorraine, ^Poland had been promised parts of Austria and Germany, and the determination had been made to create a new nation out of what became Czechoslovakia, but was formerly Germany and Austria. All the treaty of Versailles accomplished was to ratify deals made before Uncle Sam was enticed into the fight. After he was in he was told what he must agree to.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">British Comment</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">By J. H emery {London)</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark122"></a>Holiday Freedom</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">[Written before the war]</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">• The fear of war has not prevented, nor apparently affected, the usual enjoyment of the summer holidays. True there has been, and is, the feeling that the holidays may be rudely interrupted; for no one knows what surprise Hitler may spring, nor when it is likely to come. The Bank of England returns show that more money—paper which is supposed to represent gold—is in circulation than at any previous time; in other words the record is broken. The amount in circulation is close to £522,000,000. The holiday season is responsible for some increase, helped by the new law which gives employees two weeks holiday with pay, and the increased employment through the war preparation is a contributory cause. The travel agencies report that bookings to the continent are much less than usual: very few Britishers are traveling to Germany, but more are going to France, and Italy is getting a fair share of the tourist traffic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Holiday camps are increasing in number and in capacity and general conveniences. Some are now settled on a rather elaborate basis. From a rough collection of huts and tents many of the camps have grown into permanent structures: in one case the L.M.S. railway has joined with T. Cook and Son and they have built a camp on the North Wales coast where rooms and conveniences can be rented at a rate that suits the manual worker who has not a great deal to spare for his sum</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">mer </span><span class="font12">vacation. As yet there is no record that any of the religionists want a church built for them, but undoubtedly they will soon be crying out that they are needed. The parsons are complaining that their people do not go to church when on holidays; no doubt getting away from the parson is part of the enjoyment.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark123"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark124"></a>National Register</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">• All the necessary machinery is ready for this, and in an emergency the work of compiling a national register can be started at a day’s notice. It is said that a complete staff of enumerators has been enrolled and local’Wu-thorities have been supplied with identity cards, to be issued when the Government </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">gives </span><span class="font12">the word. The registration will take the </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">same </span><span class="font12">form as the fuller census enumeration prepared for 1940, but with further </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">questionings.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark125"></a>Chaplains</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">• The various sections of religionists are </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">get</span><span class="font12">ting ready for the time when they will </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font12">called on to take their part in the military machine of this so-called “Christian” nation. The anti-God army of Russia, the greatest military power in Europe and therefore in ill the earth, does not find chaplains a necessity; nor do some other (ungodly!) nations itse them; but where religion is part of the State machine, as here in Britain, formal religion may not be left out of the national services, whether in peace or in war. The parsons see to it that they get a share in the service; and who is there to look to the spiritual needs of the men if the parson is not there, or help the stricken man to safety “on the other side” if there is no parson near?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The humbug in all this is rather nauseating. As a man joins the army he must have a religious tab. If he does not profess to be of the church of England, or of Rome, or a Methodist, he is made to parade with the Church of England and to its services he must go. </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font12">writer of a letter to a newspaper says well, “Now that militarism is debunked and shown up as the vile, murderous commercialized traffic in human life we all know it to be, it is time that all connection with religion should cease. A man can be doing bayonet drill or bombing one day, and the next, as </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">another </span><span class="font12">part of his military duties, be attending service in a Christian church—a degradation </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font12">an insult to the Founder of Christianity.” One parson is very angry at such suggestions and says, “It is high time that the churches refused to marry or </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">bury </span><span class="font12">civilians who </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">ex</span><span class="font12">pect the consolations of religion without its obligations.” He would compel every </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">unit in </span><span class="font12">the regiment to attend a “service” to listen to such as he. There is compulsion to join the army, and then compulsion to become a religionist at the time of the church services.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark126"></a>The Vatican and Franco</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">• The Manchester </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span><span class="font12"> says, “It is be-' lieved in Rome that General Franco has been keeping the Vatican specially informed oh </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font12">details of the new Constitution of </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Spam. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">. .Vatican </span><span class="font12">has been closely following the internal reorganization of Spain, in so far as this af</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">fects </span><span class="font12">the Church and Christian principles. -The pope is understood to have submitted the details of the new constitution to specialists ■in ecclesiastical law, requesting them to draw up a report on the way the constitution harmonizes with Catholic doctrine. It is believed that these observations have already been forwarded by the pope to General Franco.” Franco may claim that he has won Spain from the Red Terror, but the Hierarchy will see to it that it gets the bigger share of the “victory”. The late pope got very disturbed and seemingly excited when it was said he—and the Papacy—interfered in politics; but the hierarchy in Rome pursues the game openly as well as secretly.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark127"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark128"></a>Roman Catholics and Nazism</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">• In the House of Lords, Lord Marley, a member of the Labor party, in a discussion of Colonial matters, said, speaking particularly of the Rhodesias (Northern and Southern) , “In a school for native teachers I found books containing pictures of Berlin, and swastikas, and ‘Heil Hitler’, and the various irisignia of aggressiveness.” These, he said, “came from a German. Catholic mission.” The Roman Catholic missions in native Africa, like all other of their institutions, are under the direction of the Hierarchy, and this re-.port by Lord Marley is another proof of the Hierarchy’s association with Nazism and with Hitler, and of its pushing the propaganda of the Nazis.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark129"></a>Enemies of the Kingdom</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">♦. Religionists, particularly the Roman Catholic section, are very angry that the kingdom of God is being proclaimed by Jehovah’s witnesses, The whole claim of religionists is challenged by the truth; for they claim they are the Kingdom. Perverting the words of Jesus and of the apostles they claim that their church systems represent and are the kingdom of God of which Jesus spoke and the apostles wrote and spoke. These take the same position as that Taken by the Jews of Jesus’ day. His words were as an axe to the trees under which they ruled as in kingdom power; he destroyed their foundations. They assumed the right to rule as sitting in the seat of Moses, whom God appointed, arid of David, whom God raised to hc His(ruler in Israel. Jesus proclaimed the . kingdom of God came with IIim„ and in God’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">.. OCTOBER 4. 1939</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">time He would be manifested as its ruler. That the arrogant rulers in Jewry perceived the situation is clear from Jesus’ words in His parable; for He said of them that they said one to another, ‘This is the heir; let us kill him.’ This they did, and perished by its doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The fact of the return of the Lord for the full establishment of His kingdom and of its setting up, according to His word, is now proclaimed, and now, as then, the same class are found in deadly opposition to the message and its witnesses. It pleases the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to have its “fathers” speak evil of Judge Rutherford, who in a special way represents the message and the witnesses of Jehovah, and if they could they would undoubtedly crush him and the truth. In the pages of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font12"> Judge Rutherford has shown that religionists of all kinds are enemies of the kingdom of Grid. They have set for themselves the task of bringing the world under the rule of religion, professing that in seeking to get men to agree with them they are following the command Jesus gave to His disciples, that of preaching the gospel (of the Kingdom) to every creature. Their perversion of the words of Jesus has resulted in the same effect being produced as that of which Jesus said to the Pharisees—their converts were made two-fold more children of Gehenna than they themselves. The monstrous doctrines and practices of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy have produced some of the human monsters of history, and still fulfill the words of Jesus. The Hierarchy and its representatives realize the force of the proclamation of the kingdom of Christ; hence their vicious words against Judge Rutherford and their evil speaking against the proclamation.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark130"></a>Infidel Parsons</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">• That almost all the parsons and clergy of Protestant sects are non-believers in the Scriptures is one of the facts of the racket of religion. One of their number who bemoans this infidelity, but who docs not see that his only course for his safety is to come out from the unbelieving crowd and become a witness for the Kingdom, has got a cross-section inquiry showing what proportion of the preachers do not believe. His inquiry was of 500 representatives in the Baptist, Congregational, Methodist and English sections. He reports 46 percent do not believe in the Scriptural account of creation; 38 percent do not believe in the Revelation; 19 percent do not believe in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">29</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">virgin birth of Jesus; 27 percent do not believe in the second advent of the Lord; 55 percent believe the Bible contains myths and legends. These are some of those who reject the warning message now being given by Jehovah through His witnesses.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark131"></a>Roman Catholic Absurdities</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">• A Roman Catholic “father in God” in London announced a date on which, after morn<sub>7 </sub>ing mass, he would give his blessing on the dogs of the at tenders at his service. Women, some from hundreds of miles distant, brought their pets, and the priest, outside the building, sprinkled them with water, which lie called “holy water”; and he “blessed” the dogs, first in Latin, and then in English. One of the dogs, an Aberdeen terrier, howled disconsolately: it was said the dog had been “blessed” once before. As the women would be certain to “bless” their dogs afterwards, it may be presumed that on the whole they did not have a bad time. The Catholics have a “saint” “in heaven” —“St.” Roche—whose particular business it is to sec to the dogs of Catholics, and the day of this “service” was the “saint’s day” in their calendar. The Roman Catholics in England have not taken the use of the “saint” for some hundreds of years, but the dogs have missed nothing by the negligence of the “fathers”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Religionists of all sections badly want a revival of religion; for things go badly with them. The various noneomforming sections are free from much of the foolishness of the larger sections, but it is apparent that the biggest section, the Roman Catholic, will engage in absurdities in order to advertise their church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A woman member of that section, who says she is a practicing Catholic, lets it be known that she has for sale a genuine bit of the true cross, and will let it go for £100. She has a splinter of wood one-eighth inch long, carefully kept as a gem is kept, and with some proof that for some hundreds of years it has been considered authentic. If one did not know better jt would be a natural expectation that the very rich “church”, which sets so much store on its relics, would give the small sum to the woman rather than let a bit of the “cross” they so much revere get passed about as an ordinary salable thing. Will a priest buy it? Not he! All of them know that there are multitudes of splinters and pieces of wood in the church’s care, all held sacred or worshiped as parts of the true “cross”, and sufficient to make a earload. A priest will head a processioa which carries a skull or a bone, or </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">even $ </span><span class="font12">piece of the bone of a man or woman whoni te pope has beatified or made a “saint”, but thij priest who would put his own money in the relic business is far to seek: he knows better!</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark132"></a>Nun’s Cruelty to a Boy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">• The Bristol magistrates have dealt with </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">case of shocking cruelty by a nun in a “Nazareth” homo. The case was brought before the court by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. The evidence showed that tiie boy having angered her the nun banged his head against a door, beat him<sup>-</sup>severely, put him in a cold bath, threw five pails of cold vrater on him, then beat </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">him </span><span class="font12">again. The boy escaped and went to a relative. A doctor reported 29 weals on his back and chest and arms, and that he was in an undernourished condition. As there was no chance of rebutting the evidence, the nun pleaded guilty, and a lenient court bound her over to be of good behavior for twelve months. Judging from other eases the preventive Society brings before the courts it might have been expected that a sentence of imprisonment would be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It would not, of course, be proper to judge every “Nazareth” or “St. Joseph” Romain Catholic home for children as if this one were typical, nor every sister as being like this convicted nun, but it is fair comment to say that these homes for children ought to be open for inspection by competent and impartial persons in authority; and it would be a good thing if the representatives of the Society for prevention of cruelty should have access to them for inspection. This care of children is one </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font12">the set policies of the great .Hierarchy, and one may comment that it is policy rather than kindness and care that directs the homes; </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font12">the parades of the children under the guidance of sisters and nuns serves well for publicity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In Britain children are one of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">chief </span><span class="font12">hopes for the extension of the Roman Catholic church. It does not make many converts— not nearly enough to balance its losses. </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font12">Hierarchy, no doubt, grows in influence </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">in the  </span><span class="font12">high places of power: its system of scheming in official places, and of pulling political </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">wires, </span><span class="font12">gives them an advantage which they </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">use </span><span class="font12">successfully, always in the interests </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font12">“church”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">More cigarettes are now sold every week than were sold in the entire year of 1900, in which year some two billion were manufactured; now more than two billion, six hundred thousand are sold every week, or more than one hundred and thirty-eight billion a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Out of 300 boys brought before me charged with various crimes, 295 were cigarette smokers, charged with offenses all the way from shooting craps to burglary. Those who do not smoke seldom appear before me.-—Magistrate Leroy B. Crane, New York City.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Personally I have found every one of the many boy smokers I have talked to, a liar, an admitted liar. The whole tendency of the cigarette nicotine poison in youth is to arrest development. It is fatal to all normal functions. It blights and blasts both health and morals. The moral depravity which follows the cigarette is something frightful. Lying, cheating, impurity, loss of moral courage and manhood, are its general results.—Judge Ben Lindsay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The effect of tobacco upon the heart of some 100 medical students showed the average heart rate to be increased 8 beats per minute in smokers. This means an increase of 11,500 beats a day, which is a heavy strain upon the heart and may be the cause in later life of heart failure.—Dr. Reed O. Brigham, Toledo,' Ohio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Tobacco is a slow-acting insidious poison. The smoker does not. realize the danger he is in till the habit gets a grip on him and quitting is practically hopeless.—W. S. Hall, M.D.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As a physician of forty years’ practice, I give my decided opinion that tobacco has killed ten men where whisky has killed one. —Dr. Hammon, Baltimore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We positively know that tobacco causes heart disease, diseases of the nerves and mucous membrane, and that it diminishes the possibility of recovery from any disease.— Dr. Matthew Woods, Philadelphia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We refuse to receive tobacco users in our institution, because it is our experience in teaching more than five hundred thousand young people that cigarettes bring shattered nerves, mental weakness, stunted growth and general physical and moral degeneracy.— Spencerian Business College.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">GOVERNMENT AND PEACE</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A New Booklet by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">THE </span><span class="font12">SPIRIT OF INDEPENDENCE from </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">foreign power still lives! A few men, imbued with liberty, honesty, plain speech, and genuine public interest, still have the courage to stand forth and display that spirit which has kept democratic countries, until recently, free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Any who on June 25, 1939, heard directly at the world convention or by wire or radio the speech “Government and Peace” will, to be honest with himself, have to admit Judge Rutherford is, in deed and utterance, a type sorely needed in this time of peril.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">. Your true friend speaks frankly, without hypocrisy. In your interest he warns of lurking danger and boldly points out the stealthy enemy and their methods and activities which would deprive you at last of life, liberty, property and happiness. Judge Rutherford proves himself such a friend to you. With benefit you will prove it by reading his speech. More than 75 stations radiocast it from New York city. By beam and telephone line connections with New York simultaneous conventions in more than 30 cities in Great Britain, Canada, Hawaii, Australia, India and America heard it together.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark136"></a><span class="font17"><a name="bookmark137"></a>“THEOCRACY” TESTIMONY PERIOD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14">October 1 to 31</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">- greatest privilege ever extended to a creature is that of y 4 serving the Most High God. Jehovah, who is the Supreme \ Being of the universe, is the head of the Theocracy. Those . people who will attain salvation will fall in line with the rules and regulations of Jehovah's kingdom under the direction of Christ Jesus, His Son, and share in the magnifying of Jehovah’s name and word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">People of good will today are putting forth an earnest effort to make known throughout the entire earth the only hope for the world, and that hope is God’s kingdom. It is very fitting, therefore, that the month of October is set aside and called “THEOCRACY” TESTIMONY PERIOD, because during this period the book </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font0"> and the booklet </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace,</span><span class="font0"> which have much to say on the subject of ‘Theocracy’, will be distributed far and wide throughout the world by Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If you believe that this “strange work” now being carried on by a few people who love righteousness is right and proper, then you, too, will join in the proclamation of the Kingdom. There is no better time than right now to have a share in comforting those that mourn. In this distressed world there are many people of good will who need the comforting message contained in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace,</span><span class="font0"> which will be released for the first time world-wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The thing to do is to become associated with one of the companies of Jehovah’s witnesses and share in the proclamation of the Kingdom. Write the </span><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> Society for the name and address of its nearest company organization, and you will receive all details as to what to do during “THEOCRACY” TESTIMONY PERIOD.
