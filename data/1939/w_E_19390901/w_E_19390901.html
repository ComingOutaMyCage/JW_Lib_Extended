<p><span class="font7">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God's law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel: and it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.”—Acts 2:16,17.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9">JEHOVAH’S SPIRIT is the holy power of the I Most High by which he carries out his purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font9"> That holy spirit is invisible to human eyes, but God causes it to move his creatures on earth into action to serve his purpose. He gives a commission of authority to certain ones to do and to perform the things designated by that commission, and this he does by putting his spirit upon such creatures. At Acts the second chapter is the record of what took place at Pentecost, ten days after the ascension of Christ Jesus into heaven. There the apostle Peter, moved by the holy spirit, or invisible power of Jehovah God, quoted the prophecy of Joel, applying it in miniature at the time of Pentecost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>2</sup> The prophecy of Joel makes known something new and which never before was done by Jehovah toward those who should have to do with the carrying out of his purposes concerning the kingdom or theocratic government of the Most High. The record of Joel reads: “And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions.”—Joel 2: 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">’ The word there written “afterward”, or, literally, “afterward,” manifestly means that which follows after God’s people have done and performed the things stated at chapter two, verses 12-17, and which marks a fulfillment of the prophecy in completeness. Since the words of the prophecy must in due time apply to the remnant of God’s people in fulfillment, this clearly appears to be after the consecrated come to a knowledge that they had been negligent in serving Jehovah and, having greatly grieved thereat, they repented and turned themselves wholly and entirely to the pure worship of Jehovah God and to the service of his kingdom and refused further to be deterred in that faithful service because of fear of man or devil. That would mean, therefore, that the time was when Jehovah brought his people out of captiv-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">ity from the enemy and made them see their freedom in Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">* Because of yielding to religion the Jewish nation had forsaken the covenant with God and God had cast that nation away. Only a remnant of the Jews had stood firm to the terms of the covenant with Jehovah. Among such was Peter, the disciple of Jesus Christ, together with the other faithful disciples. The Scriptures disclose that this part of the prophecy of Joel had a miniature fulfillment at Pentecost, at which time God caused the disciples of Jesus to speak forth his purpose and to do so in many languages, which prior thereto they could not speak. The apostle Peter under inspiration there locates the time for the complete fulfillment of this part of Joel’s prophecy, and that time is named by the apostle as “the last days”. Other scriptures definitely show that “the last days” is the time of the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple for judgment (Mal. 3:1-3), and according to the Scriptural proof heretofore published in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> this appearing of the Lord at the time was in A.D. 1918. It was after that date that the consecrated ones repented and turned wholly to the service of Jehovah, as commanded by the prophecy recorded at Joel 2:12-17. The words of the apostle Peter make clear that the word “afterward” at Joel 2:28 applies specifically after A.D. 1918. At Pentecost the apostle said: “And it shall be in the last days, saith God, I will pour forth of my spirit upon all flesh : and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.”—Acts 2:17, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">A.ll.V.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>5</sup> Mark now the surrounding circumstances leading up to and obtaining at the time of the miniature fulfillment of the prophecy. Peter with an oath had three times denied his Master, Christ Jesus. All the other disciples had abandoned the Lord and fled in the night of his mock trial because of fear of the other Jews. All of them had much cause thereafter</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">for godly sorrow and certainly a reason to repent. (Matt. 26:55-75; John 18:15-27) Even after the resurrection of Jesus from the dead his disciples met behind closed doors because of “fear of the Jews”. (John 20:19-26) Afterwards those faithful disciples did show repentance and great sorrow, and Jesus forgave them and they were restored to God’s favor. (John 21:1-19) It was after they had been delivered from their fear of the Jews that the disciples were anointed with the holy spirit, as stated at Acts 2:1-14. Then the disciples became fearless and bold in declaring the name of Jehovah, his King and his kingdom. Ever thereafter they emphasized the importance of the kingdom. It was thereafter that God revealed to them his purpose to ‘take out a people for his name’ who should be witnesses to his name and majesty and power. (Acts 15:14) The disciples must be separated from religion and were so separated unto the Lord. At Pentecost God poured out his spirit upon all persons in the flesh who were then completely and wholly devoted to him. That was the miniature fulfillment of Joel’s prophecy above quoted.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>6</sup> In the years 1917 and 1918 (A.D.) there was a real test put upon the consecrated ones, and many of such failed to make a proper public confession of their devotion to God and to his kingdom; and that failure was due to fear. Because of such dereliction those consecrated ones were displeasing to the Lord. Therefore God’s favor could not be expressed toward the derelict ones until after they had repented and confessed to God and had set themselves wholly to do the will of God. Up to that time the consecrated held to the religious opinion that the chief purpose of Jehovah is to save men and take some of them to heaven and leave some on the earth, all of whom should assist God in carrying out his purpose. Although God’s people saw, in 1919, that the fear of man had ensnared them, they did not realize their really unhappy condition until 1922 or thereabouts. It was then that the Lord revealed to his people the truth of the presence of Christ Jesus at the temple and that God had used Isaiah the prophet to record a prophecy which had its fulfillment upon the consecrated in 1922, and which prophecy is, to wit: “In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips, for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts. Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar.”—Isa. 6:1,5, 6.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">’ Coming to a realization of their condition, and repenting and crying unto the Lord, it was then that the prophecy concerning the outpouring of the holy spirit began to have its fulfillment in completeness. Christ Jesus, then at the temple, acted for and in the name of Jehovah God to pour out His holy spirit upon the devoted ones whom he found approved at the temple judgment.—Acts 2: 33.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>8</sup> Later God’s people learned of his expressed purpose in ‘taking out from the nations a people for his name’. Long ago God had declared that he would permit the Devil to remain and carry on opposition to Jehovah for a period of a time fixed, at the end of which, God declared, he would cause his own great name to be proclaimed throughout the earth, and that this would be just preceding Armageddon, at which time he would exhibit his supreme power against the enemy. (Ex. 9:16) Those whom the Lord would send forth to be his witnesses to declare his name and his kingdom throughout the earth must therefore be anointed with his spirit and receive a commission from Jehovah and under that commission of authority do the work assigned to them. The terms of that commission God had set forth in his Word, disclosing that those in Christ Jesus, approved at the temple, would come fully within the class which should declare in the words of the prophet, to wit: “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord hath anointed me”; that is, God has commissioned me to carry forward his purpose due to be done and performed, and which must be done by those so taken out from the world for his name. Commissioned to do what? The prophecy answers : “To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance [vindication] of our God.” (Isa. 61:1, 2) Vengeance against whom? Against all who oppose the Theocratic government, and which enemies on earth chiefly are the religious leaders. Therefore the commission granted to the taken-out and anointed ones requires each one of them to proclaim the truth, which truth of God’s Word exposes religion as a snare of the Devil and as a racket practiced amongst men for material gain of the religion mongers. The time then arrived for God’s “strange work”, and the taken-out ones must participate in that “strange work” by declaring God’s purpose as announced in their foregoing commission. To do that work the witnesses must have the spirit of God upon them. Upon all such in the flesh devoted to Jehovah he poured out his spirit by and through Christ Jesus and thus made them his witnesses and sent them forth to proclaim his purpose.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>9</sup> The “strange work” of Jehovah means a destructive work toward religion and the advocates and practitioners of religion, because all such are in opposition to the Theocracy. Proclaiming God’s name and his kingdom works destruction upon such opposers of the Lord. God’s organization in general is symbolized by the name “Jerusalem”, which necessarily includes the kingdom. Note then the application of the prophecy from and after 1922, and which prophecy of Joel is corroborated by another prophecy of the Lord duly recorded: “And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek [cause] to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications; and they shall look upon me whom they [the enemy and opposers of God’s kingdom] have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourn-eth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.” —Zech. 12:9,10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>10</sup> Those who were devoted to God and his kingdom, and who were privileged to do the “Elijah work” prior to 1918, were pierced and the work was killed, and for that reason they did mourn. The name of Jehovah and of his beloved Son were pierced through by the enemy in 1918, and there was great mourning amongst the consecrated people of God, and this the Lord foretold by the prophecy of Zechariah above quoted. (See book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation,</span><span class="font9"> page 230.) Upon those faithful ones God poured out his spirit, which embraced all in the flesh who were thus devoted to Jehovah. This had its specific manifestation at Cedar Point convention on September 8, 1922. At that time a great burden was lifted from the hearts of those devoted to Jehovah and they discerned that there was much for them to do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>11</sup> Immediately following the anointing at Pentecost the apostles went forth preaching the kingdom to all who would hear, and their preaching was destructive of religion. The religionists opposed the apostles bitterly and heaped upon them great reproach. Saul of Tarsus had been a great religious leader and a persecutor of the disciples of Jesus Christ, and when the Lord opened his understanding religion, so far as he was concerned, was destroyed. (Gal. 1:1-14) Likewise immediately following the pouring out of the holy spirit on God’s devoted people in 1922 they were sent forth to declare the purposes of Jehovah, and the proclamation by them of God’s message was and since has been destructive to those who oppose the kingdom of God; and that destructive work will culminate when Jehovah’s &quot;strange act” at Armageddon is performed. All who received the anointing of the holy spirit and who acted upon God’s command were completely separated from the worldly organizations in which religion rules. Every one of the anointed, being commissioned by the Lord to act in his name, must proclaim his message of truth, which is destructive to religion. In order to receive the approval of God all such must faithfully perform the terms of the commission and therefore make themselves the objects of reproach, hatred, and persecution by the enemy. Anointed and performing their duty as commissioned, and being in Christ Jesus, such anointed ones are “the feet” of Christ, joyfully carrying out God’s purpose to make known his kingdom. (Isa. 52:7) As Christ Jesus the Head suffered great reproach and persecution at the hands of religionists, even so now “the feet of Him” are subjected to like persecution.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>12</sup> The witnesses of Jehovah are not moved by the influence of any earthly person. They have no earthly leader or earthly king. They are the servants of Jehovah God by and through Christ Jesus, and Christ is their Head and King. The words of Jehovah, as recorded in the prophecy, are: “I will pour out my spirit”; that is to say, God’s holy power, upon all devoted to him to do the work of proclaiming his message to the nations. The pouring out of his spirit is first upon the Head, Christ Jesus, and through him His spirit is poured out upon the members of his body. (Ps. 133:2) Christ Jesus is the Head and Leader of all of such, and no man can teach or lead such commissioned ones. They are all one, led and taught by their Head: “But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.” “But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you; but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.”—1 John 2: 20, 27.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ALL FLESH</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>18</sup> What, then, is meant by the words of the prophecy, “upon all flesh”? Surely not, upon all the world of mankind, as has been stated by some in the past. When Jesus was present in the flesh God poured out his spirit upon Christ Jesus. (Matt. 3:16,17) The holy spirit could not be poured out upon others until after Jesus was glorified. (John 7:39) The disciples had the promise of the holy spirit, and at Pentecost the holy spirit was poured out upon all the faithful disciples and others of the faithful ones then present who heard and believed and devoted themselves to Jehovah. (Acts 2: 38) Next thereafter the holy spirit was poured out upon the Samaritans who had wholly devoted themselves to God and to his kingdom. (Acts 8:14-17) Later and in God’s appointed time his spirit was poured out upon non-Jews in the flesh who had devoted themselves to Jehovah and his kingdom. (Acts 10:44-46) The terms “upon all flesh” certainly could not apply to anyone who opposes God and his kingdom. Manifestly the meaning of the words “upon all flesh” is that God’s spirit is put upon all creatures who are in a fleshly organism and who have been begotten of God’s spirit after fully devoting themselves to him and showing their full faith and devotion to God and to his kingdom. When Christ Jesus came to the temple in 1918 he there began the trial testing and judgment of the consecrated ones. Those who passed that fiery test, proving their unselfish devotion to the Lord and his kingdom, received the Lord’s approval, and were brought into the temple and anointed by the spirit of Jehovah God being poured out upon all of them, and this while they are in the fleshly organism. Thus being brought into Christ and made a part of his organization, they were sent forth thereafter to “offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness” acceptable unto him, and this they do, as stated by the Scriptures, by declaring God’s name and his kingdom.—Mal. 3:1-3; Heb. 13:15.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">RESULT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>14</sup> What is the result from the outpouring of the holy spirit? This question is answered in the prophecy : “And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy.” At Pentecost those words applied to the Jews, their sons and daughters, who had devoted themselves to God and his kingdom, because Peter, as well as the prophet Joel, addresses the message to “ye children of Zion”; “Israel . . . my people.” (Joel 2:23-27) The reference would therefore be to the antitypical Israelites at the time of the fulfillment in completion of the prophecy. Sons and daughters come after the parents, and therefore would picture the later or final ones forming God’s remnant, which are by the Lord brought into and made a part of “his faithful and wise servant” and to whom the Lord commits his kingdom interests on the earth. Being children, they would picture a young, vigorous group, keen of mind, unselfish of heart, and actively pushing forward in the performance of their covenant and commission from the Lord. (Isa. 44:1-8) Further concerning them the prophecy says: “And they shall prophesy”; meaning, they shall preach the truth. The apostles in their day did thus prophesy. All the other anointed ones prophesied; that is to say, they preached or proclaimed God’s message relating to the future, as well as to the present time, and all did so under the power of the spirit of Jehovah. As it is written in prophecy: “Jehovah hath spoken; who [that is devoted to him] can but prophesy?” (Amos 3:8, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font9"> The effect is that all such serve as witnesses for Jehovah by keeping his commandments, publishing his name and his kingdom according to the terms of the commission given, and thus they prophesy or proclaim the name and kingdom of the Most High. After the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple and the building up of Zion all who are taken into the temple and who remain faithful must bear testimony to the name and kingdom of Jehovah. “And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the Lord. As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the Lord: My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed’s seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.”— Isa. 59: 20, 21.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">CONTRAST</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>15</sup> The effect of that temple judgment was exactly contrary towards others, as the prophecy states: “Your old men shall dream dreams.” That would mean that the dreamers are not obeying God’s command. Such persons designated as “old men” have hard, fixed and closed minds and are therefore not teachable. Such persons conclude, and did conclude, as the facts show, that all of God’s truth was revealed through one man prior to October, 191G, and hence they refused to consider the revelation of God’s prophecy thereafter coming to those who serve him. Such “old men” retired from service in the field, took their ease and dozed and dreamed of the time when they might go to heaven and help administer the affairs there. They think more highly of themselves than they should think. All persons consecrated and who showed such a dreaming disposition at the time of the temple judgment were rejected by the Lord, as the prophecy shows, and all such persons as since then have been highly impressed with their own learning and greatness, and who have insisted on going their own way, have found themselves in the same class of the dreamers. That would mean that some who did receive the anointing, and who would not vigorously put forth an effort to fulfill their commission, will be relegated to the ‘dreamer’ class. The dreamers are in exact contrast with the “sons” and “daughters”. Such dreamers are great in their own estimation, and concerning such it is written: “Great men are not always wise; neither do the aged understand judgment.” (Job 32:9) The dreamers, not willing to learn of God, set about to proclaim their own ideas, and follow their own way and become prophets of deceit; that is, they deceive themselves and deceive others who give heed to their oft-repeated dreams. They never get away from their religious habits, and they hold on to the traditions of men. Concerning such the Lord has said: “They are prophets [proclaimers] of the deceit of their own heart; which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams, which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.”—Jer. 23: 26, 27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>16</sup> Then the Lord draws a clear contrast between the dreamer and those who are guided by his Word, when he says: “The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the chaff [dreams are here likened unto worthless chaff] to the wheat [God’s life-sustaining Word]? saith the Lord.” “Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the Lord, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them; therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the Lord.”—Jer. 23:28, 32.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>12</sup> In view of these plain words of God’s prophet let the anointed beware of and avoid the self-constituted wise men who think to exalt themselves by putting forth their own ideas or the traditional ideas of other men and who follow such and attempt to induce others to follow such dreamers.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">STRONG</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>18</sup> Those who really are devoted to God and his kingdom are by the prophet likened unto young men, to wit: “Your young men shall see visions.” Such are “strong in the Lord, and in the power [spirit] of his might”. (Eph. 6:10) Furthermore it is written: ‘The glory of the young man is his strength.’ (Prov. 20: 29) The visions which such young men have are not delusions, but a keen insight into and an appreciation of God’s Word. They discern the fulfillment of his prophecy and see that through Christ Jesus the prophecies are being unfolded, Christ Jesus the Head of the temple being the immediate Teacher of the members of his body. To such the apostle speaks, and prays, at Ephesians 1:17,18. Such young men see wonders, and have seen wondrous things in these “last days”, the meaning of which is revealed by the physical facts in fulfillment of prophecy, which the Lord has brought to pass. After being thus anointed they discern the kingdom and that Christ Jesus is at the temple carrying forward his Father’s purposes. They see and keenly appreciate the prophetic dramas long ago made and recorded by the Lord, foretelling the promotion of the kingdom interest and disclosing what is shortly to follow. In all of this they give glory to Jehovah God and to the King and take no credit to themselves.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>10</sup> The language of the prophecy of Joel makes it clear and certain that all who receive the outpouring of the holy spirit and who continue to abide thereunder must be active in the service of God. Those upon whom the spirit of God is poured out through Christ Jesus are members of “the body of Christ”. (1 Cor. 12:27) Is there a possibility of such losing that anointing and falling away? The Lord Jesus says: “If a man abide not in me, he is cast [away].” (John 15:6) Those who fail or refuse to bear the fruits of the kingdom, that is, to proclaim to others the life-sustaining truths of the kingdom, could not abide in the Lord; and concerning which Jesus said: “Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.”—John 15:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>80</sup> Surely this means that one might pass the test, enter the temple and receive the anointing, and then fail to carry out his commission, and fall and be cast away. In this connection note the words of Joel’s prophecy: “And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.” (Joel 2: 29) Peter, in quoting those words, said, as will be noted: “On </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">my</span><span class="font9"> servants and on </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">my</span><span class="font9"> handmaidens.” (Acts 2:18) The prophecy does not say: “Upon your servants and handmaids.” Clearly the purpose of the outpouring of the holy spirit is that those receiving it must be the servants of the Lord; which means they must serve him. Such must not be eye-servants to be seen of men, nor “men-pleasers”, but, “as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.” (Eph. 6:6) “As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.”—1 Pet. 2:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>21</sup> Undoubtedly this means that while some are assigned to some place of service, and some to another, each one must render service unto the Lord, and not unto men. Previous condition as to worldly position, education or reputation would make no difference, because all the anointed ones of the Lord are commissioned to render service to the glory of Almighty God and to his kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>22</sup> Note further the forceful words of the prophecy quoted by Peter: “I will pour out, in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">those days,</span><span class="font9"> of my spirit”; that is to say, after the coming of the Lord to the temple in 1918. This adds further proof that the pouring out of the spirit “upon all flesh” means that all creatures in the flesh who are devoted to Jehovah God receive the holy spirit and must thereafter be servants of God and faithfully continue to be such servants even to the end, and that all such collectively constitute the ‘elect servant’ or “faithful and wise servant”, to whom the Lord commits his kingdom interests on the earth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WONDERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>23</sup> The pouring out of the holy spirit prepared and equipped those servants to begin to carry on their work as servants and witnesses of Jehovah, and further shows that those who faithfully fulfill their commission by the grace of God would have a part in the wondrous things described, to wit: “And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.”—Joel 2: 30.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>24</sup> The anointed faithful ones themselves are wonders to many. Multitudes wondered at the apostles and others who received the holy spirit at Pentecost. (Acts 2: 6-13) Says the Psalm, referring to the faithful ones of God: “I am as a wonder unto many: but thou art my strong refuge.” (Ps. 71:7) “Behold, I [Christ Jesus], and the children whom the Lord hath given me, are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Zion.” (Isa. 8:18) “Hear now, 0 Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows that sit before thee; for they are men wondered at; for behold, I will bring forth my servant, The BRANCH.” (Zech. 3: 8) (See also Ezekiel 12: 6,11; Ezekiel 24: 24-27.) Jehovah’s witnesses today under the Greater Moses, Christ Jesus, fulfilled the picture of the wonders performed by Moses and Aaron in Egypt. (Ex. 4:21; 7: 3-9; Deut. 4: 34; 6: 22) His witnesses in these latter days have been used by Jehovah in fulfillment of some of his wonderful prophetic dramas. Jehovah’s “strange work” on earth now is a wonder to many, and God’s people have a part therein.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>25</sup> As to seeing “wonders in the heavens”, as stated by the prophecy (Joel 2:30), Jehovah has opened the eyes of understanding or discernment of the faithful servant class to see the two great signs or wonders in the heavens, which John saw in symbol. “And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars. And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.” (Rev. 12:1, 3) These signs or wonders are the great opposing organizations. The faithful servant class first began to see these “wonders in the heavens” in A.D. 1921, when </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> for the first time gave publication concerning the Devil’s organization. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">{The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> 1921, pages 90,91) Then in 1925 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> published the evidence showing that God’s people saw these wonders beginning to take place in 1914; and as to the wonders beginning to take place in 1914 and as to the “wonders ... in the earth” Jehovah has opened the understanding of his people to discern the earthly organization of the Devil, made up of religious, commercial and political elements, and has particularly pointed out the hideousness of the religious element. Also Jehovah shows his witnesses that he is using them in the earth, guiding them to do his work in having a part in pouring out the “seven last plagues” upon “Christendom” from and after 1922, and which plagues have tormented the enemy. These facts clearly fulfill the prophecy of Joel with reference to seeing wonders in the heavens and in the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>26</sup> Further describing conditions that would obtain at the end of the world, Jesus says: “There shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; [and] men’s hearts failing them for fear.” (Luke 21: 25, 26) The faithful servants of God not only have seen these wonders but have boldly declared the same to others. Further describing the things to be seen by the faithful ones as wonders, the prophet says: “Blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.” Poured-out blood is a symbol of death and that which is death-dealing. Such was foreshadowed when Moses poured out water in the land of Egypt and it became blood, and then he smote the waters of the Nile, which afterwards became bloody.—Ex. 4:9; 7:15-25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>27</sup> The meaning of that sign was revealed to Jehovah’s faithful servants through the publication of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> in 1934. Blood was also symbolized in the events that followed the blowing of The second trumpet’ (Rev. 8:8,9) and the outpouring of the vials of wrath of Almighty God. (Rev. 16: 3, 4) (See also </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font9"> Books One and Two.) Thus was revealed that the waters of religion and commerce are deathdealing when viewed in contrast with the waters of light and truth which proceed from Almighty God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>28</sup> Concerning “fire”, manifestly the fulfillment of this part of Joel’s prophecy is found in the fiery message of Jehovah God, which he has caused to be proclaimed throughout the earth, and particularly in the land of hypocritical “Christendom”. Jehovah’s witnesses, the faithful servant class, have been permitted to carry this fiery message among the people, and it has dreadfully scorched and burned the religionists : “Wherefore thus saith the Lord God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.” (Jer. 5:14) “Is not my word like as a fire? saith the Lord; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?” (Jer. 23: 29) Again Jehovah’s witnesses, pictured by “the man clothed with linen”, are commanded to go into God’s organization and take the fiery message and scatter it over the city or land of “Christendom”, which has a destructive effect upon religion. (Ezek. 10: 2, 7) That which followed the blowing of The first trumpet’ was like a fire, by means of which the religionists were scorched.—Rev. 8: 6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>29</sup> As to the “pillars of smoke” (Joel 2:30), those appear well to denote the “smoke of [the] torment” of the enemies of Jehovah, particularly of the leading religionists and their organization, and this because of God’s fiery message delivered amongst them. The Lord’s army of locusts have carried this fiery message amongst the religionists, and that fire has resulted in much smoke of torment to religious leaders. (Rev. 9:17,18) “The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.” (Rev. 14:10,11) The torment that Jehovah’s message brings to the religionists, particularly to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, increases daily in these “last days”, and this is shown by their repeated howls and cursings. They are so scorched and stunned that they incite mobs to assault Jehovah’s witnesses, thus showing their anger against God and against his kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>80</sup> Furthermore “pillars of smoke” arising denote the expression of God’s wrath against those who persecute his faithful servants; “There went up a smoke [in his wrath] out of his [Jehovah’s] nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured; coals were kindled by it. He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and thick darkness was under his feet.”—Ps. 18:8, 9, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.,</span><span class="font9"> margin.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>81</sup> Ever and anon in these “last days” God exhibits his wrath against his persecutors, but the complete expression of his wrath will be at Armageddon, and thereafter the smoke will ascend forever, denoting that the class consumed by the fire that made the smoke have ceased to exist for ever.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>82</sup> Following the outpouring of the holy spirit upon all flesh greater light was shed upon the anointed ones. Exactly the contrary came to the religionists and the “evil servant” class, and these found themselves in darkness: “The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the Lord come.”—Joel 2: 31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>88</sup> The sun is the work of God and is the source of light by day for his earthly creatures. Only God can turn that great light into darkness. God expresses his anger against the enemy by bringing darkness upon them. “I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil [calamity]. I the Lord do all these things.”—Isa. 45:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>84</sup> The plague of three days’ darkness which God brought upon Egypt pictures Satan’s agents of this day in darkness. (Ex. 10:21-23) God makes known his displeasure with the enemy in these words: “Let their way be dark and slippery [darkness and slipperiness </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(margin')'];</span><span class="font9"> and let the angel of the Lord persecute them.” (Ps. 35:6) “But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.”— Nahum 1:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>86</sup> The spirit of God gives light, and the light God withholds from those who hypocritically claim to be his servants but who in fact are the servants of the Devil. All religionists oppose God and his purpose, and hence they are in darkness. Specifically the Lord names the “evil servant” class, which class at one time was in the light but now is ‘cast into outer darkness’. (Matt. 24: 48-51) The kingdom light and truth, symbolized by the sun, God makes dark to the opposers, who have cast away his Word. All the physical facts show the fulfillment of this part of the prophecy in these latter days. Only those who have the spirit of the Lord see and appreciate the kingdom, and all the others, particularly the religionists, oppose the kingdom, and hence they are in complete darkness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>86</sup> The moon also is the handiwork of God, made to give light by night to his creatures. Turning the moon into blood could be done only by Almighty God, and such he does to show his displeasure toward his enemies. “The moon under [the] feet” of God’s “woman” is symbolic of his organization guided by his law. (Rev. 12:1) So Jehovah’s provision is that his organization shall be guided in the right way. Those who have the spirit of the Lord are guided by his light into paths of righteousness, and they delight to do his will. As to the enemy, they have no such light, but in darkness continue to oppose God. To the enemy the Scriptures are meaningless and are very dark. The present-day rulers of the earth get no aid or comfort whatsoever from the Bible. All the rulers hold to and practice some land of religion, and God's Word of light, which is his law, appears to the enemy as a dead and hideous thing, symbolized by congealed blood, and thus as to them the moon is turned into blood. The religious practitioners, particularly, and which includes the political leaders of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, hate the truth, because to them it speaks bloody vengeance and destruction. (Deut. 32:43; Matt. 23:34,35) To such enemy God’s King and kingdom are loathsome. Dictators look with horror upon God’s law, and hence the Hierarchy and other religious practitioners support the dictators and fight against the light of God’s Word, and bitterly oppose his kingdom. They do violence to those who bring his message of light and truth of the kingdom to the attention of the people. During the day of God’s “strange work” now in progress all things pertaining to the kingdom speak woe and death to the representatives of Satan’s agents on the earth. Here is further corroborative evidence that the day of Armageddon is near, because the darkness of the sun and the turning of the moon into blood, as shown by the prophecy, take place immediately “before the great and terrible day of Jehovah” coming. Since 1925 particularly Jehovah’s witnesses have carried the kingdom message and placed it within the hearing of the people, which message tells of the day of vengeance of our God, and that it is very near. Such is their part in God’s “strange work”, and such work appears to the religionists as a very strange thing. This witness work must be done before Jehovah shows to the enemy His great power, which he will do at Armageddon. Causing his name and his kingdom to be proclaimed throughout the earth, Jehovah thus gives warning to the enemy and at the same time extends his mercy toward those practitioners of religion who have been and are deceived and held as prisoners in the religious organizations, and who unwittingly have walked with religionists. Now in this day Jehovah makes it clearly to appear that religion is doomed, and the sounding of such warning of doom provides the opportunity to all persons of good will to flee to the kingdom for protection before the wrath of God is expressed against Satan’s organization.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WHO MAY ESCAPE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">” To now be permitted to declare the name and kingdom of Jehovah and the approaching hour of his wrath upon all wickedness, is an unspeakable privilege granted to those upon whom he has put his spirit. The message boldly announces the supremacy of Jehovah, and this done in the midst of religious opposition makes it possible for those who hear and who obey to find protection and salvation; and this God foretold through the prophecy of Joel 2:32: “And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the Lord hath said, and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>88</sup> Necessarily it follows that whosoever shall not call upon the name of the Lord shall not be delivered. That makes it imperative for Jehovah’s witnesses to carry out their commission to proclaim his name, his kingdom and his vengeance at the present time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>88</sup> When must one call upon the name of Jehovah, that deliverance may be had'? Not after the battle of Armageddon begins, at which time all may discern by the natural sight of the eyes the expression of God’s vengeance against wickedness. Faith must be exercised by those who find protection. One must first believe that the Almighty God is Jehovah and that protection and salvation belong to him. (Heb. 11: 6; Ps. 3:8) He must believe that Jesus Christ is the Redeemer and Deliverer, and then take action in harmony with that belief. Otherwise the inherited condemnation abides on such one to destruction. (John 3: 36) He must call upon the name of Jehovah before the battle of Armageddon begins; and this he must do by hearing, believing and acting upon the information of truth brought to him by those who are witnesses for Jehovah, and particularly upon whom God has placed his spirit. For this reason Jehovah sends forth his anointed witnesses to declare his name and his purposes: “How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher [one who bears testimony to the truth or proclaims the truth] ? And how shall they preach, except they be sent [which are sent by receiving the anointing of the spirit and commission from Jehovah to go and preach this gospel of the kingdom] ? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!” (Rom. 10:14,15) It is concerning these faithful witnesses that the prophecy is written: “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him [Christ] that bringeth good tidings, that pub-lisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!”—Isa. 52: 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>40</sup> It is now easy to be seen why the dictators demand that the people shall salute flags and hail men, and why the Roman Catholic Hierarchy join in such demands upon the people, and why they cause the legislative bodies to frame laws working mischief, and why the Roman Catholic Hierarchy demands that the people should hear nothing except what the Hierarchy tells them. The acts of the dictators and of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their other religious supporters are proof conclusive that such are the agents of Satan and are desperately attempting to turn the people away from Jehovah God and to prevent them from hearing of his name and his kingdom. The dictators and religionists have rejected Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s anointed King, the Ruler in the Theocracy. Every attempt is to turn the people away from the only possible means of protection and salvation. This is clearly shown by the Scriptures as well as the facts that have come to pass in recent years. Concerning the King it is written: “This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.”—Acts 4:11,12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>41</sup> The dictators and religionists are would-be builders of earthly governments and insist on ruling in the place and stead of God’s kingdom. They definitely reject Jehovah’s King and kingdom, and hence upon them Jehovah’s wrath will shortly be expressed. Those who remain with the religionists are certain to go down in that great catastrophe of Armageddon. Those who will find protection and salvation must hear the truth before Armageddon and must obey the Lord by fleeing from religion and religionists and diligently seek protection under Christ Jesus. The great Judge and Executioner of Jehovah is the Lord Jesus Christ, and he is the only One: “One only is the lawgiver and judge, even he who is able to save and to destroy.” (Jas. 4:12, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font9"> Let all who so desire to follow in the lead of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and dictators, and who desire to bow down to them and hail men and salute flags, follow their own desire, but let such be fully warned of this, that only those who show their faith in God and his King, and who obey God and his King by acting before Armageddon as Rahab did, will find deliverance.—Jas. 2: 24-26.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">** Organized religion began with Babylon, and ever since then the religionists and their organizations have been designated in the Scriptures under and by the name of “Babylon”. As God sent Jeremiah to warn those of Israel who were of good will that they might flee out of the Devil’s organization, so now he sends his anointed ones, accompanied by their companions, the Jonadabs, to give warning to all others who desire protection and salvation, and to those warned Jehovah now says: “Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul; be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the Lord’s vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence.” “My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the Lord.”—Jer. 51: 6, 45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>48</sup> This message must be carried to the people now, and upon every one who has received the anointing of the holy spirit God has placed the responsibility to participate in delivering that message. A failure or refusal to perform the commission thus given is certain to be disastrous to the ones thus failing or refusing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">** In the typical days Jerusalem and Zion were located on adjoining mountains, and pictured the universal and the capital organization of Jehovah. Zion was a type of Jehovah’s capital organization, made up of Jesus Christ and the 144,000 members of his body, anointed by the holy spirit, and upon which mountain, antitypically, now Jesus Christ and his body members stand, and there they are strongly fortified against the enemy. (Rev. 14:1,3) Those who will compose the “great multitude” are not pictured as standing upon Mount Zion. All persons of good will who flee to the mountains as commanded, and faithfully abide there under the protection of Christ until the end of Armageddon, will be delivered and will form the “great multitude”. “For in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance,” says the prophecy. Here the word “deliverance” means “an escaping”, and may be properly applied to the act of escaping and to those who do escape. (Isa. 4:3,4) Jehovah’s provision for those of good will is by and through Christ Jesus, the Head of his organization Zion. “But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.” (Obad. 17) Mount Zion is the Theocracy or Kingdom, and deliverance shall be there because Jehovah God will fight for his organization, as it is written: “For thus hath the Lord spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the Lord of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof. As birds flying, so will the Lord of hosts defend Jerusalem; defending also he will deliver it; and passing over [covering it with complete protection] he will preserve it.” (Isa. 31:4,5) Thus the Lord shows that protection and salvation come only from him by and through his royal organization. This he makes known for the benefit of the Jonadabs, or persons of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>45</sup> Escape and deliverance shall be found in no other place than in the Lord God’s organization, “as the Lord hath said.” Repeatedly God has thus said by his prophets, the “holy men of old”. He has said it through Christ Jesus and his apostles, and now he uses the remnant, or the anointed ones, to bring this message to the attention of the people of good will. All of these, from the faithful men of old, and including the remnant, have been and are witnesses to the name of Jehovah and his purpose. The remnant now bear this message which the Lord has said, and they must continue to carry that message to the people, because that is the purpose of their anointing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>40</sup> The prophecy of Joel 2: 32 shows that the remnant constitute a part of Jehovah’s organization and now represent it on the earth, particularly Jehovah’s capital organization Zion, concerning which it is written: “And in [(R.F.) among] the remnant whom the Lord [doth] call.” Furthermore this makes clear that those who do escape and find refuge must now hear the message of and concerning the kingdom, must believe it, and must seek the Lord, and must take their place among those of the remnant and become companions of the remnant in the service. This part of the text according to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font9"> says: “And among the survivors whom Jehovah doth call.” The survivors of the remnant, of course, must abide in the organization in order to find protection and salvation. The remnant Jehovah has called from all nations to be witnesses for his name, and upon such he has poured out his spirit. Prior to 1919 many of these were held in prison to the enemy organization, and the Lord called them out and sent them forth as his commissioned witnesses. These witnesses, in order to maintain their integrity, must be faithful in the performance of the commission which Jehovah has issued to them, and therefore they must give great diligence in proclaiming the name and purpose of Jehovah, the great Theocrat. Faithfulness in such performance of duty necessarily exposes religion and religionists, and for this reason great persecution is heaped upon Jehovah’s witnesses by the religionists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>47</sup> Furthermore for the encouragement, comfort and hope of those who have received the anointing of the holy spirit, and who therefore constitute the duly comrqissioned servants of Jehovah in these “last days”, they must keep in mind always this fact, that such anointed ones constitute God’s “locusts”, which he calls his “great army” (Joel 1: 4; 2:11, 25); and that these are sent into the field of warfare there to have part in “his work, his strange work”. Jehovah has pronounced his judgment of doom and everlasting destruction upon religion and religious practitioners. It follows that the religionists, particularly the leaders thereof, will fight Jehovah’s witnesses to the bitter end. The prophecy shows that many of the leaders will hide behind walls and induce their dupes to go forth and fight Jehovah’s witnesses. Nothing else should be expected than increasing opposition from the enemy from this time forward. Jehovah therefore says to his people that this will be true, and he also says that in this fight the enemy shall suffer complete defeat and destruction: “And they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.” (Jer. 1:19) It was in the year 1918 that the then faithful ones were gathered to the temple and received the outpouring of the holy spirit. Those who since that have been brought into the body of Christ have also received the outpouring or anointing of the holy spirit by and through Christ Jesus, the Head of Zion. Mordecai and Nacini pictured the first-mentioned class, while Esther and Ruth pictured the latter ones. All these together make up the &quot;faithful and wise servant” class, to whom the Lord Jesus has committed his kingdom interests on the earth. They must faithfully promote such kingdom interests at all times. Because of their faithfulness in performance of their duty in fulfillment of their commission they are the objects of reproach and persecution at the hands of the religionists. But let all of the anointed, together with their companions, now be of good courage as they study the remaining portion of the prophecy of Joel and discern God’s purpose to dispose of the enemy, and to give complete protection and salvation to those who love him.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark12"></a>ANIMAL SOULS ON EARTH BEFORE MAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font18">L</span><span class="font7">IFE on the earth begins! God’s fifth creative day or time-period had now opened. “The waters which were above the firmament” (according to Genesis 1:7) </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font7">in the form of an aqueous ring or watery rings surrounding the earth and “swaddling” the earth like a canopy (according to Job 38:9). Now they received the light from the sun, and this would produce a condition conducive to the existence of animal life upon the earth. The “spirit”, or invisible power, of the Almighty God now operated upon the “waters which were under the firmament” and which God called “seas”. This action caused these waters to bring forth abundantly moving, living creatures, such as fish and other creature life, and fowl that flew above the earth. Man, of course, had not yet appeared upon the earth, and did not appear until the close of the next, or sixth, creative time-period or “day”. But what was or is the classification of these active, moving, living things that were thus brought forth before man’s creation? Were they and are they soulless creatures, as scientists and religionists have long taught? Did a soul first inhabit the earth at man’s creation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The original language of the Bible, the Hebrew, is very clear in its answer to these questions. Because Rotherham’s </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Emphasized Old Testament</span><span class="font7"> is very faithful and accurate in its translation of the original sense and meaning of the original Hebrew text of the Bible, the following quotation from the Bible is according to Rotherham’s version (Genesis 1: 20-23) :</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“And God said, Let the waters swarm [with] an abundance of living soul, and birds shall fly over the earth, over the face of the expanse of the heavens. And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living soul that moveth, [with] which the waters swarmed after their kind, and every winged bird, after its kind. And God saw that it was good. And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds multiply in the land. So it was evening, and it was morning, a fifth day.”—See also the marginal notes in Auth. Ver. Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During this fifth creative period God caused to come into the waters great swarms of living souls (Hebrew text: </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">nephesh chayyah),</span><span class="font7"> to wit, whales, reptiles and creatures which could live out on land or in water, also shellfish and like creatures. Geologists have discovered that there are immense beds of limestone in various parts of the earth wherein are great quantities of shells of fish, and these are called “shellfish cemeteries”. This would support the conclusion that after the beginning of this fifth creative day there was a falling of one or more of the canopy rings near the north and south poles of the earth, and an inrushing of snow and ice which swept to the earth’s equator and destroyed great quantities of these living creatures; and afterwards the way was opened for the creation and bringing forth of other living creatures or souls (Hebrew: </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">nephesh chayyah).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With the opening of the sixth creative period or day the dry land had been separated from the waters on the earth for a period of approximately twenty thousand years. The earth’s surface was cool by this time. It produced grass and herbs and fruit, this having begun on the third creative day. (Gen. 1:11-13) These, together with the climatic conditions, were suitable for animal life. The Scriptural account concerning this creative period reads, according to Rotherham’s accurate translation of the original Hebrew text: “And God said, Let the land bring forth living soul </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[nephesh chayyah]</span><span class="font7"> after its kind, tame-beast and erecping thing and wild-beast of the land after its kind. And it was so. And God made the wild-beast of the land after its kind, and the tame-beast after its kind, and every creeping thing of the ground after its kind. And God saw that it was good.”— Gen. 1: 24, 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Beasts of the earth have not always been the same. At one time there were upon the earth great numbers of mammoth animals, some of them measuring eighty feet in length. Proof of this is now found in skeletons digged from great depths in the earth. Great numbers of these mammoths roamed the earth. Some have been found frozen in the ice and snow, while skeletons of others have been digged from the beds of earth and stone in the tropical regions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The reasonable conclusion is that each one of the ages or creative periods, of 7,000 years each, ended with a great catastrophe, caused by the breaking and falling at the poles of one of the aqueous or watery rings. This, in turn, permitted the inrushing of great bodies of water and ice and snow which swept away the animal and plant life and rendered desolate the earth. In the course of time other animals and plants took their places on the earth. Different kinds of animals appeared at different stages of the animal creative period. During these periods a hothouse condition existed on the earth, due to the translucent aqueous rings above the firmament and surrounding the earth. This hothouse condition was thus destroyed by snow and ice at times; and this is proved by the physical facts found on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When it is considered that each one of these creative days or periods was of seven thousand years’ duration, it can be understood how one kind of animal appeared and perished, to be succeeded by another kind and within the same creative day. In due season God created the cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps upon the earth, including all the domestic animals, some of which kind are still on the earth. Each one had come in its due time according to the divine will, each kind had its function to perform, and all were necessarily important in the creative work of Jehovah relative to the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The time came for the creation of the intelligent creature man. It seems certain that Jehovah held conversation with his beloved One, his only begotten Son, the Logos or Word of God, concerning His purpose of creating man. Again quoting the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font7"> translation, the inspired record reads: “And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the bird of the heavens, and over the tame-beast, and over all the land, and over every creeping thing, that creepeth on the land. And God created the man in his own image, in the image of God created he him, male and female created he them.” God then issued to the perfect man and woman His divine mandate: “And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the bird of the heavens, and over every living thing that moveth on the land. And God said, Lo! I have given to you every herb yielding seed which is on the face of all the land, and every tree wherein is the fruit of a tree yielding seed, to you shall it be for food; and to every living thing of the land, and to every bird of the heavens and to every thing that moveth on the land, wherein is a living soul </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[nephesh chayyah;</span><span class="font7"> however, not separate and distinct from the animal’s body and able to escape from the animal’s body at death and thereafter live somewhere outside the animal’s body], every green herb for food. And it was so. And God saw every thing which he had made, and lo! it was very good. So it was evening, and it was morning, the sixth day.”—Gen. 1: 26-31; see also marginal note, Auth. Ver. Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah furnished the specifications for the building of the first man. Marvelous wisdom is displayed in those specifications. Provision was made for the exact number of bones, to wit, two hundred and six, to form the human skeleton. A perfect system of circulation of the blood was provided. Provision was made for the lungs to keep the blood pure, and a heart to keep up the circulation; and the most marvelous electrical system, which we call “nerves”, was provided for. All the minute details were carefully worked out, even to the numbering of the hairs of the head. —Matt. 10:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then Jehovah’s only begotten Son, the Logos, or Word, proceeded to build man exactly according to these specifications. (John 1:1-3) It is written that the man is of the earth and earthy. (1 Cor. 15:47) This is true because he was made out of the elements that form the earth. For this reason the earth contains every element that goes to make up a perfect human organism. The process employed in the creation of man is stated thus, according to the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham </span><span class="font7">translation: “So then Jehovah God formed man [of the] dust of the ground, and breathed in his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[nephesh chayyah].” </span><span class="font7">—Gen. 2:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The animals created prior to the creation of man were also designated “souls”, because every creature that breathes is a soul. There is no intimation in the record that God made man and then </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">gave</span><span class="font7"> him a soul, and an immortal one at that. God formed him, and then into the nostrils of that organism God breathed the breath which he has provided for all living creatures, and a soul resulted: “man became a living soul.” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Soul</span><span class="font7"> means a breathing, sentient creature having life. Thus it is seen and Scripturally proved that animal souls preceded man’s appearance on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Could it be said that, because God is immortal and man was made in His image and likeness, therefore God gave man an immortal soul? Such conclusion is both unreasonable and unscriptural. If God gave man a soul, then the Record would state so; and if that soul so given were immortal, then God could never put it to death for a violation of his law. That would mean then that when God would start a life he would have no power to stop it; and this idea is not consistent with his limitless power. Furthermore, it is written that “[God] only hath immortality”. (See 1 Timothy 6:16.) From the fact that God is the life-giver, it follows that he has the power to take away life at his pleasure. The Scriptures show that he reserved to himself the right to deprive his creature of life; therefore it is conclusively proved that man is mortal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Is not the breath (Hebrew text: </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">neshamah'),</span><span class="font7"> which God breathed into the nostrils of man, the so-called “divine or immortal spark” of man which God planted in man? The answer to that must be, No, for the reason that the Scriptures show that God did nothing of the kind; but that he made man of the elements of the earth, and when the breath of life was put into man’s nostrils a moving, breathing creature resulted, which creature is a soul. The breath which man breathes belongs to Jehovah, because everything is God’s. The right to life proceeded from God. The “breath” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(neshamah')</span><span class="font7"> is not immortal. The breath itself possesses no life. The breath is that which keeps the blood in circulation by which the human body is animated. The Scriptures plainly state that the life is in the blood. (Deut. 12:23) Man is the highest order of animal creation. All animals, including man, have the same kind of breath. (Eccl. 3:19) Human experience conclusively shows that man dies, and any creature that dies is not immortal. A creature to be immortal would necessarily be not subject to death. God was pleased with his work in the creation of man the “living soul”, and pronounced that work “very good”. Man was the earthly son of the great Jehovah God, and God loved him. The environment he made for man’s happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A portion of the earth, which was called Eden, God had caused to be brought to a perfect condition. It must have been a beautiful place. The man whom he had made for it, and to have dominion over it, was perfect; and his home also was made perfect, because all the works of Jehovah are perfect. (Deut. 32:4) In the eastern part of Eden God planted a garden which was a veritable paradise. Trees that brought forth marvelously beautiful flowers were there to please the sight of man with their blossoms, and to perfume the air that he breathed. Other trees that bore all manner of fruit were there, and from these man had provided for him his food supply. There were found numerous birds with marvelous plumage, the bird of paradise and the bird of song. Every kind of beast was there, but they were not wild. These beasts were gentle, tame and obedient. They walked before Adam, their master, who gave each one of them a name; and they heard his voice and responded thereto. The divine record of this reads, according to the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font7"> translation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Now Jehovah God had formed from the ground every living thing of the field, and every bird of the heavens, which he brought in unto the man, that he might see what he should call it, and whatsoever the man should call it, any living soul </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[nephesh chayyah],</span><span class="font7"> that should be the name thereof. So the man gave names to all the tame-beasts, and to the birds of the heavens, and to all the wild-beasts of the field, but for man had there not been found a helper as his counterpart.”—Gen. 2:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Eden’s garden or paradise the climatic conditions were perfect, and a sweet perfume floated through the zephyrs, which were at the same time filled with song and praise to the glory of Jehovah God. Created with perfect veneration, man must worship his glorious Maker.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark14"></a>HOW MANY GET TO HEAVEN?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font7">HE WORLD is composed of heaven and earth. “Heaven” has reference to the things not seen with the natural eye. “Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” (2 Pet. 3:13) The new heaven and new earth constitute the world of righteousness. That new heaven is Jehovah God’s capital organization, named Zion, of which Christ Jesus is the Head. That organization is composed of 144,000 associate members together with Christ Jesus who share with him in his riehes and glory, and it is supported and accompanied by a host of holy angels attending upon the Lord Jesus.—Matt. 25: 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The 144,000 associate members of that capital organization are spiritual Israelites and taken from among men. (See The Revelation 7:4-8; 14:1-4.) These human creatures are first given a knowledge of the truth, then separated from those of the world, put through a test, tried, and approved by Jehovah God. All this work is done by Christ Jesus, the great High Priest of Jehovah. Christ Jesus was himself first chosen, then tried and fully proved, and, showing his faithfulness in maintaining his integrity toward God till death, he was then exalted to the highest position in Jehovah’s universe. After his resurrection and his ascension on high Christ Jesus begins the selection of the associate members that shall be in his organization, and this continues until it is accomplished at the “end of the world”, Satan’s world. The holy and royal capital organization of Jehovah will always be invisible to human eyes, because Christ Jesus is a divine spirit and the members of Jehovah’s royal house are spirit creatures, and no human eye can see a spirit creature as such. This royal house constitutes the new heavens, of which the apostle Peter speaks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The entire period of time from Pentecost of A.D. 33 until the coming of Christ and his kingdom is occupied in the selection of those who will be associated with him in his kingdom. It is the 144,000 that are selected to be made members of the royal house. Are these selected merely to get them into heaven ? No; they arc taken out from among the peoples of the nations of earth to be witnesses among men to the name of Jehovah and to his kingdom. Concerning this it is written: “God at the first did visit the Gentiles [the nations], to take out of them a people for his name.” (Acts 15:14) While on the earth these selected ones, begotten of Jehovah’s spirit, must show forth the praises of Jehovah God and his King Christ Jesus, and for that purpose they are called out of darkness and given the light of God’s Word. (See 1 Peter 2: 9.) Many have been led to believe that God has caused the Kingdom gospel to be preached merely to save men from eternal punishment in fire and brimstone and to give them a home in heaven. That is not God’s purpose, as His Word clearly shows. The company of persons so taken out from among the nations for Jehovah’s name are the elect company of God, all of whom must be put to a certain test and must perform certain specific duties while on the earth.—Rom. 8: 16-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the period of approximately 1,900 years Jehovah has been calling, instructing and selecting those who make up his royal house, of which Christ Jesus is the Head and Lord. (Heb. 3:1-6) Faithfulness unto death is required of all who are thus brought into His royal family. Millions of persons have been led to believe that they are Christians, and claim to be followers of Christ, almost all of whom have never even learned what is required of a follower of Christ. The Scriptures definitely show that the number of the royal house of Zion is limited to 144,000. Christ Jesus is the Lord of lords and King of kings, and “they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful”. (Rev. 17:14; also 7:4; 14:1-4) Those who enter into a covenant of consecration to do the will of God and who are invited into the covenant for the kingdom of heaven and who joyfully prove their faithfulness unto death are permitted to share the heavenly riches as joint-heirs with Christ.—Rev. 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The 144,000 members of the royal house are the only ones taken from among men who find their everlasting abiding place in the invisible spirit realm of Jehovah God, and concerning these it is written: “Beloved, now are we the sons of God; and it doth not yet appear what we shall be [in heaven] ; but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.”—1 John 3: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Does that mean that none aside from the 144,000 will ever be the possessors of riches which are bestowed by Jehovah? No, such is not the teaching of God’s Word. The 144,000 spirit creatures constitute the royal house, which company shares with Christ Jesus in his kingdom. To Christ’s twelve apostles, representing all the faithful disciples, the promise is made: “And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.” “And you are they who have continued with me in my trials. And I covenant for you, even as my Father has covenanted for me, a Kingdom, that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.” (Matt. 19:28; Luke 22:28-30, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott</span><span class="font7"> version) This proves that there must be and will be a regeneration, including the regeneration of the obedient ones of mankind who will never go to heaven but will abide for ever on the earth perfected, and in this work of regeneration of men of good will the 144,000 shall share with Christ Jesus, “The Everlasting Father,” they serving under his direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Does one have to go to heaven in order to lay up “treasures in heaven” (Matt. 6:19-21) ? No. A person may lay such up even though he remains on earth for ever and does not go to heaven. All riches of treasures proceed from heaven, and riches from such treasure house result to those who receive a knowledge of God’s purposes, as stated in his Word, and who then are diligent in their endeavors to do God’s will. Jehovah is the source of riches, and Christ Jesus the dispenser thereof. The riches that obedient men shall receive on earth come from heaven.—Jas. 1:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH’S PROVISION</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah has graciously blessed his people in the provision of the new book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font7"> and we wish to tell you of our deep gratitude to our loving Father for the gift copy which we have all received. Your thoughtfulness in making this possible is but one of the many provisions which you have made in caring for our spiritual and physical welfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We would like to tell of our joy in learning of Jehovah’s provision for the salvation of those who love him, and the particular appeal of the subtitle “A text-book for the Jonadabs”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During recent months the nations around us have been sorely perplexed and in dire distress anxiously looking with fear to what the future may hold. In contrast, our privilege to be taught of Jehovah under his Theocratic Government has been a source of joy and thankfulness; for w’e know that Jehovah will protect those who serve him. The seven chapters of the book are thrilling, and an appreciation of this great emergency and the need of salvation TO life which must be found by the great multitude through God’s provision of the ransom, if they are willing to meet His requirements and serve under God’s government, has greatly thrilled us to use our all in proclaiming the Kingdom message so that the “other sheep” may enjoy the wonderful privileges extended to obedient men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We would like to add just a word of our appreciation of the great International Watchtower Convention. It was indeed a privilege to share with our brethren in receiving the strengthening instruction and encouragement of your Saturday broadcast, “Victory,” and to know that Jehovah is now so shortly to command his people to complete their work in victory. It was wonderful to share in the united release of the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.</span><span class="font7"> On Sunday it was a joy to declare ourselves wholeheartedly on the side of God's “Government and Peace”, a message of vital necessity to all of good will in these last days. The reception was marvelous, by the Lord’s direction, and a mighty witness to the honor of Jehovah’s name was given to the many thousands who packed out the British auditoriums.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are indeed happy to record the joy of our service in Bethel, and we are determined, by the Lord’s grace, to take our position in the front against the devilish forces of wickedness now seeking to destroy God’s faithful servants. We realize that the fight is on, and we earnestly pray that Jehovah may continue to richly bless and sustain you, and our desire is to follow your fearless lead as set by Jehovah’s King, Christ Jesus. Our prayers are on behalf of all our brethren laboring with you, and we look forward to the speedy annihilation of the Devil and his crowd of racketeers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We all unite in sending you our w'arm love and gratitude.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW SHUT-INS ARE WITNESSING</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;As in the northern part of this priest-ridden country, so with the southern islands, the priests of the Hierarchy have been trying to follow our pioneers from house to house, inducing the people to burn the books if they had taken any. Yes, they are getting so low in their activities, and, so doing, they do more good than harm to the Lord’s work. Their evil works have advertised the publication of the Kingdom message. Even the uninterested are beginning to investigate what they call ‘unusual’, and there are those who want to learn what it is that aroused the ire of ‘father’ So-and-so. Strange work indeed. In some places where the Kingdom has been proclaimed, the truth that religion is a racket is now becoming common knowledge. An incident will illustrate : A pioneer on his way to his territory was invited to come to an office of a certain rubber company. Much to his surprise he was requested to read an advertisement written on the office bulletin board, that ‘Religion is a racket and is of the Devil’. This happened the day after a long discussion occurred between a publisher and a Protestant pastor, where the truth badly exposed the ‘reverend’ to ridicule and contempt. Some government officials who were present not only expressed their gratitude and appreciation in learning the truth, but provided themselves with books and subscribed for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font7"> which the publisher offered them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">LIKE RAHAB ROUNDING UP HER RELATIVES</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;We went to Nebraska mainly to give our relatives and friends a witness. We knew four of them were in the truth long enough to go out in the service work. After we got there, we found all of their married children were interested in the truth. We played the three lectures ‘Face the Facts’, ‘Fascism or Freedom,’ and ‘Fill the Earth’ over and over again. They liked the lectures so well they just couldn’t hear enough of them. After witnessing to twenty of our relatives’ families we found they all had been reading the literature, and some of them were ready for service. In two weeks, the result of these twenty families is as follows: 8 new Kingdom publishers; placed with them (and coming and going on our trip) 21 bound books, 273 booklets; 49 hours, 176 sound attendance, 13 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> subscriptions, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font7"> subscription, 15 back-calls, 26 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font7">Copies and 36 sample </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> copies. When we left, they were going to have their first new </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study, with 26 new attendance. We also placed 3 Bibles, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book.</span><span class="font7"> Ten more of this phonograph attendance have stated they will go out in the service as soon as they have studied their </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower</span><span class="font7"> a little more. We thank our great Creator, Jehovah God, for giving us that wonderful privilege of serving him, guiding us all the way.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WHEN MISTAKEN FOR A RELIGIONIST—</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Being turned away at the door by a woman, I saw a man at the barn. Immediately after greeting him and explaining my work I was ordered rudely off the farm. Thinking the man had sized me up wrong I paused and stated: ‘From the feeling expressed in your voice I take it you are fed up with religion’; and received the reply: ‘You d----</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">right I am.’ I immediately turned the heat on religion and explained Christianity, and the man said: ‘You’ve got something there. I’ll take those two booklets.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“People unable to go from house to house because of illness can have part in witness work too, by telling the message to baker, groceryman and insurance man. One of my back-calls who was unable to go from door to door witnessed to her insurance man and told him to take his choice of any of the books. He said: ‘That’s fine.’ He selected </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Government.</span><span class="font7"> The following week he returned and said: ‘I stayed up all night and finished it, and then sat down and ordered the set for myself. I intend to read all of them.’ I told her I would be glad to let her have one of my phonographs and latest records to play for him. She is delighted with the offer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“One publisher with arthritis finds a marvelous way of witnessing is to go through the telephone book and, upon calling, ask people to come to her apartment to hear a very important message. When the people come in, she has them wind up the phonograph and play the records and has all the books on display.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PHONOGRAPH DURING NOON HOUR AT THE SHOP</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The place where I work is a small foundry. I had never played any records in the shop before, but felt that this important series should be played wherever possible. The way I proceeded was this: I drew up a sign and tacked it up on the company billboard. I played the series for three days in a row, with an audience of 60 to 70 people daily, which consisted mostly of Italian, Portuguese and Polish workers of the younger generation. They listened to ‘Fascism or Freedom’ pretty attentively, with, of course, the usual comments from a few cranks. One fellow said: ‘That’s a Communist lecture’; and a big Finnish molder hollered back: ‘Shut up; you confess to the priest, you!’ And nothing more was heard for the rest of the lecture from that man. At the conclusion a copy of the lecture was offered to them free if they personally requested it, but no one came up to ask. However, about ten fellows told me they enjoyed the lecture and would like to hear more. So I posted another sign: ‘All persons of good will who desire to learn more of the schemes of the Fascists to gain control of the world may hear another series of lectures to be played at the pattern storage department from now on during noon hours. Upon request these lectures will be played in Italian, Polish and Portuguese.’ Two persons have showed up at the Pattern Storage Dept, and like the series. I am going to continue to play the series, and whoever shows interest, try to place the seven-booklet combination with them and otherwise aid them to get a knowledge of the truth. I have come to the conclusion that the phonograph can be played practically anywhere. I carry it with my lunch to work, or, if I’m out walking in the park or any other place, the phonograph is with me. This is a time of war, and one should be always on guard to save as much time as possible for the Lord’s business.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">REACHING THOSE IN ALASKA</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The phonograph record is surely grand to place </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> subscriptions. I will take four times as many subscriptions as I expected. I am mailing to about 200 subscribers for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font7"> in Alaska the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font7"> with a letter asking them to subscribe for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower;</span><span class="font7"> also to many that subscribed in the past.”</span></p>
