<p><span class="font3">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos Is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to lite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus Is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark5"></a>DOOM OF RELIGION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“For it is the day of the Lord’s vengeance, and the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion.” —Isa. 34:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH makes it clearly to appear that he always squares the account with the enemy. For a long period of time God permits the enemy to carry on without let or hindrance and then Jehovah chooses his own due time to fully pay the enemy for all they have done. The present time is the day of Jehovah and the time when his faithful witnesses must declare the “vengeance of our God”. This must he done before the pay-off. The religionists now make a great controversy with Zion, God’s capital organization, which is represented on the earth by the faithful witnesses of Jehovah, and so Jehovah says: “It is . . . the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion.” God first informs his faithful servants of his purpose to duly recompense the enemy, and then he sends his witnesses forth to serve notice on the enemy that within a short time God will destroy them.—Jer. 51: 6, 56.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">* Today “Catholic Action” is extremely vicious within every part of “Christendom”. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy-Nazi combine, in their bitter opposition to the Theocracy, make war upon Jehovah’s witnesses. By threats and by the practice of boycott against the commercial dealers the men of the Hierarchy get themselves exalted and praised by the newspapers, and this at the expense of others. The Hierarchy try to make themselves and others believe that they are actually riding on the top of the world and that they shall rule the world in the place and stead of God’s King, Christ Jesus. The clergy are proud, boastful, arrogant and cruel, and at the same time they show their cowardice. Unable to longer hide from the honest people their practice of a religious racket, the clergy send out the vicious young Nazi element to commit assaults upon Jehovah’s witnesses. The real criminals, guilty of such vicious assaults, are the higher-ups of the Hierarchy. They think out the means of performing wicked deeds and have others to do such deeds for them. They think they can get away with their wicked deeds committed against those who serve God and his King. In his due time the Lord God will take a hand and bring down that self-exalted Hierarchy; nor will the religious racketeers come to their end in peace, but their end will be in war at the hand of Christ the King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> King David was a type of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is written of David that the word of God was in his mouth and that he spoke as the spirit of God directed him. (2 Sam. 23:2) The “serpent” breed of Saul pictures the religionists, and that enemy had cruelly fought against David, the Lord’s anointed. In his last days David gave to Solomon the charge that he should duly recompense those who had persecuted him and carried on a campaign against David, and which cruel campaign pictured what today is called “Catholic Action” against Jehovah’s anointed ones now on the earth. David named some of the leaders of that wicked campaign against him and their specific deeds of wickedness, and among which was Joab. Concerning him David said: “Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.” (1 Ki. 2:6) Shimei cursed and assaulted David, even as the Hierarchy and their deluded agents have cursed and assaulted Jehovah’s witnesses. Shimei means “renowned”; even as the big men of the Hierarchy now are renowned. Both Shimei and the Hierarchy are the seed of the Serpent. The prophet of Jehovah said of that wicked persecutor Shimei, and which words of the prophet apply with even stronger force to the wicked Hierarchy, to wit: “Now therefore hold him not guiltless; for thou art a wise man, and know-est what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood.” (1 Ki. 2:9) As the Lord through David directed Solomon what to do, he thus foreshadows what He will shortly bring to pass with reference to the Catholic Hierarchy and wicked allies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">* The Hierarchy and Nazi combine have heaped affliction upon Jehovah’s witnesses, committing many cruel deeds of wickedness against them, and they continue to do so. So concerning them the Lord says: “And shall not God avenge his own elect, which</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth ?”—Luke 18: 7, 8.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Jehovah now by revealing the meaning of the prophecy of Joel to his people informs them of his purpose toward the enemy. Furthermore, with reference to the just recompense that God will visit upon the Hierarchy, the leaders of the religious organization and religious persecutors which compose the Devil’s organization called “Babylon”, the Greater David, Christ Jesus, says: “For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities. Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works; in the cup which she hath filled, fill to her double. How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her; for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.” (Rev. 18: 5-7) Thus is the judgment of Jehovah written against that wicked, religious crowd that has defamed his name. Let the faithful followers of Christ Jesus now know that these things were written in the Scriptures for the information, aid, comfort and hope of those who now proclaim the theocratic government while the enemy heaps upon them great persecution. (Rom. 15:4) Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany have suffered and continue to suffer at the hand of the Nazis and Hierarchy conspirators; but let such faithful followers of Christ continue for a little season, fully trusting in God. He will square the account and see to it that those religious conspirators shall not go down to the grave in peace. What follows in the prophecy of Joel discloses what Jehovah will do to the religious conspirators who fight against his witnesses and his government by Christ the King. First God informs his people what he purposes to do, and then discloses to them how he will do it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> In preceding issues of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoiver</span><span class="font5"> Scriptural evidence has been published showing that Jehovah has anointed with his spirit the faithful ones whom the Lord has brought into the temple, and that these are then sent forth to proclaim Jehovah’s name and the day of his vengeance, and that this divine commission given them they must faithfully perform and rendei<sup>1</sup> unto the Lord a full report. From 1918 onward is the period known as “those days” and “that time”, which words are used by the prophet; and it is the time in which the Lord gathers unto himself his people, anoints them, commissions them and sends them forth to do his work, and within that time God also assembles the enemy, gives them notice and warning, and then administers a just recompense of reward; and therefore he says through his prophet: “For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem.” (Joel 3:1) Particularly since 1922 the Lord has brought out of captivity those of “Judah” and “Jerusalem” and has put them to work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> In this part of the prophecy Jehovah foretells that in those days when he pours out his spirit upon his people he calls upon the remnant to come to Zion to be anointed and commands them to have a part in his work, as mentioned in Joel 2:29. At that time, that is, after the Lord appears at the temple for judgment, he brings his faithful people out from Satan’s organization and sets them free from fear of Satan’s crowd that they may boldly and fearlessly serve God and his King. This is the first time the prophecy of Joel mentions the captivity of God’s remnant, the faithful oppressed ones who, after 1918, were brought out of captivity for a purpose, and concerning which faithful ones God, by his prophet, declares : “Thus saith the Lord of hosts, The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together, and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go. Their Redeemer is strong; the Lord of hosts is his name; he shall thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.” (Jer. 50:33,34) This shows that the Lord Jesus Christ, the Field Marshal of Jehovah who commands His warriors, comes forth fully prepared for war when a just recompense shall be ministered unto the enemy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Jehovah then begins to maneuver the enemy into a position for their destruction, and these who compose the enemy on earth are gathered from all the nations. “I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land.”—Joel 3: 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> All parts and all elements of Satan’s visible representatives are gathered. This prophecy is further corroborated by the testimony of another prophet of Jehovah, to wit: “Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger; for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.”—Zeph. 3: 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> The gathering work of the Lord begins after the outpouring of the holy spirit upon his approved ones. The facts show that this has been done since 1922. How is the gathering done? Jehovah sends forth his duly commissioned witnesses to declare (and who do declare) his message of vengeance, that his time of final settlement of the account which will vindicate his name is come. He also causes his witnesses to proclaim that his anointed King and his kingdom are come. Instead of compromising with the Devil’s organization the faithful witnesses under the command of Christ Jesus serve notice that within a short period of time the Lord will cut the enemy to pieces.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> The inevitable effect of the proclamation of God’s message aforementioned is to expose the Catholic Hierarchy and their religious allies, clearly disclosing that religion is a fraud and a snare and the means of carrying on a racket by those who are agents of the Devil, and which crowd defame Jehovah’s name and turn the people into the way of destruction. Stung by God’s message of truth, the Hierarchy and agents urge all the nations and the ruling element thereof, as well as the hoodlums, to join in a world-wide conspiracy against the witnesses of Jehovah and hence against the Theocracy. The Hierarchy of Authority joins dictators of totalitarian governments in an effort to crush the witnesses who bear testimony for Jehovah’s kingdom. The complete proof of this conspiracy against Jehovah’s King and kingdom is daily brought to light. For instance, one Jesuit priest, in a radio speech, recently said: Tf the American people would stand up on their hind legs they could destroy Jehovah’s witnesses within an hour.’ That Jesuit priest is the agent of the Papacy, acting with the full approval of the pope and the others of the Hierarchy, even though the Hierarchy tries to hide this fact. In its efforts to hide the truth of its relationship to this Jesuit priest the Hierarchy resorts to lies, even as the Lord Jehovah foretold in Isaiah 28:15. The ambition of that Jesuit radio priest is to be the dictator of America when the Papacy takes over the control of the American nation. Similar programs are progressing in other nations of the earth. Thus the enemy are playing right into the hand of Jehovah’s Executioner, Christ Jesus, by taking their position that they may be destroyed at Armageddon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> The enemy forces must be brought to the site of battle, and therefore says Jehovah: “I . . . will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat.” The enemy must be brought there in order to see and be convinced that Jehovah is supreme and the One whose power must prevail against the totalitarian rulers and all other parts of Satan’s organization, all of which oppose the Theocracy. The enemy forces are not brought down to the so-called “valley of Jehoshaphat” which is shown in the maps of modern days. The Bible expression “valley of Jehoshaphat” does not apply to such literal valley. This statement of Joel is the only place in the Bible where the expression “valley of Jehoshaphat” occurs, and it is certainly symbolic and refers to the same thing pictured by the valley where Moab, Ammon and the hordes of Mount Seir fought it out and were destroyed. (2 Chronicles 20) Thereafter King Jehoshaphat called that place “the valley of Berachah” because there his people blessed the name of the Lord for the vindication of His name, which he had done by the complete destruction of the enemy. (2 Chron. 20:26) The name “valley of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehoshaphat”</span><span class="font5"> means “Jehovah judged” or “Jehovah vindicated” and shows that the battle site refers to the time of the complete vindication of his name by his anointed Vindicator, Christ Jesus, the great Judge and King.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Further says the prophecy: “And will plead with them there for my people.” The pleading here named does not mean that it will be done by petitions, protest, warning, or other means employed by Jehovah’s witnesses during the period of his “strange work”. It means much more than that. When the pleading here mentioned takes place the “strange work” of Jehovah will have been completed. The Hebrew word here rendered “plead” is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">shaphat,</span><span class="font5"> and which word is a part of the name of the valley of Jehoshaphat. This is proof that the valley is symbolic and does not refer to the valley of Palestine where the Jews buried their dead, but is symbolically applied to the time and place when Jehovah will perform his “strange act” resulting in the complete destruction of the enemy. God does not plead for “Christendom”, but his pleading act is in behalf of his people who bear his name, to wit, the faithful servants of the Most High. At Armageddon Jehovah will deal with all nations and peoples and will cause them to know and fully realize that the faithful witnesses whom he has anointed are truly his own people who serve him without compromise. He will show the nations that Jehovah’s witnesses, whom the religionists and allies hate and denounce as unpatriotic and against whom the enemy applies many wicked epithets, are truly God’s anointed ones who bear his holy name and who now represent him on the earth. Note other corroborative prophecies bearing upon this point: “For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon [over] them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants; and ye shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me.” (Zech. 2:9) “And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.”—Ezek. 33: 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ The people in whose behalf Jehovah pleads, as the prophecy says, are “my heritage”. Such are the 144,000 members of the body of Christ and are the ones that Jehovah inherits of the earthly people; that is to say, Jehovah takes them out from and away from the earth and they are his firstfruits and rightly belong to him, and he takes them for his service in heaven with Christ Jesus. Concerning this it is written: “And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father’s name written in their foreheads. And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder; and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps; and they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders; and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth. These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.” (Rev. 14:1-4) These faithful ones being God’s “firstfruits” and his “heritage”, no one can with impunity touch them or use them for selfish purposes. Any creature or class of creatures that try to destroy Jehovah’s anointed people shall bring upon their heads their own destruction. These great truths the nations must learn when at Armageddon Jehovah pleads for his people, and that is the time he will vindicate his name and his people who bear his name.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> God declares his purpose to have in mind at Armageddon his people whom the enemy has persecuted and do persecute, and this is seen when he says: “Whom they [the enemy] have scattered among the nations, and parted my land.” During the World War the religious enemy and allies broke up the world-wide work of Jehovah’s people operating together as a Society. The enemy did not then want to believe that these faithful Christians were Jehovah’s servants and representatives on the earth. The enemy do not believe it now, because they continue in their efforts to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses and the work in which they are engaged. A striking example of the enemy’s efforts was made manifest on June 25, 1939. Madison Square Garden was the key assembly, from which point originated the program of Jehovah’s witnesses which throughout the English-speaking part of the world was heard by other assemblies. The enemy made a desperate effort at New York and at London and at other places to break up that convention of God’s people, but, by God’s grace, the enemy did not succeed. True to his promise, “they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord.” (Jer. 1:19) God thus put his hand over his servants and over the work they were doing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Now the Lord has gathered his people into his spiritual temple by Christ Jesus, and henceforth no matter what the totalitarian nations made up of religionists and dictators may do to the physical body of the various members of the temple company, or to their material possession, the enemy cannot put the anointed out of the temple or break up their spiritual unity in Christ Jesus their Head. He who is The “Faithful and True” Servant of the Most High will defend those who are with him. The vicious acts of the enemy toward Jehovah’s witnesses increase constantly. Such vicious acts of violence are incited by the clergy or leaders amongst the religionists, and it is to be expected that such acts of opposition and violence will increase until Armageddon. The Scriptures show that, immediately before Armageddon begins, the Devil’s host will, by Gog, the field marshal of Satan, come against all those wlio are on the side of Jehovah in an effort to destroy those faithful to the Lord and that such horde of wicked ones will not succeed in their efforts, but, on the contrary, Christ will gain the victory over them.—Ezekiel chapters 38 and 39.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RESISTANCE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>17</sup> Shall the people of Jehovah God resist with force the efforts of Satan’s agents to prevent the forward work of proclaiming the message of the kingdom f If that question is answered in the affirmative, how can such course of action be harmonized with the scriptures which follow: “For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds.” (2 Cor. 10: 4) Religionists, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, in an effort to make the people acknowledge and obey their religious tenets, have used and continue to use and employ force and violence. All who will not become religionists and support the Roman Catholic Hierarchy are denounced as heretics, and says the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, “The killing of heretics may be rightly done by Catholics whenever Catholics are strong enough.” During the Inquisition the Hierarchy employed carnal weapons to compel the people to become submissive to the Papacy and practice the Hierarchy’s religion, and many people suffered cruel punishment and the destruction of their property and life because they refused to obey the demands of the Hierarchy to become Catholic. In contrast to such wicked action the apostle Paul, under inspiration of the holy spirit, points out what is the proper course for God’s servants. Jehovah’s witnesses now go forth to preach the truth of God’s kingdom, and not to compel anyone to accept that truth. They place the message of the kingdom before the people, and it is the privilege of the people to accept it or reject it. They are commanded that in doing their work they shall not employ carnal weapons, as the Catholics have repeatedly done to make others accept their doctrines. The weapons of God’s people consist of “the sword of the spirit, which is the Word of God”, and which is mighty to the pulling down of strongholds. The words of the apostle, therefore, apply strictly to the means of carrying on their work of preaching this gospel of the kingdom. Jehovah’s witnesses are messengers of peace, telling forth the purposes of God, and they have no need of carnal weapons to compel the people to hear the Word of God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Another scripture that is often used in this connection is this, spoken by Jesus: “But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil; but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.” (Matt. 5: 39) “Evil” is properly defined as that which brings just punishment upon the wrongdoer. God says: “I . . . create evil.” (Isa. 45:7) All of God’s creation is right and perfect, and therefore evil is far different from wickedness. (Deut. 32:4) The law covenant with Israel inflicted just punishment upon the violators of that covenant, and that punishment was evil to the Israelites justly administered. Jesus was addressing the Israelites, and his language employed at Matthew 5: 29-42 surely does not literally mean that a man should pluck out his physical eye or cut off his hand. His speech was used symbolically. Jesus used figures of speech in pointing out to the Israelites what was and should be their proper attitude toward their adversary, that is to say, the law covenant. As further proof of this Jesus said: “Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.”—Matt. 5: 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> If one suffered from his adversary, the law covenant, that was evil which proceeded justly from God and was not to be resisted, but, in further corroborative phrase, the Lord Jesus said: 'If the wrongdoer was smitten upon one cheek, he should even turn the other and receive a just smiting, rather than to resist; thus he would show his submissiveness to the will of God.’ All the scriptures are consistent, and none are contradictory. The words of the foregoing text could not be literally applied to such as Joshua, who led the army of Israel against the enemy, and many other like instances which are recorded in the Bible. Jesus, in speaking of being smitten on the cheek, was addressing his words specifically to the Jews who were under the law covenant and which law covenant was their adversary to keep them in line and punish them when they violated the terms of the covenant. The resisting of evil, as those words were used by the Lord Jesus in addressing the Israelites, therefore, could not mean that God’s people are to willingly submit to a beating at the hands of others who assault God’s servants while they are preaching the gospel of the kingdom. Jesus had no reference to such when thus addressing the Israelites ; rather his words must mean that if evil comes upon those in the covenant from the adversary, the law covenant, they must not resist, but receive the same as a just punishment from the Lord, and to further prove their willingness they must go the limit of their ability in obeying their lawful adversary. In support of this note the context, to wit: “And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also. And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.” (Matt. 5:40,41) Note here also that Jesus said nothing about resisting wickedness. One who assaults the servant of the Lord in the performance of his duty is acting wickedly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> When Jesus was arrested Peter cut off the ear of one of the high priest’s servants and Jesus commanded Peter to put up the sword: “And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest’s, and smote off his ear. Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place; for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?”—Matt. 26:51-53.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> Note the reason why. It was not the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">proper time </span><span class="font5">to engage in physical combat, because Jesus’ time had come for him to be taken. Before Pilate Jesus said: “My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews.” (John 18: 36) “This world,” as here used by Christ Jesus, would mean this wicked world over which the Devil is the god and which Jesus was not permitted to interrupt until God’s due time, when Jehovah, in 1914, sent him forth to rule. The clear inference to be drawn from the words of Jesus here is, there would in the future be a proper time to fight, but Jesus must wait until that due time fixed by Jehovah, and then he will fight to a finish. (Ps. 110: 2, 6; Rev. 19:11-20) There is a time for everything. “A time of war; and a time of peace.” (Eccl. 3:1-8) The foregoing scriptures do not mean that the Christian can with impunity go about hunting trouble and getting into a fight; nor do they mean that the Christians must willingly permit the agents of Satan to destroy their efforts to preach God’s kingdom message.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DEFENSE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> Do the Scriptures approve of a Christian’s defending himself against an unlawful assault and using force to repel such assault? Self-defense is the right of every man to ward off an attack and to use such force as to him appears to be necessary to safeguard himself from personal injury or injury to his property. The same right of self-defense may be exercised by him for the protection of his near relations or close friends, his brethren. Such is the law of the nations or states, but that law does not rest upon tradition, nor upon the conclusions of men alone, but finds complete support in the Word of God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> Moses saw an Egyptian smiting his Hebrew brother, and Moses, to protect his brother from such assault, slew the Egyptian. (Ex. 2:11,12) Moses fled from Egypt that the Egyptians might not kill him. Moses did not receive any punishment or even a rebuke from Jehovah God for what he had done. </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Af</span><span class="font5">terwards God specifically used Moses to do and perform service particularly picturing Christ Jesus the Messiah and his work. God also made Moses his prophet and used him to write the first five books of the Bible. Since then every nation has invoked the law of self-defense, extending that right of selfdefense to the protection of near-of-kin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>24</sup> The law of self-defense is further emphasized by what is written in the Scriptures which showed that it is right and proper for Jehovah’s servants to prepare in advance for self-defense. Nehemiah, the approved servant of Jehovah God, led a company of his brethren, whom Jehovah brought forth from captivity and sent to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. When those faithful men in obedience to God’s commandment began the building of the wall, Sanballat (picturing the religious leaders who oppose God’s kingdom) and his followers made repeated threats against Nehemiah and his brethren, which threats were brought to the attention of Nehemiah. Then Nehemiah prayed to God, and this was his prayer: “Hear, 0 our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity; and cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders.”—Neh. 4: 4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> The enemy had conspired together to fight against Nehemiah and his brethren; as it is written: “But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth, and conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.”—Neh. 4: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>26</sup> Did Nehemiah instruct his brethren to willingly permit themselves to be smitten on one cheek and to then turn the other cheek and ask to be smitten on that also? Did Nehemiah tell his brethren to quit work and hole up to safeguard themselves from the attacks of the enemy ? He certainly did not, but made ready for self-defense, and his answer is written in the Scriptures, to wit: “Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows. And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord which is great and terrible, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses&quot;— </span><span class="font5">Neh. 4:13,14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2 T</sup> In order that the Jews might work and that they might not be stopped in their work by reason of the enemy’s assaults, Nehemiah further says, “they which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon. For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.”—Neh. 4:17,18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> Surely the Jews did not have those swords there merely as a bluff, but to be used when necessary to protect themselves and to prevent the enemy from interfering with the work which God had commanded them to do. Can anyone successfully contend that the enemy of God’s kingdom can compel the servants of God to now cease their work which God has commanded them to do in order that they might avoid trouble? Did not Jesus command that they must go forward with their work without regard to threats and without fear of those who might kill their physical body? (Matt. 10: 28) The watchfulness of Nehemiah and his brethren, who even slept with their clothes on in order to be ready, is a striking example for those to whom the Lord has committed the kingdom interests at the present time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>29</sup> Again the Lord God approves the use of force to be applied against one “breaking up” that which does not belong to the ‘breaker-up’: “If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there shall no blood be shed for him.” (Ex. 22: 2) One who attempts to commit an unlawful act against another may be dealt with, and against such wrongdoer such degree of force may be used by the one assaulted as may to him appear to be necessary to protect his property or himself or kin from an assault of the wrongdoer. Jesus used whips to drive the disorderly ones out of the temple, and he did not invite them to smite him on the cheek.—John 2:15.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>80</sup> Now Christ Jesus, the antitypical Moses, is present. His kingdom is come. He sends forth his representatives under command to proclaim “this gospel of the kingdom”. No one has the right to interfere with the execution of that command. Even the law of the land provides that when one unlawfully attempts to “break up” a meeting or assembly of people who have come together to hear proclaimed the Word of God such disturber or ‘breaker-up’ is guiit\ of a misdemeanor and may be dealt with accordingly. On the 25th of June, 1939, approximately 20,000 people assembled peaceably and lawfully at Madison</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Square Garden, New York, to hear proclaimed the message of God’s Word concerning his kingdom. Persons who oppose God’s kingdom had repeatedly made threats that they would break up that assembly, and these threats had been brought to the attention of the Lord’s people. Even the police officers had been notified of such threats. On the day of the meeting several hundred of such wicked ones entered the Madison Square Garden meeting after the program had begun, and made a violent attempt to “break up” that meeting. Ushers, whose assigned duty was to keep order, commanded the disturbers to stop their disturbance or else leave the building. Instead of complying with that request the disturbers violently assaulted the ushers. Some of the ushers in the exercise of their God-given and lawful rights resisted such assaults and used reasonable and necessary force to repel such wrongful assaults. In doing so the ushers acted strictly within their rights and in the performance of their duty and certainly have the approval of the Lord in so doing. The ushers were not using carnal weapons in order to preach the gospel, but they were using force to compel the enemy to desist in efforts to prevent the preaching of the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ADMONITION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>81</sup> In the exercise of self-defense caution must be strictly observed and no one should act hastily and without warrant. Christians must obey the law. They must not use physical force in repelling an assault unless it appears to them as reasonably necessary for their own protection and the protection of their brethren and of their property or work. The Christian should do what he can to avoid physical combat and should never seek physical combat. But when, in the lawful performance of his duty, a Christian is attacked by the enemy and the enemy attempts to destroy the Christian’s property or to violently assault the Christian, then the Christian may use such force as at the time appears to him to be necessary to ward off such an assault. When going about in the service of the Lord, and by distributing literature pertaining to his Word or in performing other like and proper service, if Jehovah’s witnesses are attacked by a mob, and if it appears necessary that such witnesses employ force to repel or ward off such assault, then they may properly use such force as to them appears to be necessary for their protection or defense of themselves and their property. They should employ physical force only as a last resort for their self-protection against the wrongdoers. But no one, because he is a Christian, is compelled to willingly and without resistance submit to an attack of a ruffian or others who attempt to prevent him from going lawfully about his work of preaching the gospel. This gospel of the kingdom must be proclaimed, and it will be proclaimed. God has warned his people that the enemy will fight against them, and has plainly told them that the enemy shall not prevail. Hence they should go forward without fear in the performance of their duty, exercising their lawful rights.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>82</sup> If an officer of the law in the exercise of his official duty places a Christian under arrest, then the person so arrested should not resist the officer but should go quietly with the officer and await the proper time to have a hearing and make his defense before the properly constituted tribunal. Such course is acting in an orderly and proper manner. The officer may have no right to arrest the Christian or interfere with his work, but the officer is acting in behalf of the state and there is a proper place to determine the question as to whether he is right or wrong.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>33</sup> When Christians are assembled together to hear discussed the Word of God or to study the Word of God no one has the right to attempt to break up that assembly, and when any person or crowd of persons attempt to do so they may be properly resisted and dealt with, and in so resisting them such physical force may be used against the disturbers as may to the ones peaceably assembled appear to be reasonably proper. At Madison Square Garden meeting a crowd of lawless men entered for the expressed purpose of breaking up the meeting. They started a riot without any excuse. One of the rioters, struck an usher a terrific blow on the head, and that assault was resisted. Then the wife of that rioter rushed forward and grabbed the usher by his secret parts. God foreknew that the Devil would put in operation such wicked tactics, and he made provision in his law for such, and which law of God reads: “When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets; then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity her.”—Deut. 25:11,12.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>84</sup> Although complaint was made against this woman, she was not arrested. All of God’s laws are just and right, whereas the law of nations and the enforcement thereof often comes short of what is just and right. We must let the Lord properly recompense such wrongdoers. Jehovah’s witnesses and companions are here admonished to walk circumspectly and strictly within the pale of the law and never seek a controversy. They should act in a dignified and considerate manner with all. But when wrongfully assaulted by representatives of Satan who oppose God’s kingdom and the proclamation of the kingdom message, then it is the privilege and duty of those who fully trust and serve God to resist such unlawful assault.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>85</sup> The ushers at Madison Square Garden carried light walking sticks as a means of identification. They had been threatened by lawless ones, and it now appears to have been well, for the safeguarding of themselves from cruel assaults, that they had such walking canes. According to the law of the land and the law of God, when one is threatened with bodily harm, he has the perfect right to arm himself for the purpose of self-defense.—Neh. 4:7-18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>86</sup> Religionists, and particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, are never diligent to abide by the law of God, nor even by the law of the land, unless it suits their convenience. The Hierarchy proceed according to their own rules, and that without regard to the rights of others, and many of their chief men advocate cruel punishment of all those whom they call “heretics”, even to the point of killing of men who do not agree with their Catholic doctrines. God foreknew and foretold this very thing by and through his prophet. Note now that in these “last days” God makes known to his people the true condition and calls attention to the wrongful acts of religionists and tells his people in advance of such ill-treatment of his faithful servants. Such persecutors shall soon receive at God’s hand a just recompense. (Joel 3: 7) Concerning ill-treatment it is written: “And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.”—Joel 3: 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>87</sup> Mark the indisputable facts showing fulfillment of this prophecy: “They have cast lots for my people.” During the World War the religionists conspired together to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses, and in that conspiracy they were aided by that “extinguished” “Knight of St. Gregory” who held some of those Christians in prison without bail, while that man, bearing the title of a high judicial officer, betrayed the nation and sold his judicial decisions for filthy lucre; concerning which unlawful commercial dealings with his high judicial office, and concerning his conviction of that crime, the Catholic press today remains absolutely silent. During the World War faithful Christians, who were endeavoring to inform the people of God’s gracious provision for their salvation, were captured by religious conspirators and then were debased to the level of mere stake or prize money of common gamblers, acting exactly as the former religionists, the Edomites, had done toward God’s typical people. (Obadiah 11) The religionists treated Christ Jesus cheaply, when he was impaled on the tree, by casting lots for his garments. (Matt. 27:35) To this day the religionists continue to use violence, to devise methods and practices against faithful followers of Christ Jesus, and also to incite the ignorant to use violence towards God’s servants. In this connection God calls attention to his purpose to duly recompense such wrongdoers as he did to other wrongdoers in the past: “Yet was she [Nineveh, in Assyria] carried away, she went into captivity; her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets; and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.”—Nahum 3:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>88</sup> In this day chance or lot-casting no more decides into whose possession or control God’s faithful people shall fall. God has his hand over his own, and he will avenge them in due season.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>88</sup> Further citing examples of the wicked acts of religionists, which acts point to what the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has long since been doing, the prophet of God says: “And have given a boy [of Judah, that is, those who serve and praise Jehovah God] for an harlot.” Such exchange is a gross insult to God. In order to commit illicit acts (which are commonly called “fornication”) with Satan’s world, the clergy have handed over the young and faithful servants of God to their worldly allies that such faithful Christians may be traded and dealt with by political and judicial men as though they were the most debased of earth. The clergy have thus been willing to surrender up the servants of God and Christ, whom the clergy had sworn to serve, in order to deliver over the true servants of God and Christ that the religionists might receive the favor of political rulers of the land. The Scriptures plainly set forth God’s conclusion concerning such, to wit: “Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.”—Jas. 4: 4.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>40</sup> Further describing the wicked practices of religionists towards God’s faithful covenant people his prophet records: “And sold a girl [of Judah, that is. those who serve and praise Jehovah] for wine, that they might drink.” Rather than stand for the defense of the Lord’s true servants, the religionists have commercialized them for the sake of imbibing the wine of Satan, who rules this world, that they may act hilariously with the visible rulers of the world. For this reason the religious leaders, particularly the Hierarchy, indulge in crooked politics of the land and create and boldly operate a political machine and brazenly carry on their work under the pretense of serving God, and thus deceive the people by naming their organization a “religious” one. In order to gain such worldly exhilaration the religious leaders surrender all their privileges of serving God and receiving his approval. Not only did they betray the Lord’s cause and kingdom during the World War but they still continue to do so, approving and aid ing the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany and in other totalitarian states. They oppose freedom of assembly and freedom of speech and freedom of worship and urge their fanatical and benighted dupes to indulge in violence against those who peaceably assemble for the true worship of God and Christ.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>41</sup> Further addressing his opposers, Jehovah says: “Yea, and what have ye to do with me, 0 Tyre, and Zidon, and all the coasts of Palestine? will ye render me a recompence? and if ye recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return your recompence upon your own head.” (Joel 3:4) Literally, according to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Version,</span><span class="font5"> this text reads: “What are ye to me?” That is to say, What acts have you to settle with me that you feel justified in persecuting those who represent me and who belong to me? The Bible record shows nothing that would furnish an excuse, much less any justification, for Tyre’s malicious conduct toward the typical people of God. Ancient Tyre had been permitted to remain in the land of Palestine, although God had given the land to the Israelites according to his promise to Abraham. (Judg. 3:1-3) Tyre was a type of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy organization, and modern Tyre has long been permitted by the Lord to operate her political racket without interference. Jehovah’s faithful servants have never been guilty of violence or any unlawful acts against the Hierarchy. They have never even called in question the liberty of that organization to practice their religion. They have never objected to their freedom of speech. Jehovah’s witnesses have only obeyed God’s law and commandments in pointing out to the people the distinction between religion and the practice thereof and the true worship of Almighty God properly called “Christianity”. This Jehovah’s witnesses have done and are doing in obedience to the Lord’s commandment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>42</sup> As to Zidon, mentioned in the foregoing text, that city pictured the heathen religions which are much older and from which the Papacy sprang. Concerning such Jehovah’s witnesses have only pointed out the truth of all religions, and none of such religions have either excuse or justification for ill-treating Jehovah’s witnesses in doing this in obedience to God’s law. These heathen religionists, operating in Japan and other places, led by and working with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, are included in the word “Zidon” used here. To all religionists, and particularly their leaders, God says: “Will ye render me a recompence?” That is to say, Are you trying to pay me for exposing your crookedness and pointing out that you have been and are serving Satan, my adversary? Is it your purpose to do acts of opposition to me as if you could get away with it, and thus show your contempt of me? Do you think yourself immune from punishment, as if you were independent of and superior to me? As described at Joel 3:2,3, religious leaders who pretend to serve God have treated Jehovah’s witnesses contemptuously and are therefore in line for due recompense at the hands of the Lord, because he says to them: “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my [servants], ye have done it unto me.” (Matt. 25:40) Furthermore says the Lord: “And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily.”—Luke 18:7,8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>43</sup> Now in these “last days” it is not, “If ye recompense me,” as stated in the language of the prophecy, but, having done their wicked deeds, as the prophet foretold, in their contempt and defiance of Jehovah God, therefore the day of settlement has arrived and the account will be settled at the battle of Armageddon, when the enemy will be completely paid off for their wrongdoing. The Lord is now at the temple and plainly says that as soon as the witness work, which is God’s “strange work”, is done, there will be no delay in the settlement of the account with the enemy, for then “sudden destruction cometh upon them”, and none shall escape.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>44</sup> The capital organization of Jehovah is symbolized by gold, and so God says to his opposers: “Because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples [of Devil worship] my goodly pleasant things.” (Joel 3: 5) Thus the religionists and allies forcibly and wrongfully snatch up the servants of Jehovah and throw them into prison. Such wrongful seizure of the things belonging to God has been indulged in by religionists at many times in the past, foreshadowing what modern-day religionists have done and are doing to those who serve Jehovah and his kingdom today. One of the wrongful acts in the type is set forth at 1 Samuel 5:1, 2, where the account shows that the Philistines took the ark of the covenant and ‘&quot;brought it into the house of Dagon”. Again it is noted, the Babylonians </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">got</span><span class="font5"> their religion from the Devil, as did Nimrod, and the Babylonians carried off the vessels of the house of the Lord (Jehovah) and put them in the temple of Babylon. (2 Chron. 36:6,7; Dan. 5:1-4) Truths of the Bible set forth in the publications by Jehovah’s witnesses have been seized by the religionists and destroyed. In their religious newspapers they have roasted, and some maliciously lied about, the Lord’s people and have misapplied Bible texts, and therefore tried to make it appear that Jehovah’s witnesses are unpatriotic, anti-Christian and sedition-ists. Everything that belongs to the Lord and that should be devoted to his service the religionists have seized hold upon and used for their religious temples, to make it appear that Jehovah’s witnesses obey a God who is weak, feeble and unable to protect those who faithfully serve him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>48</sup> Continuing to recount the wicked deeds of religionists, God, through his prophet, says: “The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[(E.R.V.)</span><span class="font5"> the sons of] the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border.” (Joel 3:6) “Judah” and “Jerusalem” refer to those who serve and praise Jehovah God. The religionists have sold Jehovah’s witnesses unto Devil worshipers, the enemies of God, who war against his people, and therefore God says to them by another prophet: “I have . . . raised up thy sons, 0 Zion, against thy sons, 0 Greece, and made thee [Zion] as a sword of a mighty man.” (Zech. 9:13) Religionists, led by the Hierarchy, deal with and treat Jehovah’s witnesses as a thing for sale or commercial gain. They have also “sold themselves” to do wickedly in the sight of God and “to provoke him to anger”.—2 Ki. 17:17.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>48</sup> And why have religionists done so ? The prophecy answers: ‘That ye might move them from their border,’ the purpose of the enemy being, if possible, to separate the faithful from God, even as the Devil claimed he could do. The effort of the religionists is to deliver Jehovah’s witnesses to their foes and to deprive them of their liberty to serve God. Thanks be unto Jehovah that the time is at hand when he will render a just recompense to the enemy, because the day of his vengeance is at hand; and now mark what God says he will do, and the manner of his doing, to the vindication of his own great name.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark7"></a>THE THREE GODS OF RELIGIOUS RACKETEERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font3">HE Bellarmine Society, of England, in its 24-page published attack on the witnesses of Jehovah, admits, on page 13, paragraph one: “Of course we cannot fully explain the mystery of the Blessed Trinity, by which three persons exist in one nature. But we can see that human nature is common to (but not numerically the same in) John and Paul. Yet John and Paul are different persons. The Divine Nature is numerically one, but in God there are three divine Persons. Thus, if we ask </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">What</span><span class="font3"> is the First Person of the Blessed Trinity? the answer is: God. If we ask </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Who</span><span class="font3"> is the First Person? the answer is: The Father. And if we ask </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">What</span><span class="font3"> is the Second Person, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">What</span><span class="font3"> the Third ? the answer each time is: God. But if we ask </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Who</span><span class="font3"> are these Two? the answer is: The Son and the Holy Spirit (respectively). So there is only one God, but three divine Persons. This is very different from saying that in God there are three Persons in one person.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That the very word “trinity” is not found even once in the inspired Scriptures is admitted by </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Encyclopedia,</span><span class="font3"> Volume XV, under subhead “Trinity, The Blessed”, reading: “The Persons are co-eternal and coequal: all alike are uncreated and omnipotent. ... In Scripture there is as yet no single term by which the Three Divine Persons are denoted together. The word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">trias (of </span><span class="font3">which the Latin </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">trinitas</span><span class="font3"> is a translation) is first found in Theophilus of Antioch about A.D. 180. He speaks of ‘the Trinity of God [the Father], His Word and His Wisdom’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is no scripture to support the doctrine of the “trinity”. The text usually quoted by trinitarians as support, to wit, 1 John 5: 7, is spurious and is therefore omitted in all modern revised Bible &quot;versions, including the American Revised Version Bible. The Catholic Douay Version Bible (Haydock) is unwilling to admit this text is spurious. Its footnote thereon reads: “Ver. 7. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">There are three that give testimony in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost; and these three are one:</span><span class="font3"> i.e. one in nature, in substance, and in all perfections, in the same sense as when Christ himself said, (Jo.x.30.) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I and the Father are one, </span><span class="font3">or one thing. The Socinians [antitrinitarians of the sixteenth century] object that this verse is wanting in many Greek manuscripts; and even Erasmus in one edition, and Mr. Simon in his Critics, have questioned it, or rejected it, as a false reading, . . . The Socinians also object that this passage is not brought by S. Athanasius [of the Niecne creed of A.D. 325] and some other fathers against the Arians [antitrinitarians, followers of Arius], which they could scarce have omitted had they read this verse, but this only proves that this omission had happened in some MSS in their time, or, as some conjecture, that the Arians had corrupted some copies. S. Fulgentius [468-533 A.D., or over a century later] made use of it against the Arians, and also others about that time.” Says the Emphatic Diaglott translation’s footnote: “This text concerning the heavenly witness is not contained in any Greek manuscript which was written earlier than the fifth century. It is not cited by any of the Greek ecclesiastical writers; nor by any of the early Latin fathers, even when the subjects upon which they treated would naturally have led them to appeal to its authority. It is therefore evidently spurious.” The three oldest manuscripts in existence, to wit, the famous 4th century Vatican Manuscript No. 1209, the equally old Sinaitic MS., and the 5th century Alexandrine MS., do not contain the words of the text now numbered as 1 John 5: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is but one First Cause: He who is “from everlasting to everlasting” and “whose name alone is Jehovah&quot;, as stated at Psalms 90:2 and 83:18. He only original!' possessed immortality, “whom no man hath seen nor can see,” because he is divine, as shown at 1 Timothy 6:16. In his Word he states: “I am Jehovah, and there is none else; besides me there is no God.” (Isa. 45: 5, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev.</span><span class="font3"> V&lt; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">r.) </span><span class="font3">“I am Jehovah, that is my name; and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise unto graven images.&quot; (Isa. 42:8, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font3"> “Hear, 0 Israel: Jehovah our God </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[Elohim]</span><span class="font3"> is one Jehovah: and thou shalt love Jehovah I h.' God </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[Elohim]</span><span class="font3"> with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.”—Dcut. 6: 4, 5, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is a dishonor to his name and a reproach to his name to teach the people that there are three gods in one or one in three, to wit, God the Father and God the Son and God the Holy Ghost. The great Jehovah God is completely separate and distinct from all. He is the Creator. All others are creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus Christ is the Son of God. The name by which he is first known in the Scriptures is The Word, or (Greek) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Logos,</span><span class="font3"> which means the one who is the mouthpiece or word, or speaker, as Jehovah God’s instrument. He was the beginning of God’s creation, and from and after that time was the active agent by whom Jehovah God created all things that were created. According to the interlinear reading of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Emphatic Diaglott</span><span class="font3"> and which is a literal word-for-word translation of the original Greek the account at John 1:1-3 reads: “In a beginning was the Word [Logos], and the Word was with the God, and a god was the Word. This was in a beginning with the God. All through it [him] was done; and without it [him] was done not even one, that has been done.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Hebrew word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">elohim,</span><span class="font3"> as applying to Jehovah, is translated “God”. The great Jehovah is The God. The Son, the Logos, is A God. The name “god” (Hebrew: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">el</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">eloah) </span><span class="font3">is applied to mighty ones, even to angels and magistrates, as at Exodus 21:6; 22: 8, 9, 28 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">{margin),</span><span class="font3"> and Psalm 8: 5. The name “god” is therefore properly applied to the Son because he is a mighty one. The name “god” is appropriate to him because he is the agent used by the great Creator in the creation of all other things. The names Jehovah, Almighty God, and Most High are never in the Scriptures applied to Jesus, the Son of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus himself testifies that he was the beginning of God’s creation, by announcing himself, at Revelation 3:14, as “the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God”. When the time came for the creation of man, manifestly Jehovah God addressed his Son the Logos in these words: “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.” (Gen. 1:26) Later, when man had sinned and was to be expelled from Eden, manifestly Jehovah addressed his Son when He said: “Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil.”—Gen. 3: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Scriptures clearly show that Jehovah God, the great Creator, used another as his mighty instrument by which He has carried forward his purposes. That great One whom he has used as his instrument is his Son the Logos, Jesus, the Christ. The apostle Paul, with authority from God, wrote concerning Jesus as follows: “Who is the image of the invisible God, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the firstborn of every creature: </span><span class="font3">for by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: and he is before all things, and by him all things consist.”—Col. 1:15-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Religious racketeers, in order to support their false dogma of the trinity, have been forced to accept from Satan and to teach another lie, to wit, that the ehild born of Mary the virgin, which child grew to manhood and was crucified, was God himself; that while on earth he was a spirit and that the body of flesh that he used was merely an incarnation, whereas John 1:14 says: “The Word was made llesh, and dwelt among us.” They say God took upon himself the form of man and went about in this body of flesh for thirty-three and one-half years, and that during that time he was known as “the man Christ Jesus”. Their contention is that by being born as a man child the so-called “second person of the trinity” assumed a human body and that during all the time he was on earth Jesus was both God and man. Frequently, however, some of them say: ‘Jesus was very God and very man; he was God incarnate.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Note the absurdities to which such doctrine leads: The doctrine is: God is one, made up of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost. The logical conclusion then is that when God left heaven and took upon himself the form of man, which form he assumed for thirty-three and one-half years, during that time heaven was without God; therefore heaven must have operated itself. At the end of that period of time Jesus died an ignominious death upon the tree on Calvary, at which time he cried: “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” (Matt. 27:46) Jesus did thus cry either sincerely or for a fraudulent purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Scriptures show that God is immortal and cannot die. (1 Tim. 6:16) Therefore the trinity-incarnation dogma leads to the unavoidable conclusion that the so-called “dying” upon the tree was merely a sham and that Jesus did not die at all; and furthermore, that the words of agony uttered by Jesus were merely a subterfuge to deceive the people. If the one dying upon the tree was really God, how would it be reasonable for him to cry unto himself: “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” If Jesus was God himself and the Holy Ghost also, to whom was Jesus crying when nailed to the tree? The clergy look wise and say: “It is a mystery.” The fact is, it not only is a mystery but is a snare and a racket and a greatly magnified untruth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Furthermore, if at the time Jesus was on earth and if when consecrating himself to do God’s will at the time of his baptism in Jordan Jesus was God, then Jesus was more than a perfect man and could not be a ransom price corresponding to that which the perfect man Adam forfeited in Eden by sin and rebellion. His death could thus not furnisli the ransom price as the basis for man’s reconciliation to God. (Deut. 19:21) By Satan’s making it appear that Jesus was God, the reasonable mind must conclude that Jesus’ cries upon the tree were a subterfuge, that there was no real purchasing value in his death, and that therefore the whole scheme is unworthy of the consideration of an honest man. The result of that conclusion would be to completely destroy faith in God and faith in the great ransom sacrifice and to blind man to God’s purpose. Jesus was not begotten by a human father, but begotten in the womb of Mary his mother by the holy spirit of God. The Scriptures do not give the details as to how, but the fact is stated that he was begotten by the power of the holy spirit, which is God's invisible power, and that is the end of all controversy.— Matt. 1:18; Luke 1: 34, 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Jesus offered himself in consecration to do his Father’s will he was then and there fulfilling what God’s prophet had before written concerning him, to wit: “Lo. I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, 0 my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.” (Ps. 40:7,8; Hob. 10:5-10) Then and there at Jordan God gave proof of his acceptance of Jesus’ consecration. There was a voice from heaven saying: “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” At that time the spirit of God descended upon Jesus and outward evidence thereof was given. (Matt. 3:1G, 17) The clergy would have the people believe that there stood he who was “God the Son”. The clergy are clearly wrong. Jesus was not “God the Son”, but was and is the Son of God, whom Jehovah God had sent to the earth to perform a great work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The clergy teach that the so-called “holy ghost” is the third person of the “triune god”. The generally accepted thought is that a ghost is a spirit being. The word “ghost” in the Scriptures is mistranslated from the original language of the Bible, to wit, from the root word that is properly translated </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">wind, breath,</span><span class="font3"> in various scriptures. The word “spirit” is properly translated from that root. Its true meaning is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">invisible power.</span><span class="font3"> The spirit of the Lord God is invisible to man and is powerful. It is properly called the “holy spirit” because all power of God is holy. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">holy spirit</span><span class="font3"> (mistranslated “holy ghost”) is not a person or being, and no scripture authorizes the conclusion it is. When God puts his spirit upon a creature that creature is clothed with power and authority to act as the representative or agent of Jehovah God. The holy spirit is not one of the gods of a trinity. It is the holy power of Jehovah God conferred upon his beloved Son and upon others whom He authorized to represent him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The trinitarians say: 'God, Jesus and the Holy Ghost are one, equal in power, in person, and in eternity, and arc three in one.’ Jesus, after being begotten of God’s spirit at his baptism in the Jordan, said: “My Father is greater than I.” (John 14:28) The clergy say: ‘Jesus was his own father.’ They do not tell the truth. The true relationship between God and Jesus is that of Father and Son, and this relationship Jesus always acknowledged. He said: “For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth.”—John 5: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Scriptures testify that God “only hath immortality”. (1 Tim. 6:16) At Jesus’ resurrection from the dead Jehovah God bestowed the gift of immortality upon Christ Jesus. (Rev. 1:18; 1 Cor. 15: 53, 54) That means that when Jesus stood upon the banks of the Jordan he was not immortal, and therefore not equal to God. Jesus’ own words are further proof he was not his own Father, and was not equal in power and eternity with God: “For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; and hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.” (John 5:26,27) Let the people of good will determine whether or not Jesus here told the truth; and if so, then they must conclude that the clergy who teach the trinitarian doctrine are false witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Speaking concerning his sheep, Jesus said: “My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father’s hand. I and my Father are one.” (John 10:29,30) No so-called “third person”, or “holy ghost”, is mentioned here in connection with this oneness, a blasphemous omission if the “holy ghost” were God and equal in power and glory and eternity with Jehovah God. The time came for Jesus to finish his work, and he prayed unto God his Father in heaven; and amongst other things he said to his Father: “Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one [no mention of any ‘holy ghost’].” (John 17:20-22) Here Jesus was praying for those who would believe on him and who should be anointed as member's of “his body, which is the church”. God gave Jesus to be the head over the church, that Jesus and the church “may be one”. This was what he taught the disciples, and this is what afterward the disciples taught. As Christ Jesus is over the church, even so God is over Christ. (1 Cor. 11: 3) Therefore they are all one in organization. The church recognizes Jesus as the head, and Jesus recognizes God as the Head. (Eph. 1:21-23) Thus is proved the complete uniting of God, Christ, and the church. By one invisible power they are united, and therefore are said to be one in spirit. There is complete harmony between God the Father and Christ Jesus the Son of God and the church, the members of his body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Why, then, have the religious racketeers ignored the statements of Jesus and the apostles and seized upon a doctrine which they themselves cannot explain and which no one can understand? and why do they insist on teaching a doctrine that dishonors Jehovah God and destroys the value of Jesus’ great ransom sacrifice? There is but one answer : They are willingly or unwillingly the instruments in the hands of “the god of this world”, Satan, the Devil, who has used them to blind the minds of the people, to prevent the people from understanding Jehovah’s great provision of salvation through Christ Jesus.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BOUNTIFUL PROVISION JEHOVAH IS MAKING</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford :</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is with a heart full of gratitude and appreciation to Jehovah that we make haste to acknowledge our appreciation and love for you in the heat of the battle and the bountiful provision Jehovah is making through His agency, the Watchtower Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Find enclosed an expression of our feelings in a resolution that was unanimously approved by the general assembly of Texas Zone .Number 8, assembled at Ranger, Texas, on May 21, 1939.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RESOLUTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Be it therefore resolved: That Texas Zone Number 8, assembled at our second zone assembly at Ranger, Texas, this 21st day of May, 1939, do move and adopt the following resolution:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. That we heartily co-operate with Jehovah’s visible agency, the Society, in the advancement of Jehovah’s Theocratic Government.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. That we now here renew our consecration and determination to advance the kingdom interests in our zone as never before and that we will put in more time in the service, make more back-calls, as well as see to it that more model studies are started within each of our individual companies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">3. That we greatly appreciate the recent instruction from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> concerning the Achan class, and that, regardless of the representation of the “evil servant” in our zone, we shall go from this place with a burning determination and zeal for Jehovah’s house, to push our part of the “strange work” to a victorious completion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">4. That we, personally and collectively, will see to it, by the grace of Jehovah, that we are delivered from the blood of all people within the confines of this, our Zone Number 8 in Texas. That the people of good will will receive our undivided attention as never before. That we, by the grace of Jehovah, will see to it that we, personally and collectively, are making kingdom interests of paramount importance with greater zeal, which certainly means that everything else must wait.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">5. That, in the drama of vindication, we have definitely located ourselves under the Greater Joshua, our ‘position round about the camp’ (Judges 7: 21) being assuredly Texas Zone Number 8, with the victuals of spiritual food for our strength in battle coming from the bountifully spread table, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> and with the trumpets in our hands heralding the message of the Kingdom and Theocratic Rule, we know that no weapon formed against this invulnerable band shall prosper. We therefore take courage and with increased boldness step out into the field of most intense action, well knowing that we are appearing in the valley before Ai under the command of the Greater Joshua, Christ Jesus, whose forces are invincible. With the invisible forces of Almighty God to our right and the already trembling forces of Satan before us we are certain that the beginning of the Battle of Armageddon is very near; therefore let us this day renew our courage and determination to advance in every department of kingdom service, thus having our assigned part of drawing the forces of Satan out into the open, an action that is certain to hasten the time of their complete exposure and final destruction, vindicating the name of the Most High.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">6. That we shall look neither to the left nor to the right, seeing to it that we cultivate charity for our faithful brethren as never before; that the cords of love divine shall securely bind us together, one compact fighting unit against the numerous cohorts of Satan.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">7. That, with the orders and instructions in our hands, the field of activity definitely before us, the urgent need of more back-calls, more model studies and more time in the service, let us return to our respective companies at the close of this day and lay definite plans to praise the name of Jehovah by raising the number of publishers getting in our 60 hours per month.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">We, Jehovah’s witnesses of Texas Zone Number 8, assembled this 21st day of May, 1939, individually and collectively, realizing the urgent need of increased activity and that the King’s business now requires haste, do therefore move and adopt this resolution by the usual sign of saying “Aye”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FROM FARTHEST NORTH COMPANY OF CANADA</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(Peace River is 500 miles north of the International Line.) </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brethren:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Greetings! It is with great pleasure that the following report is submitted. There was a party of nine that left High Prairie at 9 a.m. on the 7th for Peace River and worked all the towns and hamlets along the road and arrived in Peace River at 6 p.m. We met Brother------, who, by the way, is interested but not yet</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">active in the service. Yet he has a rooming place over his poolroom and he very willingly gave us free access to as many rooms as we required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We had to go to a restaurant that night for supper and for breakfast the following morning. Then we found a lady, though not in the truth, who gave us her home free to use as a cafeteria. Brother Archibald from Belloy met us on Saturday morning, so we went to the wholesalers and got some wholesome food at cost to keep us going until Monday morning. After all the expenses were paid, the contributions exceeded the cost by $10, which was turned over to the Society through the zone servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Report of activities: Publishers, 22; bound books, 9; booklets, 301; subscriptions, 3; hours, 127; attendance, 190; back-calls, 12; public lecture, 39 attendants; service discussion, 38 attendants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We put on an information march at 6: 30 p.m. Saturday, with 28 taking part, the sound-car being used to announce concerning the lecture “Fascism or Freedom” to be given on Sunday evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After supper we assembled in the Orange Hall for a service discussion, 38 being in attendance. Halfway through the discussion in walked two Royal Canadian Mounted Police who had been following us in our march. They stood inside the door on duty, as they were in their full regalia and did not remove their hats. Nothing was divulged while these were present that they should not know. Towards the close of the meeting I drew the attention of the audience to the following, which was chiefly for the benefit of the police: That the Bible is God’s Word of truth and no one such as doctor, preacher, lawyer, or even the police who take their oath on the Bible, can gainsay this. At this point one of the police wished to withdraw, but the other refused to do so. Then I said to the friends, “Are you all familiar with the Order of Trial?” Then attention was drawn to the fact that we are not engaged in selling books, nor are we engaged in any commercial enterprise. That we have charters in both Canada and the United States, and a special one in Quebec, where there are 4,000,000 French people, 90 percent being Roman Catholics. Then I went on to explain that if you were ever picked up by the police for selling books without a license, plead “not guilty” and get one of the friends to go your bail. Then demand a trial and get in touch with the Society for the particulars. Again one of the police wished to leave and the other refused. At the close I asked the friends to rise and thank Jehovah for the privileges we have been given. At this the police doffed their hats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After dismissal the police came up to me, one feeling embarrassed. I said to them I was pleased to see them there. One asked, What is your name? I told him. Where are you from? I answered that also, and asked if we had been reported, and he said, No, we hadn’t. But, he said, we have been commanded to keep watch on meetings of such kind and report the same. So, he then said, we will report having attended this meeting and found everything in order. I invited them to the meeting scheduled for the following day, that is, the lecture “Fascism or Freedom”. (They did not appear.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We had a good assembly and there were seven in all who symbolized their consecration in the Hart river at the edge of town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This letter is being written at Brother Schamehorn’s place. It is as far north as Township 92, where there are 24 hours daylight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Enclosed find declaration signed by all attending the assembly. Yours in the Kingdom service,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. J. </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sutton</span><span class="font3"> (Zone servant)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">DECLARATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We, Jehovah’s witnesses assembled in convention this day at Peace River and brethren as far north as Township 92, declare that we are wholly devoted to Jehovah and his King, Christ Jesus, and even up here we can see the Doom of Religion (Prov. 6:15-19), and we will do our utmost to keep in harmony with Jehovah’s Theocratic arrangement in Zone No. 1, Alberta.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT SIGN WITH TWO BOOKLETS ON</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“We were standing on the street with sign and booklets </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts.</span><span class="font3"> A police officer came and said the sign would have to go off the street. We showed him our Testimony Card and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Liberty to Preach. </span><span class="font3">He replied the sign was not preaching. I said: ‘Oh yes, it is. It advertises the King and the kingdom of Jehovah.’ He: ‘If you do not go I will have to call the patrol wagon and take you in.’ We said we are staying here in obedience to Jehovah’s command. So he made a notation in a notebook and went away. Later the same police came back and said: ‘I reported this to headquarters, and they are investigating it. We will give you till Monday to get off the streets.’ Monday I went back to the same spot. Two or three police passed me and said nothing. Later the same cop came and asked if I was making plenty of money. I replied: ‘Jehovah’s witnesses are not out to make money, but to preach the gospel.’ He laughed and went his way and nothing happened. Saturday we placed 45 booklets, 1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches, </span><span class="font3">and an order for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font3"> (to be delivered Monday), at the same stand. Then we placed 26 booklets and a subscription for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font3"> That sign with the two booklets on it, I placed more booklets with it than ever before.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ANTI-DOORKNOCKING ORDINANCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Marceline, Mo., has an ordinance that one can walk all over a man’s porch and stomp his feet, but don’t knock on his door. A-year ago, while putting out the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cure, </span><span class="font3">the priest became very much offended at what it contained, and the result was that the publishers were arrested, the case still pending in the courts. Sunday three earloads of witnesses went to Marceline, to knock on the doors and tell the people of the good news. We had been working fob some time when out came the marshal and told us to stop knocking on the people’s doors. He was told this was our way of preaching the gospel, and of the Supreme Court’s ruling. He said we would have to stop knocking or he would have to arrest us. We told him to go ahead and start arresting. He saw that wouldn’t work, so he said he would call up the mayor and see what he had to say. About that time a publisher knocked on the mayor’s door and he told her of the city ordinance and if she knocked on any more doors he would call up the marshal and have her arrested. So, between the mayor’s looking for the marshal and the marshal’s looking for the mayor, we got Marceline worked.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BETWEEN AMATEUR RADIOCASTERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“A publisher, an amateur radio fan, was talking to a ‘friend of the air’ across the continent one day and was told that when the friend went out in the woods he felt much closer to God than when he was in church. The publisher took opportunity to witness in regard to religion and the true worship of the Creator, confiding also that he himself would perhaps be an atheist if he had not read some books and booklets on the Scriptures which had been brought to him by people known as Jehovah’s witnesses. ‘Perhaps you have seen some of these people and maybe had a chance to get some of the literature,’ he concluded. ‘Yes,’ was the reply, ‘they come around here quite often. I even take one of their magazines, and say, that reminds me, my subscription has just about run out and I’ll have to have it renewed.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DOWN TO THE SEA IN SHIPS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Corpus Christi, Texas, has a large port, with some 150 to 200 foreign and coastwise ships coming here each month, the large Norwegian and French tankers predominating among the foreign vessels. We aim to witness on every ship that enters our port. Unusual interest has been manifested in this new field, especially by the custom officials and captains of the various ships, by hearing the message themselves and giving us ready access to work all the rest of the members of the ship. To date I have had the privilege of working on 35 ships, and have encountered difficulty only on one, a German tanker, where the first officer asked me to leave, giving me no explanation, but this after I had already made one phonograph setup in German, with a placement of one bound book and a booklet. One French captain, on hearing one of Jehovah’s witnesses was aboard, sent for me, and we had a most enjoyable talk of the Kingdom. He stated that about a month ago an American girl unable to speak French came to their apartment in Paris, introducing the message by a card, and placed </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> with his wife. His wife thought it was the most wonderful message she had ever heard of, and tried to explain some of the details of the book to him. As a result he took everything I had in French, and told me he hoped I would come aboard next trip.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">AS IT APPEARS TO THE ENEMY IN WISCONSIN</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“A man quite excitedly told a woman on whom we are making back-calls: ‘You should have been downtown last night. The whole city was covered with men, women and children wearing signs inviting the people to hear Judge Rutherford in Horace White Park.’ In truth there were only 12 of us, four of whom were children; but we spread evenly over the business district during the busy hour on Saturday evening, and it gave the impression that the city was covered as with locusts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">COMMENT ON AN APPLICATION FOR COMPANY SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“This boy’s family were the most zealous workers in the Baptist church. He was superintendent of the Sunday school and active in all the young people’s societies. Someone told them Judge Rutherford’s books were against the church. So when a pioneer called, the mother politely informed him they didn’t need any of those books; they read the Bible. However, she allowed him to play two records on the phonograph. She would not accept any literature, but after he left she felt curious, so hunted up some old books she had had for some years. She soon saw the books were the truth, and persuaded the rest of the family to read. She began taking </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch forcer</span><span class="font3"> a month later. Soon the whole family pulled out of the church. The neighbors pleaded with them to return. The preacher made a special visit to pray for the ‘erring ones’. They remained steadfast and began circulating literature among their friends The whole family attended the convention in Mobile, took part in the house-to-house witnessing and information marches every day, and had the time of their lives. We discussed the service together last night, and they filled out the application blank. This morning the whole family, father, mother, three boys and two girls were immersed.’’</span></p>
