<p><span class="font10">A Mighty Catholic in the “Pit” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(In Three Parts—</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">J</span><span class="font5">UNE 3, 1939, marked the end of a judicial career. On that date Martin T. Manton, ex-U.S. judge, described by the press as “the highest ranking judicial officer of this country next to the nine Justices of the Supreme Court”, 'the 10th old man/ and a Catholic pre-eminent in church affairs, was found guilty of selling his judicial decisions for monetary consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What follows may seem stranger than fiction, yet true, and in its preparation I was reminded of the words of the Lord JeSus: “And whosoever shall exalt himself, shall be abased”; and of the further words of the psalmist; “Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; . . .he made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.” Thus is foretold in Holy Writ the end of all who presume to plot the downfall of the righteous; and of that the more abundant proof later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">About the crash of Manton, convicted, it is believed, on the first ballot, of “selling justice for cash”, the Catholic press are completely silent. It is amazing that such heralds of Manton’s praise when he held, simultaneously with judicial honors, the Papal “creation” of &quot;Knight of St. Gregor/’; appointment as delegate to the International Eucharistic Congress at Amsterdam in 1924; positions as president of the Catholic Club of New York, president of the Catholic, Club for International Peace, leader of the Knights of Columbus, and contributor of note to various law and Catholic periodicals, are, at this the conviction pf the most honored judge of New York, found wanting in any Catholic comment whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">, Not so reticent as the Hierarchy’s combined news agencies, the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Journal and American,</span><span class="font5"> issue of June 4, 1939, furnishes the following biographical notes on the career of Manton;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1939</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HIGH IX RELIGIOUS AND SOCIAL CIRCLES</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During his years on the bench Judge Manton has become well known in social and religious circles. In July, 1924, he represented the Catholic laymen of the United States in the International Eucharistic Congress in Amsterdam, and he has been president of both the Catholic’ Club and the Catholic Association for International Peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">His distinguished legal record has brought him honorary degrees from such institutions as Fordham University, Manhattan College, New York University and the University of Vermont. [All of which are Catholic.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This silence on the part of the Catholic press is even more amazing to those who take seriously their patriotic fervor and flag-waving. Though allowing the extravagant plenitude of news columns to howding about the dangers to the country of Christian children who choose to serve God rather than give obeisance to a man-made flag; and while blatantly raving about Judge Rutherford as a violator of the Espionage Law which he did not violate; and honoring Manton with all encomium and praise as a great Catholic American who kept eight 'pernicious Russellites’ in prison by denying them the bail which the court has generously allowed to Man ton himself; while in this the Catholic Church papers of America have spared neither space nor vicious epithet, they have overlooked an unusual opportunity to praise the carriage of justice. They blandly pass up a marvelous chance to wave the flag in approval at the conviction of a criminal who dishonored every principle of law and betrayed in vilest manner the trust of the American nation. Now, when the Hierarchy’s press might come forth with salvos for such square and honest'Americans as Attorney General Murphy and “his hard-hitting young prosecutor, U. S. Attorney John T. Cahill’’, and really strike a blow for honesty in office by an editorial decrying the abuses of which Manton was convicted, no Catholic comment is made</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">3</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">on this important matter. When by plain statement they might place the Catholic press among the- patriotic Americans who have a definite preference against their judges’ accepting bribes and doing business in blackmail, their silence is conspicuously noticeable. Can it be that they do not consider it unpatriotic on the part of a Federal judge or any other judge to peddle his decisions and traffic in blackmail when he is a prominent Catholic ? Does it not appear from their noncommittal that, in Catholic usage, “unpatriotic” means simply “critical” of the Roman Catholic Church and is never applied to a loyal son of Romanism, be he perjurer, briber, or thief?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As no adequate answers will ever come from the foremost professional patrioteers of America, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and her publicity agents, other sources will be presented to show the opinion of America generally as regards Manton’s shockingly infamous conduct on the bench. In editorial comment the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Post,</span><span class="font5"> issue of June 5, 1939, states under the title “The Mighty Fall”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Guilty!—of selling judicial decisions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That verdict, convicting Martin T. Manton, resigned senior Justice of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals, is one of the most important events of our times . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. No one knows precisely how many decisions Manton sold from the Federal bench, in exchange for money in the form of “loans”. But the sums run into hundreds of'thousands of dollars, and the trail of intertwined cash and favorable court orders is long and intricate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. . . Manton is the highest ranking judicial officer ever to stand trial in the United States on criminal charges . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Preparation of this case by Murphy’s department, with the help of J. Edgar Hoover, was a magnificent job—and a job almost unbelievably difficult. If Manton hadn’t become careless in his later dealings it is possible that a case never could have been proved against him. . . . Perhaps we need also to get back to the old belief that a seat on the bench is a great honor conferred—and not an opportunity for hitch-hikers on the path of selfaggrandisement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The sincerity of a man’s words is measured, not by the volume of his speech, but by his action when called upon to test out his statements. One of the leading Catholie periodicals has this slogan: “We recommend patriotism and have favored it constantly in our press.” This same periodical, in conformity with all other press agencies of the pope, has nothing to say about the fine and patriotic work of Dewey, Attorney General Murphy, U. S. Prose-eutor Cahill, and Intelligence. Officer Edgar Hoover, for their excellent public, service in bringing an arch criminal to justice. Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As long as Manton accepted bribery and defrauded and dishonored the American nation, thus smirching the flag he had sworn to uphold, and divided the spoils with the Catholie church, all was well. Now that Manton has been exposed and found guilty, his partners in Catholie Action have nothing to say about the triumph of justice; they are as silent as all other gangsters when one of the mob is sentenced to “stir” (which gangster expression means to be incarcerated in the jail). ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It seems that there is nothing too despicable or mean for a man to do when he has the pope’s promise to give him absolution before he commits a crime. It is so simple to decide to do any base action when all you have to do is pay over a few dollars to the pope and he will make a conspiracy with God, and you can go right on in further wicked work, repeating and repeating as long as the “holy father” gets his share. What follows is a highlight on what Manton thought should be done with anyone who committed a misdemeanor without the pope’s O.K.;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In one case, the record shows, Judge Manton sentenced a man to the Federal penitentiary for a year after he was found guilty of selling one-half pint of whiskey to some soldiers.—New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Journal and American</span><span class="font5"> June 4, 1939.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here are some further highlights quoted from the same issue which express the opinion of the judge and prosecutors:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Judge Chbsnut; “This is a case of'supreme import both to the Government and the defendants'. The confidence of the public in the integrity of the courts must not be impaired. . . . Believe 1 ballot convicted Manton. The impression gathered afterwards- was that the jurors both had required only one ballot to reach their decision as to Manton, and that any delay had been caused by a question as to Spector’s guilt.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Cahill; “One of the most monstrous plots to buy and sell justice, in this very Temple of Justice,-was born and hatched within the very four walls of this court house. It was turned into a counting house, where justice and decisions were bought and sold. We must drive the money changers-from the temple. . . . Any judge who accepts gifts or other consideration is not carrying out that oath he swore to. Our citizens would no longer have faith in our courts. . . . There was no more honor among Manton’s group than there would be in a group of common thieves. Man ton did not hesitate to peddle and prostitute the duties of his high court.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">District Attorney Dewey, J. Edgar Hoover,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">chief of the G-men, Attorney General Murphy, and “hard-hitting” Prosecutor Cahill deserved and received high commendation and praise. Did the Roman Catholic press add their plaudits to these men for excellent service? They did not! Evidently cleaning up the foulest sort of corruption that could possibly soil and degrade American courts of justice is not considered patriotic in the Catholic sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One who is bred in the Catholic school &lt;jf bribery never changes his spots. On June 20, and just before Judge Chesnut gave Manton the maximum sentence, it is recorded in the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">World-Telegram</span><span class="font5"> that'—</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For more than an hour Manton pleaded ineffectively for the setting aside of the jury’s verdict, declaring that he had not had a fair trial, that witnesses against him were persons without honor, and that his career had been spotless. . . . Manton winced when he later heard the court’s opinion of his long plea. . . . Judge Chesnut said: “I have not heard this morning any new points that had not heretofore been considered. They should be considered, but do not go to the real merit of the ease on the facts.”</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font5">. The charge</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">Judge Chesnut continued: “What I feel I should say in this ease is intended to be purely in which the verdict of a jury has found to be true is obstructing justice and defrauding the United States of an important governmental function. The maximum penalty is a fine of $10,000 and 2 years imprisonment. In view of the nature of the case the maximum sentence may seem to the public inadequate. The indictment is not based on the federal statute to punish judicial bribery, which provides a penalty of $20,000 and fifteen years in prison. Possibly the government may have elected to try this case on the conspiracy statute because of the greater latitude possible in the submission of evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Viewing the evidence as a whole, my interpretation is this: Here we have a defendant of high personal position and great personal fortune. He found it invested in equities which came under the</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;"><img src="g_E_19390809_files/g_E_19390809-5.png" alt="" style="width:93pt;height:243pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">threat of a financial depression. He violated the most fundamental feature of judicial office—absolute impartiality. He agreed to use the power and influence of his great position to acquire large sums of money to bolster up his failing fortune.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“It is abhorrent- to our conception of public office that a judge should be influenced for the purpose of profit. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“This case has shocked the public, generally, but it has shocked even more the bench and the bar. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“There has been no such conspicuous parallel since Francis Bacon, who was Chancellor of England 300 years ago, was deprived of his office under similar circumstances. Sly sentence is that the defendant Manton shall be remitted to the custody of the Attorney General for imprisonment for two years and for a fine of $10,000.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Manton’s slimy trail stained by the transactions of bartered justice earned him the title of ‘'commercial judge”. His dealings in blackmail involved many wealthy corporations. Of the many shady deals and openly thieving deals, in which Manton acted as chief conspirator, he was actually convicted of receiving $186,000 for six decisions. As a gangster Catholic Manton was really in the big money, Note this explanation of the situation as quoted from the N. Y. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> of June 5, 1939:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The methods Judge Manton was charged with using were almost incredibly brazen. His prosecutor, while not excusing the litigants who made payments to him, points out that many of them were themselves the victims of blackmail. They were told they would have to pay or, if they did not, collections would be made from the other side. “Blackmail was emanating from the Federal court house.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In other words, selling decisions was in itself a little too slow for Manton, so he had a bag man go out and threaten and blackmail the litigants in order to get them in the bag. Here was not the case of a judge who fell from a course of strict honesty through the importunities of a litigant who desired to pay voluntarily for a favorable decision; here was a highway robber on the bench who created his opportunity and solicited by foulest threats, lowering himself beneath the custom of a prostitute who pimps for her hire.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST 9, 1930</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">One of the chief parties to these felonious transactions, namely, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, is for once absent from the 11 ag-wavers, her comment being nil. It seems rather a pity, too, as here would be a rare opportunity to demonstrate altruistic patriotism. The Catholic press might come forward even with the suggestion that, since the “church” has been one of the chief beneficiaries of Man ton’s bountiful gifts, she might at least pay the $10,000 fine to the government and reimburse some of the litigants whom he held up and robbed. Perhaps the Catholic press might take this into consideration and see what could be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However villainous were Manton’s *acts in polluting the courts of justice by reducing them to a blackmail mart, he Vas a chief actor in another and worse conspiracy, not against powerful corporations nor individuals of wealth, but against Christian men standing for principle; and his action in this regard, it seems, had much more to do with his present degradation. Manton’s recent exposure and downfall is an amazing example of the retributive justice the Scriptures emphasize as certain to overtake those who fight against God’s servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This earlier act occurred before many of the readers of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> were born. But the Lord has not forgotten, nor until Manton and all of like stripe have been wiped out will the record be marked “Satisfied” on the books of Heaven. In the stormy years of the World War, when prejudice ^nd passion were at fever pitch, a group of conspirators took advantage of the times to carry into operation a conspiracy to rid the “religious world” of an organization, namely, the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, which was then and still is devoted to telling the people of God’s kingdom. The plot was aimed at Judge Rutherford and seven other officials of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society as the best means of wiping out the publication of Scriptural truths which interfered too. much with “religious practices”. In this conspiracy the Hierarchy’s Manton was a leading actor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “wrong” that these eight Christians committed was this: They acted to uphold the laws of Jehovah by preaching the Bible truths that God’s law forbids Christians, wholly </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">de</span><span class="font5">voted to God, from killing men in unrighteousness. As the religionists of America and their clerical leaders were deeply involved in the bloodshed of the World War by advocating the war from their pulpits, the unanswerable statements from the Bible greatly angered tljem. So the plot was devised to stop the exposure by “getting” Rutherford and others considered leaders in spreading the gospel of God’s kingdom. In this work the Roman Catholic Hierarchy took the lead, and, following their usual custom, advanced the “Protestant” churches and clerics as their pawn while staying behind the scenes, represented, however, by such tools as Manton and others of like ilk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The insidious results are not simply another miserable chapter of judicial prejudice on the part of Manton. The eight Christians above mentioned were tried in the District Court of Eastern New York (the details of which mistrial appear later), and convicted of violation ' of the Espionage Law, and seven of the defendants sentenced to eighty (•) years in the Federal penitentiary. Unlike the generosity allowed Manton by his own trial judge, bail -was refused these men pending hearing on their appeal; and this refusal was made once </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">by Manton himself</span><span class="font5"> without assigned reason.

<p><span class="font5">Why are the details of this conspiracy so vital for the people of America to know now? Because at the present time the clergy of the Catholic system, having no excuse to offer for carrying on their racket, attempt to divert attention from themselves by abusing Judge Rutherford, calling him an ex-convict, well knowing that the reversal of the judgment of the lower court proved him innocent and that he </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">never was a convict.</span><span class="font5"> The clergy caused him to be falsely charged, and now try to take advantage of their own wrongdoing by pointing to his trial in order to shield themselves from exposure.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">THE occasion of the recent visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth to America, and particularly their side trip into the United States, is expected to strengthen the opposition Jo isolation in Congress. Obviously the, tendency of the visit would be to bind the two English-speaking peoples more closely together. That’s why Britain’s statesmen arranged the visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">England, always looking for the main chance, is not averse to using the United States as a good thing; and while Uncle Sam cannot be said to be moved always by altruistic and irreproachable motives, yet in the field of diplomacy John Bull is a past master, while Uncle Sam is a novice at best.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The recent trade treaty between the United States, Canada and England illustrates very well that it is comparatively simple to take things away from a junior, in which class Uncle Sam, despite his adult sobriquet, still finds himself. It all goes to show that in the coming Armageddon, the United States will • not escape the general line-up. While apparently guileless in matters diplomatic, the United States, as much as other nations, is controlled by Mammon. Meanwhile, in the in-' ternational game of monopoly, England for the moment seems to have some interesting advantages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this connection the following comment on the Trade Treaty with England, in the San Francisco </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Examiner,</span><span class="font5"> is worthy of note:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THE TRADE TREATY WITH ENGLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Hull trade treaty between the United States, England and Canada simply comes to this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have delegated our tariff-making power to England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">England now holds in the hollow of her hand the industrial well-being of America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">England’s whole economic aim for 150 years has been to achieve free trade with the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With Secretary Hull’s assistance she has at last gained her end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">AUGUST 6, 1939</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">England is, in fact, legislating for us-—over the heads of our own people and their representatives in Congress, just as she did with Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">England is treating the United States very much as it did Ireland. It seeks to legislate our industries, as it did those of Ireland, out of existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">England at least encountered the opposition of the courageous Irish, while our supine politicians co-operate with England’s attack on our industry and labor, our wealth and our welfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They co-operate by the unconstitutional delegation of powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Constitution of the United States says that &quot;all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only did the American-British-Canadian tariff pact originate outside of the House of Representatives, but very little of it even originated in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It originated in England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was not ratified by the Senate, as the Constitution commands that all treaties shall be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was ratified by Secretary Hull, British Ambassador Sir Ronald Lindsay and Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King, sitting in conference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nothing touches our workers, industrialists and taxpayers closer than tariff duties—but they not only never voted on this Hull-British pact, but they had no say in its preparation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No I England had all the say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Constitution further says that Congress (not England nor the secretary of state) shall &quot;have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Under this administration Congress regulates nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has delegated nearly all its powers to officials who draw up measures in secret and then either mark them </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">‘Must’</span><span class="font5"> for Congressional rubberstamping or they are, a la Hitler, proclaimed to be law by fiat — by and with the consent of England, which is the ease in this recent Hull “treaty”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the late Justice Cardozo said in the decision of the Supreme Court annulling the NRA “this is delegation run riot!” he did not dream that delegation would run to England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is high time that the Supreme Court took up the matter of the constitutionality of all of Mr. Hull’s 19 trade pacts, seeing that the Congress of the United States has abdicated in favor of secret cabals ruled from London.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>America’s Mental Ailment—Fear</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">THE attitude of mind most in evidence in the United States today ■ is one of fear. Particularly fear of the future. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">j<sub>n</sub> the last seven years the term “lack of confidence” in the business world has been printed billions of times in the press. It is assumed that confidence is a cause of business instead of being an effect of business. If confidence is the cause of business, why did the businessmen of this country lose confidence when once they possessed it? As they did in 1929 after they had overflowed with it? Isn’t the answer to be found in the fact that is born of uncertainty and economic helplessness, plus ignorance ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The worker is afraid of the foreman, the foreman is afraid of the superintendent, the “supe&quot; is afraid of the general manager, who likewise is afraid of the boss, the owner, or the board of directors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The latter, in turn, in tens of thousands of cases, are afraid of the banker, and the bankers are afraid of each other. Fear is the dominant note of American business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The small grocery keeper is afraid of the chain store, and the chain store is afraid of adverse legislation. The whole nation is afraid of its towering, mounting debts and does not know what else to do except to go in deeper. ■ The super-patriots are afraid that the Constitution is being violated, and the editors are all afraid of the Communists. The little businessman is afraid of “big business”, and big ' business is afraid of any ideas except those that they are accustomed to. Fear is universal in this &quot;land of the free and the home of the brave’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The rugged individualist is afraid to say what he thinks, and the thoughtful citizen is afraid that he doesn’t think at all, and as a j rule that is true. The great railroad magnates are afraid of receiverships and bankruptcy and also of other forms of transit. The average worker is afraid of being laid off, and the man past 40 is afraid of old age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The conservative is afraid of the growth of radicalism, and. the radical is afraid of what he calls the stupidity of the conservative. The rich citizen is afraid of the kidnaper, and in many eases afraid of his life; hence a bodyguard. The upper world is afraid of the underworld, and the underworld is afraid of the police, and the average policeman’s wife is</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">8</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">afraid that she might be a widow any hour of the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The small businessman (and often the big one) is afraid of the racketeer, and hence sub-niits to blackmail; and the gangster is afraid of his fellow gangsters. That is why they shoot each other in the back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The political economist in college and university is afraid to lay the actual facts of economic science before his students because he is afraid of the regents, and the regents are afraid to tell the truth or permit it to be taught for fear of the effects upon the prospective donations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fear as the chronic mental ailment of the American people is here to stay for “a long, long time”. Its most dreadful form is the fear of poverty, which now is a continuous nightmare to millions of people who never knew its meaning seven years ago. Like Banquo’s ghost, it will not down, and this generation may not see it end. Never in our history have so many power plants, machine shops, huge factories and industrial establishments dotted the land; never so much skill, never so much economic power, not half of it in use. Never, for the average worker, has life been so difficult since we left the frontier behind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fear is the modern Simon Legrec, with his long, cruel whip. The average citizen is sorely confused as to the source of his misfortunes. The pulpit, press, radio, and all of the chan- ‘ ne Is through which accurate economic information might possibly reach .him are choked and barred. He eannot get the facts from any of the popular channels of communication, and the men who control these channels are afraid to discuss the causes of our national misfortunes because any thorough-going discussion of this matter will involve the question of legal privilege. They are afraid of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If this civilization vanishes from the earth, as it may (and if present tendencies are not arrested it will), its disappearance will be due to one disgraceful fact more than any other. It is. the fact of sheer moral cowardice. What an inglorious finish is the realization that the epitaph that will be written on civilization’s gravestone will read like this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Here lies civilization, a victim of suicide; dead, because too cowardly to live.”—Henry H. Hardinge, in “Independent Food Business”. St. Louis </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Star Times.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Airplane Travel at $1 an Hour</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">Railway travel at $1 an hour is quite common. The train travels ■ 50 miles an hour, at 2c a mile ; and there yon are. But airplane travel - at the same rate per hour, and going twice as fast, is something new. But it was done. John M. Jones made a nonstop flight from Los Angeles to New York in 30 hours and 37 minutes at a carefully calculated cost of $30.91. The plane weighed only 650 pounds empty, and there were but four cylinders in the ship. It was the longest trip ever made in so light a plane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">How Would You Explain It?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Howard Hughes and his companions were absent from New York city slightly less than four days in their flight around the world. They were flying so fast towards the sun that each of their days was but nineteen hours long. They saw the sun rise five times in the four days they were away. Now, 'were they four days or five days making the flight? Did they add a day to their lives by flying around the world? What is your answer? What is a day, anyway ?</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Top Speeds for Airplanes</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">. ♦ Top speeds for airplanes are probably indicated by the speed of sound. Sound travels 725 miles per hour at zero, or 850 miles per hour at 60 degrees. When the sound waves tangle the propeller, faster speeds are unlikely. Meantime the aviators complain of loss of consciousness, hemorrhages and partial or complete loss of muscular control at speeds of even 400 miles an hour.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Copping’s Pure Pluck</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">♦ At Seattle, Washington, George Copping had both legs amputated below the knee, and at the time of the amputation asked and was told that his most difficult line of endeavor thereafter would be to operate an airplane. He thereupon began to study.and train for that work, and is now an aviator.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Too Many Crocodiles</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The Imperial Airways flying boat Ceres landed on Lake Dugari, India, because of bad weather, and chanced to find too many crocodiles for comfort. The captain shot two that were too inquisitive and too hungry, and then he and 24 natives towed the boat to deep water and it got away safely without harm to anybody. It was a remarkable experience, and Captain Gurney seemed to live up to the best traditions of British pluck in the hour of danger. The plane was in Lake Dugari eight days.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Berlin to New York and Return</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">♦ It is some satisfaction to Americans to know that the engines of the German plane that flew from Berlin to New York in 24 hours 57 minutes and returned in 19 hours 55 minutes were Pratt and Whitney engines, even though they were actually built in Bavaria under license by the American company.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Practical Use for Autogiro</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The autogiro, which has the ability to go straight up and come straight down, as well as to travel horizontally, is now’ used to transport air mail between the big airport at Camden, N. J., and the post office in Philadelphia. The planes land on the 360-foot roof of the Philadelphia post office.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ It is claimed that by the end of the year 1939 there will be in Europe 700,000 young men, pilots, reserve pilots, mechanics, radio technicians, etc., qualified to go out and blow their fellow men into smithereens in the most approved style.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>The New Bakelite Planes</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">♦ It is claimed that the new bakelite planes can be built twenty to thirty times as fast as those made of other materials, and that the perfect molding of the parts enables the plane to travel at 35 miles an hour greater speed.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>Strength of Air Forces</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Russia has 4,000 first-line planes, Germany 3,500, France 2,500, Great Britain 2,000, Italy 2,000, and Poland 550.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In order to learn as mueli as possible of the life and habits of birds, aluminum bands with certain markings are placed on the legs of many of them. When such birds are found, usually many miles from the place where they were banded, the information, and the band, may be sent to Biological Survey, United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C., to be registered. The Department of the Interior at Ottawa, Canada, also co-operates in this effort. Records indicate that few birds besides sparrows live more than six years.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ Canada has three varieties of phalaropes, or shore birds, all expert swimmers, and in each instance the females are larger, handsomer and wear brighter plumage than the males/ In courtship the female phalarope makes the first advances toward her shy and modest prospective mate. After the poor devil has yielded to her blandishments, and she has laid her eggs, she makes the poor son-of-a-gun sit on the eggs until they are hatched. The male phalaropes just shouldn’t stand for this kind of deal; and here is hoping if any of them read </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> they will be men enough to arise and assert themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ It does not take so long for a robust, hardworking man to eat a pound of honey. Next time you do it you might take a moment to think that the bees flew 40,000 miles to take that nectar out of the heart of flowers, and that if the Creator had not made the flowers, and made the bees, and taught the bees how to gather the nectar and store it for you, you would not have had the honey. Every pound of honey represents millions of flowers; for the bee’s load is only about one one-thousandth of an ounce of nectar on each trip.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The condor keeps its young in its nest for a full year. They do not fly until they are a year old. But the mature condor is a marvelous flyer. Its power over the air is greater than that of the eagle. Its ability to remain motionless in mid-air or to circle about without the flicker of a wing is unequaled. Its wingspread is between and 11 feet.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5">under democratic guise. It is dominated by a small group of reactionary leaders too powerful to be unseated. It is encouraging to observe that the average ex-service man is not now and never has been a member of the American Legion. Through use of stereotypes acceptable to the American middle-class mind, it seeks to prevent democratic change. In the promotion of war and Fascism the American Legion has done more than its share.—William Gellermann, associate professor of Education, Northwestern University.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Making Himself Ridiculous</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Making himself ridiculous, Colonel James A, Moss, president general of the United States Flag Association, published the information that when anybody in the house turns on the radio jmd the persons in the house hear the strains of the “Star Spangled Banner” everybody in the house should stand and uncover. Exceptions stated are that they need not do this if they are eating, telephoning, cooking, playing cards or bathing. So, now, the next time you are pruning your corns, or doctoring a sore toe, or attending to sundry other items of care of your anatomy, if you fail to rise on your toes, throw off the bed covers or what not and remain in an awestruck attitude until the skit is finished, off to the hoosegow with you. Oh, yes, another way would be to shut off the radio. Still another way would he to take the axe and smash the blooming thing, anyway. Or you could write to Mr. Moss and tell him he gives you a pain in the neck. Or you could have the pain in the neck and not say anything about it to anybody. Maybe that would be the best way.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ I will infringe upon your time to tell you why the patriarch Nicolas V did not put a profane hand upon the Lord’s work by destroying Jehovah’s witnesses once for all as they stated in their tracts and announcements that they would do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It seems that this patriarch long ago was enticed by another more lucrative business and, not being contented with his salary of 120 pounds a month and with gifts worth double his salary, he associated himself with a metropolitan bishop and an archimandrite and with three others of the principal of his flock, and all together on a great scale engaged themselves in the smuggling of opium. Their business prospered because the merchandise was hid in the high caps or tiaras of the priests and in the crown of the patriarch. So they were full of joy and as good religionists they were spreading their drug to poison their fellow men. The short trips of the patriarch and Co. were to first find the merchandise and then to dispose of it among the people. Lately Alexandria and Cairo had been flooded with narcotics.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s Kingdom publishers at Rangoon, Burma</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">But the time came and the authorities caught the three of them and, through them and others who were not paid enough in the disposing of the drug, discovered the others. A good many kilograms were found inside the tiara of the representative of the Greek Orthodox church and under the clothes of his retinue. The patriarch said that it did not belong to him but was put there by his companion in travel. These were unhindered in their dirty work: the law forbids anyone to take off their high caps or to search their baggage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Egyptian Government called the ambassador of Greece and entrusted to his care the examination of the patriarch. He in turn insulted the patriarch severely, even calling him “goat priest” because he had exposed to ridicule the whole nation on account of his shameful deed. The same night he was found dead in his bath tub, and the rumor went out that he was self-poisoned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Just before this uncovering of the'patriarch announcement was made in the Greek and the French press that a united effort of all denominations would be put forth to stop all religious propaganda and that this work would be taken up by the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It seems that there is yet a great work ahead of Jehovah’s Kingdom publishers, so that the joyful message may be brought to the other sheep, and they may find food and safety. —L. Psaroudis, Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Persecution of Witnesses in Greece </span><span class="font5">♦ In the past three years many of Jehovah’s people were before the courts in Greece. When released by the magistrates they were rearrested and exiled. Five were exiled from Crete, and one sister was imprisoned three months because she brought a Bible to her brother in the prison—held there for Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a village near Cavala four witnesses were arrested and exiled to the island of Folegrandos. This was done at the instigation of the clergy and one of the “evil servant” class. When the wife of one of these exiles asked the governor to give her an affidavit of poverty, that her husband might get 10 drachmas (13 cents) a day</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">for his support, as they were poor, the governor not only refused to grant her request, but slapped her hard on the face and afterwards boasted of it to a high clergyman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many witnesses were arrested and sentenced to prison for failure to comply with the law that all books must be stamped with the seal of the church authorities of Athens. Books have been seized and destroyed, mail is being watched, and meetings of God’s people must be held clandestinely, if at all.—Aristodemos Frudarakis, '</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Kingdom House, Bradford, Yorkshire, England, is the first pioneer home outside London to be organized in the British Isles. It is situated in an area in which there is a population of more than two million. There are also ten companies of Jehovah’s witnesses closely ‘packed together in this area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The home was completed and commenced work on January 1, 1939, its establishment having been announced the previous October at the zone No. 23 assembly at Leeds. It is large enough to comfortably accommodate thirteen pioneers. These pioneers devote their time to calling upon the people in this area, and working up back-calls among the interested. Their combined field service report for the months of January-, February and March is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Books, 274; booklets, 8,870; peak of publishers, 12; hours, 3,608; average hours, 112.5; attendance, 5,232 ; back-calls, 263.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The sound attendance was achieved entirely by the use of the phonograph, no transcription machine having been used.</span></p><img src="g_E_19390809_files/g_E_19390809-12.png" alt="" style="width:202pt;height:127pt;">

<p><span class="font5">Part of mile march of Jehovah’s Kingdom publishers encircling York Minster, headquarters of archbishop of York</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">On April 23, an assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses living in zone No. 23 was held. York is one of the principal seats of religion in this country. The enormous cathedral. known as York Minster, is one of the best known in this country, the present buildings being traced back to the beginning of the thirteenth century. It was considered fitting that. a mass demonstration against religion should be made by Jehovah’s people on this occasion. Following the afternoon session of the assembly, and at about the time of the close of the afternoon service at the Minster, three hundred of Jehovah’s witnesses, wearing placards announcing &quot;'Religion is a snare and a racket”, marched in a procession more than a mile and a half long to the Minster. The marchers completely surrounded the building, while the people were coming out, filing slowly past the entrance. Clergymen seemed to be in evidence everywhere, and the expressions on their faces showed that they were sorely shocked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When half the column had made a complete circuit, the gates were locked ou us, and the remaining half was compelled to double back. This proved even more effective, as it resulted in a double line passing the main entrance for the second time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The disgust, wrath and indignation of the religionists was clearly shown, one, a canon, angrily approaching one of the marchers. We look forward to the time when this building, together with all others of its kind, will lie in a heap of ruins, as a testimony to Jehovah’s wrath against devil religion.—A. C.

We have had many cases where the people have refused the booklets but after reading the leaflets the husbands have sent their wives running after us for books to get to know more about it. One lady waited half an hour on the pavement last Saturday for me to return and asked for more information concerning the leaflet. I heard tell of one old man taking the leaflet to work and reading it out to his fellow workers and saying it must be true because the actual names and addresses of people were on it. We have had other eases of people waiting for us to come back their way and also running after us returning the leaflet, even throwing it at us, shouting, 'A pack of lies, and you’ll get into trouble over this lot.’ But this course of action has only excited the curiosity of onlookers and given us an opportunity to prove the true statement of facts on the leaflet. Another man said, 'Well, it’s true; I agree wholeheartedly—but my word, I’m afraid there’ll be trouble over it, and I hope you’re prepared for the worst; for you can’t escape.’ ”—W. Kay.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ In a card sent through the mails to a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> subscriber, Albert Mitchell, known as “The Answer Man” of Radio Station WOR, 1440 Broadway, New York, makes the following statement of the conditions now confronting Christian people in the land of their birth unless they become pagans like those who hell Hitler: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Educationally it might possibly be said that Jehovah’s witnesses are persecuted. Since they, in their religion, refuse to salute any object other than God, and since certain school laws require that all students salute the American flag, there have been instances in which children have been removed from school, have been punished, and made to stay after school; have, in other words, been persecuted because they, firm in their belief, have refused to salute the American flag. We have had instances of this before in this country, but as a nation we have always solved the problem, allowing to each the freedom of his beliefs and adjusting our rules of behavior, liberalizing them so that he may stand firm in the faith of his religion and yet remain a good American citizen. The best example of this is in the case of the Quakers, who, because of their religion, cannot swear to anything; and so, today, it is possible for a president of the U. S. not to swear in taking office, but merely to affirm.— Albert Mitchell, '</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ Did you know that I took the Lenten service at the parish church at H---- the other</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Wednesday evening? It came about in this way. In the course of the witness work I called at the vicarage and was asked in by the vicar. We had a long talk, and in the end be took some literature. Then he said to me, “Would you have a talk with my mother next Wednesday on these things?” Of course I readily agreed to do so. The following Wednesday night, therefore, I called at the vicarage and was met by the vicar’s wife, who frostily informed me that he was across at the church. Going there, I was escorted to the front by “His Reverence”, and then the vicar said to me, “1 will give you a quarter of an hour to address the congregation; if the bishop knew, I should get the sack,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then I saw it all. I had been mistaken. I was not to speak to his mother, but to the mothers’ meeting and their friends, men included. Imagine my feelings; for I had never spoken in public before. Then I remembered the scripture, “I have put my words in thy mouth.” So, standing up, I said, “Erlends, I am more used to speaking to you at your doors concerning God’s kingdom”; and that helped me. For fifteen minutes I told them of the truth, of the unfaithfulness of the clergy, and of the unseriptural doctrines taught by men. Meantime the vicar’s wife was looking daggers at me. When I had finished, the vicar said, “Well, our speaker evidently means that we should get back to the Bible; and I must say I agree with her.”—As told by a witness to F.

<p><span class="font5">♦ The events here set forth took place before the Anschluss (Austria’s union with Germany).</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Tn an Austrian village lived a young married couple and their little boy. The parents were zealous witnesses of Jehovah. The villagers, incited by the local priest, manifested continual haired towards these preachers of righteousness, treating them as enemies and infidels. Then a sudden blow befell the young couple: their little two-year-old son died.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Instead of showing sympathy to the bereaved parents, this sad loss merely provided the clergy with a further opportunity to show their ill-will. They declared that the child was a little heathen, and denied the parents the right to bury their baby in their sq-ealled “consecrated Christian cemetery”. The ■ funeral undertakers,'at the instigation of the clergy, also refused their assistance, so that the parents had to carry their dead infant from their home to the cemetery, an hour’s journey, and then had to bury him themselves outside the cemetery wall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Shortly after, the grave was ornamented with a large headstone on which the father, an artist of some skill, had painted a beautiful sunny landscape. In the foreground qf the scene, bathed in sunlight, was his little boy in the middle of a flower-spangled meadow, and underneath were the following words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Death is the great enemy of the human race. The dread it inspires would hasten our end, were we unaware that Christ died to redeem mankind from the tomb. Behold the time is coming when those who are in the grave shall hear the voice of the Savior, and shall return to the earth as human creatures, and enjoy God’s glorious sunshine. He who has given this promise is faithful. He will lay the foundations of a new earth wherein shall dwell righteousness. You also, our little Fridolin, will come back* and we will sing together songs of praise to Jehovah, the great Life-giver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And now the grave of the little child, once despised as a heathen, has become an attraction. From far and near people come to look at the beautiful picture, and to read the moving epitaph, the language of which, all can see, is far from that of an ungodly man. Numerous are the inquirers who then go and ask the parents of little Fridolin the precise meaning of those remarkable resurrection promises engraved on their little one’s tombstone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And so the parents have the joy of explain ing to these inquiring souls, hungering and thirsting for truth, the precious Scriptural promises, and of showing from the Bible that before long Christ will destroy religion and religious practitioners, and will reign over the earth, instead of the Devil, giving life to the righteous.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark94"></a>State vs. Jehovah</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HL early settlers of America sincerely trusted in Jehovah God. The rulers of European countries under the influence of the Devil made it impossible for the people to freely worship God, and the result was that the sincere men who could escape fled to the wilds of America and there founded a nation where they might worship God in freedom and according to their own conscience and without fear or hindrance. The principles of freedom of worship were embodied in the fundamental law of the new land of America. For years thereafter the legislative and judicial departments of the government put Almighty God </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">His Word above the state, and when a law was proposed or was enacted which was contrary to the Word of Almighty God, that law was declared by the courts to be- void and of none effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since 1918, which date marks the end of the World War, the woes upon the nations, including America, have greatly increased, and such is exactly as foretold by the Lord concerning this time, and the reason therefor is given in these words: “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because .he knoweth that he hath but a short time.<sup>1</sup>’ —Revelation 12:12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The nations of Europe, which have professed to serve God, have fallen entirely away from God. Cruel and arbitrary dictators have taken over the control of Europe. Freedom of worship of Almighty God is denied the people by such dictators. All of such totalitarian governments put the State, or government, above Jehovah God and command all the people to obey the state even though obedience to the state laws requires them to violate God’s law. It is Satan, the god of this wicked world, who has instilled in the minds of such dictators the demand to put the state above Jehovah God. Satan knows that his time is short, and he is determined to plunge all the nations into destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the United States, at one time the boasted land of freedom, the ruling powers are now moving along the same course of European dictators. This is due to the religious influence particularly exercised from the Vatican. Freedom of worship is denied the people. Laws are enacted compelling the observance of certain religious formalism and which practice is in violation of God’s law. When the question is raised that the law under consideration is in violation of God’s law, judges of the courts hold, contrary to what judicial decisions formerly held and decided, that the people must yield to the state. They make no distinction between religion and Christianity, and since religious leaders follow and obey the state in preference to the Lord God, both the politicians and the leading religionists put the state above or superior to the Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Centuries ago Jehovah gave to his devoted people his law to safeguard them from the Devil influence, and therefore commanded that they should not bow down to or worship any thing or creature, because the same would be idolatry and against God. The covenant people of Jehovah, the Israelites, were later carried away to foreign lands, and there were required tb salute and bow down to and give obeisance to a thing created by the state. Some of those faithful Jews refused to obey that law of the state, and were cast into a fiery furnace, as a punishment, but the power of Almighty God protected them and they came forth from the furnace without harm. (Daniel 3:1-28) That was a striking example of how God protects those that trust in Him and refuse to yield to the devil religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In America, where Fascism or totalitarian rule is rapidly coming to the fore, fanatical religionists attempt to compel school children who believe in God and in Christ to salute the flag and sing so-called “patriotic songs” and thus give worship to a thing and obeisance to a creature or thing. Such is a violation of God’s law; and when the nation insists that such law of the land must be obeyed regardless of one’s faith in God, that nation is putting the state above Jehovah God. Beyond any question of doubt the practice of compulsory flag-saluting shows that many of the states of America, and the nations, are now putting the state above Jehovah God. Thus America takes her place amongst those nations which have forgotten God. And what shall be the result! “The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.”—Psalm 9: 17, Those who believe in Jehovah God and trust </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font5"> implicitly in Him know what will be the final result. When confronted with the law of the state the obedience to which would compel one to violate God’s law, Christians who truly follow the Lord Jesus Christ say, as did the faithful men of old and the early apostles: ‘We will obey God rather than men? (Acts 5: 29) ‘The God whom we serve is able to deliver us? (Daniel 3:17) The practice of putting, the state above Jehovah is another evidence of the fulfillment of prophecy, showing that the day of Armageddon is just at hand.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ What life under a dictator is like may be judged from the fact that a Berlin court sentenced an employer to a fine of $400 because he increased the pay of his staff without consulting the authorities, and the threat made to a girl who was forced to take a government job. The girl stated that she did not wish to accept the job, because she was to be married </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">three weeks; whereupon she was told that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">her </span><span class="font5">reluctance to obey orders made her liable to a sentence of six months in prison, and the confiscation of her labor book, which would render it impossible for her to obtain a new job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Greatest Display of Might</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ What is declared to have been the greatest display of might ever shown took place in Berlin on Hitler’s fiftieth birthday when the Via Triumphalis was the scene of a great automobile parade, four cars wide, six men to a car, all ready for war, and the ears as close together as they could move. This style of parade replaces the old one of marching men, which always resulted in many casualties.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark100"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark101"></a>The Horrors of Buchenwald</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The horrors of Buchenwald are told by a copyrighted article in the Manchester (England) </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Dispatch,</span><span class="font5"> from the pen of Hans-juTgen Koehler, Gestapo agent, sent there as a prisoner, to obtain information regarding certain papers. What he saw finished his interest in the Reich and its devilish ruler. Men were compelled to run up hill with logs and blocks of stone so heavy that it required several other men to lift their burdens upon their shoulders. If he could not keep the pace he was “shot while trying' to escape”. In four weeks 80 out of 2,000 new prisoners died. It was considered a good joke by the guards to get a prisoner to go near enough to the danger line that be could be machine-gunned in his tracks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Unpleasant Pleasantries of der Fuehrer </span><span class="font5">♦ Some time last year the American Government seized $10,500 worth of German goods for violation of customs regulations. A few weeks later an American shipmaster was about to sail from &amp;&nbsp;German port, with a cargo of wood pulp for the United States, when he was arrested for a series of alleged violation of Nazi laws, fined exactly $10,500, and when he could not pay it, Uh all the property he had in the world was his ship,, the ship was seized, cargo and all; and thus der Fuhrer gained one more of the victories that make him loved by all decent men. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Haus mit ihm!</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ It is singular that within a few days almost a thousand young men from East Prussia concluded they would like to visit Danzig. Some wore Storm Troopers’ uniforms, and it was remarked that a similar flood of tourists visited Sudeten I and. just before the Czechoslovakian republic was carved up. Polish papers claimed that the population of Danzig was increased by 30,000 Germans, most of them Storm Troopers.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark105"></a>Not a Health Magazine</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Do not make the error of thinking that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> 13 a health magazine. It has no such aspirations. If you overload your system * ~ with starches and with meat, use tobacco, drink liquor, tea and coffee, speak and think evil, avoid hard work and the drinking of pure water, and are careless about your bowel habits, you would do well to subscribe for some health magazine; you are in a fair way to get some one of the 1,170 “diseases” and to realize your need of a “cure”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Glancing over a big pile of articles on how to cure this or that, one comes across a few ideas that seem to have some common sense to them. Here they are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some people wear themselves out talking (when a phonograph would do it better). When a man speaks he uses eighteen muscles and thirty-three nerves and deposits much earbon-dioxide and other waste products into his blood stream, in the exertion of talking. To eliminate the waste caused by ten minutes’ talk forty-five minutes of normal quiet life is needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Don’t expect too much of drugs. A prescription for hydrophobia recommended by the New York legislature in 1819 was described as follows: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One ounce of jawbone of a dog burned and pulverized to a fine dust, the false tongue of a newly foaled colt, also dried and pulverized, and measures of verdigris, which is raised on old copper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Don’t be too alarmed about the soft yeastlike growth which may appear on your tongue. This rises and falls with the state of the digestive system. Maybe all you need is plenty of fruit, plenty of water and plenty of work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Puerto Rico the houses have no windows and rickets is almost unknown; the natural result is that what children who have rickets need is plenty of sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Emotional states affect the juices of the stomach and bowels; so don’t eat when you are distressed or excited. Calm yourself; the world will be here after your troubles are for ever over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Wounds exposed to sunshine heal rapidly. Don’t get disturbed because you sweat. Sweating is not injurious; it is beneficial. Powder to stop sweating is injurious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That’s all for now. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark106"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark107"></a>Universal Medical Examination</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The danger of such universal medical examination as the health commissioner pleads for is that it would transform innumerable happy and to all intents and. purposes healthy persons into melancholy watchers of their own symptoms, who would never again dare to exert themselves hopefully and eagerly in the business of life. So far from prolonging life, imparting such dire knowledge of themselves to people would be the means of shortening their term and of limiting their happiness and . their usefulness. A healthy mental attitude is the greatest of all helps in preserving physical sanity. Break down a healthy mental attitude and the baleful germs that are in all of us will riot uncontrolled. . . . Virtually all of us go through life with engines that are more or less imperfect, but that do their work satisfactorily enough so long as we do not watch them, tinker over them and fuss with them. -A compulsory universal medical examination would probably result in widespread depression and despair.—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Youth's Companion.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ Flexible boards, four feet wide, ten .feet long, and one-eighth of an inch thick, can now be had, and can be curved with the grain to form a column as small as six inches diameter. Improvements in wood-work ing machinery have resulted in new types of floors and walls, very attractive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark114"></a>Pagan Nonsense at Vatican City</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Stripped of its symbolism a crown, after all, is merely a hat, and so it seems a little silly that it took four hours for Pope Pius XII to get his hat on straight. All the rest of it, from start to finish, was absolute folly. Some of the stories of the attendance at that four-hour exhibition of foolishness stated that 500,000 persons witnessed the ceremony (the Washington </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font5"> made it 350,000), and then some intelligent newspaperman (and there are a few such, after all) made geometrical and arithmetical calculations which proved that at three persons to the square yard, and counting 5,000 people in the windows, not more than 125,000 persons could by any possibility have seen it at all. Many fainted, and one woman died while the four-hour show was on. Some of the main features of the exhibition of idolatry and vanity are given in the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> as follows. A good joke on somebody is the statement that 'Peter, the first Pope, suffered under Pharaoh'. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> is out of whack on its history only a trifle of some 1,500-odd years. But why worry about a little thing like that? The important thing is to see what the girls wore and who and what they kissed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">columns of piffle, about- that pagan ceremony, which </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">following </span><span class="font5">columns did not once mention the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Scriptures, the following are select' ed as the most outstanding items</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&lt;rf public interest:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Swiss Guards were in orange and yellow, the Gold Noble Guards in red tunics and white knee breeches, the choristers in violet, the Monsignori in purple, the Cardinals in vermilion and ermine, the friars in brown and the priests in black.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On either side of and slightly above the Pope’s head were two semicircular ostrich feather fans. These, perhaps, recalled to many minds that similar fans used to be carried in the procession of the Pharaoh under whose reign St. Peter, the first Pope, suffered martyrdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Pope wore his full pontifical vestments, but they were completely hidden from sight by his enormous cope, richly embroidered in gold, which was so long and ample that it covered most of the floor of the sedia gestatoria. On his head was a silver miter studded with jewels. His hands were covered with white gloves and on the third finger of the right hand the Fisherman’s Ring, emblem of Papal authority, could be seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Before the papal court came six maee-bearers in black doublet and hose with white lace at their wrists, violet capes and rapiers hanging from their belts. On either side was a single row of Swiss Guards—representing the Catholic Cantons of Switzerland—carrying long serpentine swords with heavy hilts resting on their shoulders and the points Sticking straight up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With them walked the commander of the Swiss Guard, Colonel de Sury d’Aspremont, resplendent with shining breastplate and plumed helmet, and officers of the Noble Guard in scarlet tunics with golden epaulets, burnished helmets with long black horsehair plumes and black and white egrets, buckskin breeches and top boots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The procession advanced by twos in the following order: Two masters of ceremonies in clerical garb, flanked by two Swiss Guards; the Apostolic Preacher and Confessor of the Apostolic Family, also in clerical garb; the procurators general of various religious orders, among whom were noticeable the black tunics and hoods of the Benedictines, white tunics and hoods of the Dominicans, brown tunics, cord belts and sandals of the Franciscans, brown tunics and white mantles of the Carmelites and black gowns of the Jesuits; a dozen bus so! anti in red frock coats, knee breeches and shoes of the same color; the jeweler of the-apostolic palaces in doublet and hose carrying upon a cushion the precious triregnum with which Pope Pius IX was crowned, flanked by two Swiss Guards; a number of chaplains in red cassocks and ermine capes carrying the Pope’s precious miters on cushions; two apostolic cursors in black breeches and violet capes carrying silver maces; a number of chaplains, privy clerics and privy chaplains in red robes anti ermine capes; a group of consistorial advocates in purple capes and ermine; a number of ecclesiastical officials in surplices and rochets; two privy chamberlains in red robes and ermine capes carrying the Pope’s usual miters; Prince Alessandro Ruspoli, Master of the Holy Hospice, in medieval costume, and the Auditor of the Tribunal of Rota carrying a crucifix mounted on a silver wand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After the preliminary part of the procession came the penitentiaries of St. Peter’s in chasubles of white damask and white birettas, carrying long silver wands rising from bouquets symbolizing punishment and clemency. Then came a score of mitered Abbots in white cloaks decorated with gold, wearing miters of white cloth, and a full hundred Bishops with cloaks of silver lame decorated with gold and wearing miters of white cloth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mingling with the Pope’s ecclesiastical privy chamberlains, with the two principal masters of ceremonies in violet cassocks, surplices and rochets, and with the three Cardinals, who were to assist </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">Pope to celebrate the mass, in cloaks of silver lame over vermilion robes, were gentlemen of the princely houses of Rome who occupy the highest posts of honor in the Vatican court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Cardinals, after prostrating themselves before him, kissed his foot and hand and received the double embrace in return. The Patriarch Archbishops and Bishops kissed his foot and knee and the mitered Abbots kissed only his foot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Leave having been granted, the Pope’s foot was kissed again by Mgr. Nardone and then by the canons, beneficiaries, choristers and clerics of the basilica, as well by students of the Vatican Seminary.</span></p>

It has never yet been officially decided whether they know how<sup>7</sup> to figure or not. But here are some facts. There are supposed to be 300,000,000 Catholics in the world. The Catholic Church claims Peter was the first pope and got away to a good start. Very well, be generous.- say that the</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Catholic Church has been in existence 19 centuries; that the average number in existence continuously was 150,000,000, and that there were 57 generations in the 19 centuries. The total number of Catholics that have lived would therefore amount to 8,550,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pope Pius XI made a record as a pope. He <sup>f</sup>beatified” 42 and ’‘sanctified” 30 in 10 years’ time. 72 in 10 years would mean 13,680 Roman Catholic “saints” in 1900 years; i.e., if each of the other popes had been as generous in making “saints” as he was. All O.K. That is one “saint” out of each 625,000 Catholics in 19 centuries. What about the other 624,999 Catholics that have Jived and died along with their “sainted” brother or sister? They are still “cooking in purgatory”. When will they get out? Well, one of them got out in 1,900 years. Give the others a break, equally good, and each one of this first lot will be cooked through and ready for the table in 624,999 times 1,900 years. That totals up to 1,1.87,498,-10Q years. There are plenty of people who, if they had cooked that long, would forget what it was all about, and would not care to see the head cook, no matter where he lived.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ Sane man enters insane asylum, hopeless ward. First inmate greets him and says, “I am glad you came to see me. I am George Washington, and everybody should come and greet the father of his country.” Sane man replies, “Pardon me, my friend, but you are twisted on your pedestal. George has been dead 139 years.” Second inmate says, “I am Napoleon. You have done well in coming in to honor the greatest military man that ever lived.” Sane man replies, “You? Napoleon? Kind sir, you will pardon me, but you have bats in your belfry. The real Napoleon, the incarnation of force and murder, is buried over in Paris, and 1 am glad he is.” Third inmate says, “I am Jesus Christ. All should be glad to bow at my feet. Get down and do your stuff. Kiss my big toe.” Sane man replies, “Not on your tintype. I have more important business than kissing the toes or rings of people that have gone nuts.” How far would the sane man get down the corridor? , The moral to this little tale 'is that Satan’s organization is insane. AH its devotees are insane, and that includes Mr. Pacelli, who now thinks, or tries to think, that he is the Vicar of Jesus Christ. Today the only sane in the entile world are the Christians, of whom there are but few. To the insane, these sane persons seem peculiar and hateful, and worthy of death, because they refuse to do all the insane things that others love to do, and because they are engaged in a strange work of proclaiming the coining end of the insane asylum.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark119"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark120"></a>A Problem in Mathematics</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The Washington </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font5"> contained two columns of drivel about the Papal coronation. Following the usual newspaper style of piffle it stated that ''‘500,000 souls had dropped on their knees” in a. space that more careful newspapermen had figured only 125,000 could stand in, and then eight paragraphs farther on it stated that “from 300,000 throats rose the roar of acclamation”. Here is a problem for the mathematicians which may be expressed somewhat as follows: “If 500,000 souls drop on their knees in a space where only 125,000.can stand, and are so affected that only 300,000 of their 125,000 could roar, what were the 375,000 doing that led them to fall on their knees in a place where they had no room to stand, and why was it that 200,000 of them that did not get into the 125,000 space never so much as gave a squawk, let alone a roar, when their comrades, 175,000, who also could not get into the space,.gave that roar?” That ought to be plain. What is the answer?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">News Chrobiicle</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Bit</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The London </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">News Chronicle</span><span class="font5"> is away above the average newspaper, but it also got bit on the story from Rome when it said tn a headline, “Afore than 500,000 people saw Pope Pius XII crowned in Rome today.” It was a real reporter that figured out only 125,000 people could possibly be crowded into the space where the “more than 500,000” are alleged to have witnessed the four-hour ceremony. The Leicester </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Mail</span><span class="font5"> got stung only a little less badly; for it prophesied in a headline that “500,000 will see Pope’s coronation”. Even the Manchester </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span><span class="font5"> got burned, its expression being “Alore than half a million people, packed in the square below' and between there and the Tiber, on Sunday saw' Pojjb Pius XII being crowned Pope on the outride balcony of St. Peter’s”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ On Hitler's fiftieth birthday all the churches in Berlin, including the Catholic churches, flew' the swastika, yet it was only a year or so prior to that time that Pope Pius XI had much to say about the heathen swastika cross flying in the face of what he called “the Christian Cross”, in Rome.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark125"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark126"></a>Vienna’s Religion Tax</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Up until 1939 persons not having the Catholic religion in Vienna had to pay a religion tax. which was used to help pay the wages of Roman Catholic priests, but Catholics themselves did not have to pay this tax. The priests held them up in the regular manner, as in the United States and Britain, for all they could gel out of them, for “services” performed at weddings, christenings,* funerals, masses and other rites. As cash is low in the new Germany, it was announced some time ago that hereafter Catholics would also have to chip in on the religion tax, but later reports are that this is put off until 1940 ■ which shows <sup>: </sup>the close relation between the Hierarchy and the Nazi authorities.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark127"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark128"></a>Which Country Is It?</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Which country is it that makes its national bank unconditionally subject to the state? Which country is it that makes the officer corps of the army merely an arm of the single legal party? Which country is it that handles its exports and imports by a single government agency? Which country is it that tolerates no strike or other interruption of national production? Is It Russia or is it Germany? It is both. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ A bronze statue 13 feet tall has been erected in AJoscow in honor of Pavlik Morozoff, a Russian boy who betrayed his father to the Bolshevik authorities. The boy’s father killed Pavlik, and then the boy’s father and his friends were slain. The whole thing is reminiscent of the days of the Inquisition and shows what may be expected in any land under totalitarian rule.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">♦ The Jesuit Bulletin,</span><span class="font5"> on the last page of its April (1939) issue, asks the question, “Why should the Jesuits give themselves to the study of earthquakes?” On page 5 of the same issue it gives several answers, and it seems as if the real answer may be found in the last clause of the following summary:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Finally, much that is now known about the structure of the interior of the earth has been learned from the records of these disturbances, with the result that the methods of seismology are being used with great success in discovering oil and mineral deposits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Mary’s Day—Mother’s Day &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mary’s Day and Mother’s Day have the same origin. Both arc in-tended to glorify creatures, Mary was a creature, the same as other '‘ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ mothers. In no sense was she either</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the “Mother of God” or the “Mother of Mankind”. She was honored and blessed by being the earthly means by which Jesus of Nazareth was born of the flesh. A suggestion of Catholic theologians is that Catholics, once a year, make an “offering in Mary’s name, equal at least in value to that presented to mother on Mother’s Day”. It is merely one more of the countless methods used to try to wring money from the workers to maintain the racket.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rain Water Sins Are Forgiven</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Some idea of the pure punk peddled in the name of religion is obtainable from the collection of ecclesiastical nonsense known as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Register.</span><span class="font5"> A person wrote in, asking, “If a person, while walking to church, swallows a drop or two of rain water, may he receive communion ?” The satellite of the Roman Hierarchy running </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Register</span><span class="font5"> came back with this, “If a person unintentionally swallows a few drops of water together with saliva, he is not considered to be breaking his fast.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ There is little choice between things that are rotten, and any and every totalitarian state is just that. In Russia, for example, the G.P.U. awakened a ten-year-old boy at midnight and as a result of its processes he ‘confessed’, “I was a member of a counter-revolutionary, Fascist organization.” If Russia can get confessions like that out of, kids that are only ten years old, the next logical step is to try it out on those half that age, or as soon as they can talk plain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ Under the international Ku Klux kode, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">country can be invaded merely because it is ‘discourteous’ or entertains thoughts that are distasteful to the aggressor. Countries may be overrun, territory taken, property destroyed and people killed by the hundreds of thousands in the name of civilization or religion, with never a declaration of war uttered, Legal-istieally speaking, the world may be at peace while helpless populations are put to the sword. The kleagles and the klokards now ride bombers, tanks, battleships and submarines over a field of operations that is international. The raids of the nightshirt nations constitute the greatest threat to civilization since the democratic principle became established.— Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes, in an address at the annual meeting of the American Civil Liberties Union.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark139"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark140"></a>Liberty with Jaws Clamped Shut</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Liberty with her jaws clamped shut. Liberty knocked senseless if she dares open her head to tell the truth. Liberty strangled and buried if she has the hardihood to uncover the Italian racket operating out of Vatican City. That is the Papal standard. ThaJ is what the pope meant when he sent word to the convocation of Catholic gangsters at Washington that Catholics necessarily are defenders of “true human liberties”. He did not dare leave out the word “true”. It is his alibi. When the showdown comes he will say, as always, that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">true</span><span class="font5"> human liberties are the liberties of the Catholic Hierarchy to perpetuate their blasphemies and lies. No other liberties are </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">true, </span><span class="font5">and hence no other liberties may be or should be defended. It is all so simple. Just like that.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark141"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark142"></a>Uncle Sam in Hard Luck</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Uncle Sam is in for hard luck. On the same day the newspapers contained the information that plans were being considered at the headquarters of the Italian Camorra in Vatican City to put the army and navy of the United States (so far as possible) under the control of a full-time bishop, the same as is done in Germany, Italy, France and other countries under Papal control, they also reported that Joseph P. Kennedy, Roman Catholic ambassador ,to Britain (but on Uncle Sam’s pay roll), would be the official representative of the president (not the people) of the United States at the coronation of fius XII. (That is when the “crown of heaven, earth and hell”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">was placed on </span><span class="font5">Paeelli’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">head, </span><span class="font5">making him what he is today.) Kennedy is the only Roman Catholic to have the post at the Court of St. James’s, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">it is the first time a president of the United States was ever “officially” represented at such </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font5">affair, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font5">third item was that Pius </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">XII </span><span class="font5">officially “blessed” the United States (whether they wanted to be blessed or not, less than onesixth being Roman Catholics). Inasmuch as history shows that the Papal “blessing” usually works out to the reverse, it looks like hard luck ahead for Uncle Sam, officially.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark143"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark144"></a>Saluting the Stars and Stripes</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">♦ In Russia, we understand, it is obligatory to make the motions and mouth the sentiments prescribed by stern authority for showing loyalty to the revolution and Soviet Communism. The same is true concerning the forms for showing abject submission to Fascism in Italy, to Nazism </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">Germany. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font5">fact, it is distinctly dangerous in those states to omit, even inadvertently, the slightest of the required ceremonials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But the United States is not totalitarian— not yet, at least. The Stars and Stripes still stands for the “sweet land of liberty”, still waves over the land of the free and the home of the brave. So let’s forego trying to force persons to make formal salutes of the flag which stands primarily for freedom. Let’s forbear jailing them or putting them out of schools and societies because of their idiosyncrasies in the name of conscience, no matter what vagaries their acts may seem to others of us to be. Let’s even desist from knocking hats </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">off </span><span class="font5">goofs with their hands in their pockets and gawking at parades in which the flag passes by. —The Portland </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Oregonian.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ I have long thought that the eases are not different from the “shrine” eases in Korea, which are matters of supreme concern to every board of foreign missions; the subject of much discussion in the American church, Roman Catholic and Protestant, and are beginning to result in violent action by the Japanese and in martyrdom by the Koreans. The Japanese say that there is no religious significance in the ceremony at the shrine of the emperor; the Korean Christians say that it is a religious ceremony. So the Romans said to Polycarp in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A.D. </span><span class="font5">155 before they executed him because he refused to engage in the ceremony at the bust of Caesar, which the Romans said was not </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">religious ceremony.-—V. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">H. </span><span class="font5">Lukens, New </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jer</span><span class="font5">sey, in the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Herald Tribune.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark146"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark147"></a>Forget Flag Ordinance</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Tacoma’s city council has gone about </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">far </span><span class="font5">enough with the proposed flag ordinance. Now would be a good time to lay it on the table and forget it. Forget it, not because it was considered by some an invasion of civil liberties. Forget it, not because some elements of union labor feared it would be used against pickets during strike. Forget it, not because good citizens or three persons in a street corner argument might be inconvenienced. But sidetrack it now because its purpose is not clear to all and because it represents a prohibition impossible of practical enforcement. Grant that the women who first proposed its passage were women inspired by patriotic intent, the ordinance is unsound in that it cannot legislate the state of persons’ minds. Patriotism, love of country and of its flag, is a thing of the mind. Mere waving of a flag or display of it by groups in public places, in meetings and parades will not instill patriotism in a mind that does not sense patriotism in the natural order of affairs. If there is a place where men and women congregate to plot sedition and treason and overthrow of American government by force and violence, then that is no place for the Stars and Stripes—and there are state and federal laws to deal with them. The city council has a wild bear by the tail and should let go.—Tacoma (Wash.) </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">News Tribune.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark148"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark149"></a>Let’s Get It Settled</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">♦ For consistency’s sake—if no other reason —we wish the courts of the land would get together on whether a public school pupil can be compelled to salute the flag against conscientious scruples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The courts differ—what is right in Jersey is wrong in Florida and California. Most Americans will think that belief a flag salute is idolatry is silly. Perhaps it is. But the contradictory opinions of the courts on so simple a question are equally as silly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why not let the children believe what they want? Their love of country has not been otherwise questioned. Perhaps they love what the flag stands for as much as some who salute it but do not hesitate to violate the laws and traditions for which it stands.—Miami </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Herald.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Fascist-Nazi idea of free Speech is that everybody should be privileged to express himself freely ' provided he says only that with which the totalitarian regime is in agreement. The anti-totalitarian is not permitted to speak at all in totalitarian lands like Germany, Russia, Italy or Spain, but, note the contrast, in New York city 20,000 Nazi sympathizers were allowed to meet in Madison Square Garden, and when Isadore Greenbaum attempted to assault one of the speakers for anti-Semitic invectives, he had his trousers pulled off and was sentenced to ten days in the cooler.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ You heard about circulating libraries all your lives. The idea is that the books circulate from one to another. New York city has one in which not only the books circulate but the library itself docs. The Queens Borough Public Library carries 1,000 books to twenty communities in Queens at least once every week. Three librarians and'a driver constitute the staff. Heaters are provided in winter, and fans in summer. The stops are at the public schools, and are at the curb, so that children can borrow and return books in safety.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ Pronounced dead, as a result of a violent attack of asthma, Mrs. Bella Futterman, of New York, had no pulse, no heart action, was absolutely cold, mouth was drawn, and there was every appearance of death. However, she was resuscitated, and her only impression was that she had had a quiet, peaceful and happy sleep; and that is all there was to it, and all there is to it. Death is death, unconsciousness, just as the Scriptures declare.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ On a day recently a section of Brooklyn was treated to a roaring sound that created much discomfort and intense interest.

The sound waves hit against an atmospheric sound shell in the heavens and were largely focused at one point a mile away, where the people almost thought the world was coming to an end, literally.</span></p>

Now, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font5">doubt, her loving parents believe she is roasting in “purgatory” and thus, at least, has some of the heat they denied her in her last moments.

<p><span class="font5">♦ Maybe you know why holly is used at “Christmas” time, and that’ there are “he” holly (or “holy”) trees and “she” holly (or “holy”) trees. It is a superstition taken over from old Pagan Rome. The “ho” holly trees, the ones with the prickly leaves, were used in divination, fortune telling. The girl who wanted to know<sup>7</sup> her fortune counted the prickles, one after the other, to see if she would be the wife of a rich man, poor man, beggar man or thief.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ Head sleuth of the Ohio Gang in the days of President Harding, and one of the cleverest crooks that ever lived, Gaston Means, is dead. He was one of the old-style detectives that considered it perfectly proper to commit a crime in attaining whatever objective he had in view. It was he that helped Mrs. Harding to place in the president’s hands the love letters which the president wrote while in office to the laundry worker who, it is alleged, in that time became the mother of his daughter. In the days of the Lindbergh kidnaping excitement Means persuaded Mrs. McLean, of Washington, to give him $104,000 with which to pay off the kidnapers. Not a cent of that money was ever recovered, and for helping himself to it Means died in prison. The world is certainly better off with him out of it. How he escaped being head of the New York Stock Exchange or some other kindred enterprise is hard to understand.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ Last year the world produced new gold of the value of $1,284,500,000; and Uncle Sam bought gold of the value of $1,750,000,000, to put away in the Kentucky hole in the ground at Fort Knox. This clever work of buying every year more gold than is mined in the whole world is made possible by the fact that Uncle Sam shoved up the price from $20,83 an ounce to $35. Now, if some bright statesman would only think of offering, say, a dollar apiece for watermelons, Uncle Sam could just get billions of them. Wouldn’t that be something 3 Meantime, before the watermelon statesmen arise to the occasion, it may be remarked in passing that in 1935 Uncle Sam gladly paid 77¾c an ounce for silver when the world market price was 641c. Twelve silver-producing countries hurried up and sent to America all the silver they could spare at the premium offered.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ In the huge printing plant at Washington Uncle Sam has three rotary web printing presses that print, cut, deliver and band postal cards in packs of fifty, at the rate of 6,400 per rnimfte. The total annual output runs to nearly 2,000,000,000 cards, or in excess of 5,000,000 daily. The Government printing plant, by the way, keeps 5,500 employees busy on its 22 acres of floor space, Operating 406 typesetting machines to keep its presses full of work. It is far and away the largest printing plant in the world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ Take note! During the year 1938, about 5,600,000 American households received public aid. At four persons to the household, that represents a total of 22,400,000 individuals, or about one-fifth of the nation. The distribution of public funds to these millions affords opportunities for religious and political racketeers never before presented.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">British Comment</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By J. H emery {London}</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark195"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark196"></a>General Conditions &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">• War preparation activity has brought some advantages: there is much less unemployment and consequently a considerable increase in domestic business. The latest published figures of unemployment show a drop of nearly 500,000, reducing the number of unemployed to about one and a half million persons. It is said by experts that even in good business times it is to be expected that almost a million persons will be unable to obtain constant work and must at least temporarily seek assistance from the insurance funds. The call to military service is also affecting the general conditions, and that apart from the 200,000 young men who are being conscripted. There is a general sense of activity abroad, and talk of a trade boom is being encouraged by the newspapers. In the meantime the Government is spending the accumulated resources of the country at a great rate. The recent war scare and a realization that the two dictators who have shown that they will take every chance to achieve their set purpose—openly declared by Hitler ip his “bible”, and less openly by Mussolini— have silenced criticism of the Government’s spending. It is no exaggeration to say that the majority of the people do not give themselves much concern about the future, but are content to live from day to day, getting as much enjoyment out of their circumstances, poor or rich, as may be possible. Official report of the ordered registration of the 200,000 young men of 20-21 years shows that only about 3,000 registered a conscientious objection to military service. The Conscription Act gives no freedom to objectors; it has provision for tribunals to consider whether or not these may be freed from active military service or be put into other service under the control of the Government.</span></p></li></ul>
<h6><a name="bookmark197"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark198"></a>Diplomatic Duplicity</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">• The British Cabinet might be considered as having got a damaging exposure of its fear or attempted duplicity when Hitler gave a great welcome in Hamburg to his troops returned from their victories in Spain. When questioned in Parliament about the well-known fact of the presence of German soldiers fighting in Franco’s rebellion the Government pleaded either that they had no official knowledge of the troops or that the German Government denied their troops were in Spain. Probably the duplicity of the German Government was in telling their British inquirers that it might be that some Germans had gone to Spain as volunteers, and their willing “dupes” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">London accepted the statement as the way out; for Germany was a member of the non-intervention committee, and Britain wanted to avoid a quarrel with Hitler. There were 20,000 Germans in Franco’s army. However, the return was not camouflaged; the soldiers were received with the honors of a victorious army, and the British statesmen could think about the matter as they pleased. The game must have been as well known to the British politicians. It all serves as an illustration of the game of politics, much of it played with lies and deceit.</span></p></li></ul>
<h6><a name="bookmark199"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark200"></a>Ministry of Information</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">• As one of the war preparations the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Govern</span><span class="font5">ment has set up a Ministry of Information: to gather itfind to spread it in the form of propaganda. Naturally what is gathered will be sorted and sifted, and as much as is for use at home and abroad will be arranged to suit certain purposes. Goebbels is angry and loudly shouts out that this is another proof of an attempt to encircle Germany. The minister in . charge of the department is the earl of Perth, ‘ long known as Sir Eric Drummond, last used as British representative in Rome; was before that secretary of the League of Nations, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">is a Roman Catholic.</span></p></li></ul>
<h6><a name="bookmark201"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark202"></a>Stung Priests Are Angry</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">• The constant service which the witnesses of Jehovah render to ‘Him to the honor and the vindication of His holy name, and which of necessity exposes the Roman Catholic church system as false to the Scriptures and absolutely without divine authority, is stinging the Roman priests. For many years they have attempted to stop the witness in such ways as were open to them, as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> has shown. They had some success in the radio broadcasts by Judge Rutherford, because they were able to put pressure on some broadcasting stations, which through fear of the action of the priests ceased to give facilities for the broadcasting of truth to the people. They have had some success in some British colonies by persuading the local authorities that the truth carried by Jehovah’s witnesses unsettled the native populations. The challenge by Judge Rutherford for open public discussion they will not meet, preferring their usual Catholic Action methods of working secretly and through fear and intimidation. The message contained in the millions of booklets and of leaflets distributed in Britain, especially those following Judge Rutherford's exposure in the world broadcast speech in the Royal Albert Hall, London, when he showed that the Papacy and Fascism are in agreement, and that Catholic Action should be known as Fascist-Catholic Action, has stung the priests. They are angry. The Roman Catholic church has had many attacks made on it: on its false claims and false teachings, forged by perversions of the Scriptures and by making the writings and pronouncements of men as of equal authority with the Word of God. But it has never been exposed to the truth as it is now exposed; nor could it be so exposed till the day of Jehovah’s judgments should come. The Papacy sees in the witness to the truth that which God purposes it should see: it sees the warning of its destruction by Him whom they hypocritically profess to serve. If the Hierarchy were as sure of themselves and their place before God according to their claims they would not be perturbed. But they are angry, and they show their anger by stirring up their dupes to make malicious personal attacks on those who carry the truth to the people. Judge Rutherford is the subject of their malice in a special way, for the reason that in the good pleasure of God he is spokes-.man of Jehovah’s witnesses in bringing the truth to the people. With malice a Jesuit priest, who is given prominence in a London Catholic newspaper, says of the message of truth, “It seeks to pull everything downchurches, governments and social usages”; and of the witnesses he declares “they are all-but avowed apostles of revolution and anarchy to come”. This priest claims to have a long-time knowledge of the publications of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, and to be intimate with them. This being so, he knows that he lied when he wrote the above-quoted words. There is not a line to be found in them possible of interpretation as leading to agitation against governments, nor to anarchy or revolution. The publications of the Society,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">being expositions of the words of God and Christ the King, always urge obedience to the laws of the countries, except when by evil men laws are enacted which would prevent a disci pie and follower of Christ from fulfilling his obligation to God. On the other hand, the Hierarchy are now active in trying to get owners of halls to break their contracts where they learn that Jehovah’s witnesses purpose to hold meetings. In various places, as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> has stated, the priests have brought a mob, and at least indirectly, if not actually, the inciters have caused physical violence to Jehovah’s witnesses. Their angry outbursts are having the result of telling many of those who have been duped that there is a witness against the doctrines and the claims of the priests and their church, and many Catholics have become active workers with Jehovah’s witnesses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark203"></a>Canterbury’s Failures</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">• The call to religion made by the archbishop of Canterbury fell on dull ears. Though not officially buried, it is now a dead thing. His more recent endeavor to get some life into religion by a prayer league for peace which all outside the church of Rome might join seems going the same way. It was not expected that the Roman Catholics would join in, but it was hoped that &quot;his holiness” the pope might give his co-operation, by allowing himself to be considered the leader of the league. The Hier-. archy in Rome is not to be caught, neither by a' peace nor by a prayer movement, so as to admit that the many other churches shall be accounted as acceptable to its communion or co-operation. There is no advertising of any success resulting from the prayers ■which the sections of religionists have said. Franco had got his war over before they began their prayers, but Hitler has been all the time scheming for his next move. Probably the Japanese war on China was forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who are instructed in the Scriptures and who understand the things written know that such prayers as have been uttered by religious organisations are not according to the will of God. He docs not hear them. When Jesus taught His disciples to pray and what to pray for, saying, “After this manner pray ye,” the first petition is, “Thy kingdom come.” But that is the last thing religionists will pray for. They do not believe that Jesus comes while evil rules, in order to establish the kingdom of heaven. They have set themselves to believe that it is the business of the churches to bring about the kingdom of heaven on earth, and they will not pray in Jesus’ words as He meant to be understood, nor seek that God would again send His Son that the Kingdom should be established, and evil destroyed from the face of the earth. The peace of the earth has never been the responsibility of the church of Jesus Christ, not even in the matter of prayer. The kingdom of God, its righteousness, and the honor and vindication of His name, are the things to seek and pray for.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark204"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark205"></a>Some Preachers Uneasy</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">• The Protestant clergy have wrought havoc with the faith of their flocks. They have got them to believe that the writings of Moses and the prophets are not the word of God. Now some of the less reekless among the parsons are beginning to see that in this show of learning and of being wise in the eyes of men they have done damage to their own cause, the interests of religion. The dogma of the Trinity, which states that the Living God is not one God, but three Gods which yet make only one, is the foundation of “Christian religion” alike in Protestantism as in the Roman Catholic church. But all have to admit that it is not taught by Jesus and the apostles. The- Roman church states the dogma declares a fact, and that is the end of the matter for its members, Scripture proof or not; but Protestants, who have no such pronouncement, seek Bible support, and go to the writings they denounce. But those who perceive what has been done -will not raise their voices against the propaganda of unbelief: the interests of religion and of their own particular church system will prevent that. This absurd dogma, so contrary to the Scriptures, so derogatory to the iionor and glory of the Living God, has been accepted by ail the churches, and they are bound by it so tightly as will prevent them from getting free. It may be said to be the Devil’s masterpiece of deception. No one who tries to believe the Father and the Son are really one and the same can understand what God has revealed of himself, nor see what is revealed of Christ, and the provision God has made for those who come to Him through Christ. To have a mystery in their religion suits religionists: it is preferred to the knowledge </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">of the</span><span class="font5"> Word of God. The atmosphere of a mystery is the stronghold of religion, and in this it takes a place with that of the soothsayers and witchdoctors.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark206"></a>Catholics and Politics</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">• At the time of writing, the proposed pact between Britain and -Russia from which Britain expects so much for the preservation of peace is still undetermined. How much Russia desires the pact does not appear; Britain and France are the seekers. Naturally enough Russia will safeguard its interests and seek some advantage from the bargaining. It has already been suggested that the hierarchy in Rome is using its influence in London to prevent such agreement between Britain and Russia, What it is doing will not come to light, but that the proposal is particularly obnoxious to the Roman Hierarchy is apparent, as their newspapers disclose. Britain is one of the chief hopes of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and Russia is a detestation. Russia is an anti-God country, and has no use at all for the Roman Catholic church, but considers it as one of the chief obstacles to human progress, particularly the Soviet brand. Russia has already shown what it would &lt;^o to the Roman church system if it had the opportunity: it would sweep it away as it swept Czardom into destruction. For Britain to enter into a pact with that country would be a heavy blow to the Hierarchy, busied as it is in telling the world that its greatest danger is Communism as seen in Russia.- The popes, it is claimed, do not interfere in polities. The late pope, when denying a charge of political interference,. cried out, “It is a lie.” The “holy church” wishes that it should be known as a religious power. But when the British-Russian pact was mooted the present pope immediately got busy with the five greater nations of Europe, excluding Russia, to get them into a peace pact. Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Poland in peace, and the conditions in Europe would resume their normal life. The effort is suspect. It is the polities of the Hierarchy in active operation for the benefit of the Roman Catholic church. The main desire is not to seek peace in Europe; it cannot be said that the Papacy shows itself active in the cause of peace: it has quite recently shown that it will give support to war if the interests of the Roman church are to gain, as witness its share in the Italian war on Abyssinia and its aid to Franco in Spain. Britain is not yet under the bondage of the Roman Hierarchy, and undoubtedly the people of Britain prefer an arrangement w-hieh will keep the aggressive dictators in bounds, as a pact with Russia promises to do.</span></p>
