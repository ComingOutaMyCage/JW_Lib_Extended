<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>The Crime of Vaccination</span></h2>
<div><img src="g_E_19390531_files/g_E_19390531-2.png" alt="" style="width:42pt;height:42pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">AS THE clergy thrive by exploiting the spiritual perplexities of the people, and politicians prosper by their governmental difficulties, so the medical profession makes merchandise of the people by capitalizing on their physical ailments. While the ecclesiastics inoculate the people with spiritually poisonous doctrines, the medicos vaccinate them with deadly serums. How the Devil must laugh at the cruel hoax by which bodies are said to be made healthy through the injection of diseased tissues, and immunity to disease is obtained by corrupting the blood-stream!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If the Medical Association had been in existence in the days of Christ they wotild have insisted on vaccinating the babe Jesus, on the assumption that He was not in proper condition until they had injected a goodly number of 1,300-odd serums and vaccines of filthy pus. It would not have done Mary any good to protest, either. They would have laughed at her objections and dismay and would have put Joseph in jail (as they did John Marsh of Carlisle, Pennsylvania), reduced Mary to want, and finally vaccinated Jesus anyway, by force. They would have had no compunction whatever about doing this, even as they have no compunction about doing the same thing now to followers of Christ, the least of His brethren. Mary and Joseph were able to flee from Herod, but they would have been hard put to it to escape the watchful eye and far-reaching tentacles of the Medical Association. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The foregoing hypothetical illustration is set forth to emphasize the arrant wickedness of the entire vaccine and serum setup and those who sponsor it and profit by it. Their proposition reduces itself to the dictum that God’s creatures, even if pictures of health and beauty, are not fit for life until the Med-</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MAV 31, 1936 </span><span class="font7">ical Association has injected a score or more vaccines and serums; the more, the better. And though one may feel that such a practice is nothing short of ungodly, his conscientious scruples are ignored and violently overruled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Medical Association is not content with one Vaccination. There would be slight profit in that. Vaccinations of various kinds are recommended, and, where possible, insisted upon, in order to “guard” the individual against known and unknown diseases.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>What a Discovery!</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">What a discovery it was when the doctors found out that healthy persons needed their services (at a price)! The world was well on the way to an appreciation of the fact that cleanliness, moderation in food, fresh air, exercise and attention to other natural health rules were the best preventives against disease, when the doctors decided that even if people did look healthy enough to outlive Methuselah they were really in a bad way until they had had at least a few shots of serum and vaccine; and the more, the safer the individual would be. Where would the doctors and sebum-peddlers be today if it had not been for this “marvelous discovery”, and the further discovery that the law could be called in to make sure that nobody got away. You’ve got to be vaccinated, or else—!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By the way, that “or else—” business has become a little too prominent since the world was hnade safe for democracy’. You’ve got to be vaccinated, and your children especially, or else—! You’ve got to salute Hitler, or Mussolini, or the swastika or the flag, or else—! That tendency should be watched and opposed. It is the essence of totalitarianism and the denial of the most fundamental of human rights. It resolves itself into the question, “Will you do this or that because it is right</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">and proper, or will you do it because of fear of reprisal and punishment, whether it is right or not?” It is like the ultimatum of the racketeer, “You’ll take it and like it.” It is the spirit of Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You’ve got to be vaccinated, or else—I That “or else” may mean a lot. The children may be expelled from school, and have been. The parents may be arrested for failing to send the child to school, even though the child comes every day only to be refused admittance. The father may lose his job. The family may come to want and be obliged to apply for relief. Then the representatives of “law and order” step in and vaccinate the child in spite of the parents’ well-founded objections. The' John Marsh case is an example of the way in which doctors through “the law” set aside the inalienable right of an individual to say what shall be done with his own body, and the bodies of his children. Vaccination is in reality an assault upon the individual and a violation of his body. This by way of introduction to a symposium of views and reviews on the subject of ‘Vaccination and Serumization’, with some additional observations on vivisection, which may be viewed as closely related. As the practice of vivisection is medical and surgical experimentation upon . animals, so the injection of serums and vaccines is virtual experimentation upon human creatures. The following material has been gathered from various sources, whioh are indicated, and constitutes a telling array of facts in support of the contention that these practices are criminal in the extreme, human laws in their support to the contrary notwithstanding.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>How Smallpox Vaccine Virus Is Made</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">A calf is tied down to an operating table, the stomach is shaved from twelve to fifteen inches square, and about one hundred incisions are made. Into these incisions one drop of glycerinated lymph (a culture of smallpox ..passed through a solution of glycerine) is allowed to drop and is thoroughly rubbed in. Fever sets in and the animal becomes exceedingly sick. In a few days the vesicles appear, the scabs form, and the elimination of impurities of various kinds from the blood of the calf begins, in the form of pus, which is thrown out of the blood into the vesicles. At the end of six days the process of elimination has proceeded so far that the vesicles are full of pus, putrid cells, etc., and a scab has formed over the reservoir of disease. The calf is once more bound and laid upon the operating table. The inoculated area is washed with warm-water, and each vesicle is clasped with clamps, separately. The crust is carefully scraped with the edge of a steel instrument and the dead skin, lymph, poisonous pus and blood that are exuded are transferred to a small crucible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To this hoftible mass of putrid matter is added an equal measure of glycerine, and the mass then thoroughly stirred and mixed by a small electric motor. As soon as it is rendered homogeneous it is placed in another crucible •. and passed through a very fine sieve, in order to remove the coarse pieces of rotten flesh, hair, etc.; then the mixture is again beaten up, thoroughly mixed, transferred to tubes and distributed throughout the country as pure calf lymph, when in reality there is no such thing as pure lymph. It is this rotten stuff that our health boards, school boards and family physicians insist upon having introduced directly into the circulation of the blood of millions of school children every year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But this is not the worst. Dr. S.. Monckton Copeman, at the Victoria University of Manchester, April 25, 1904, said: '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The most satisfactory material was found to be vesicle pulp, obtained in the post-mortem room from cases of discrete smallpox that had died during a comparatively early stage of the eruption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dr. Copeman goes on to tell how, after this “pulp” had been mixed with glycerine, it was inoculated into monkeys, next into calves, and then into children. Vaccine lymph made from vesicle pulp taken from sores in the body of a living patient is revoltingly unsanitary, and, -we hold, clearly an illegal product. But what shall be said if made from the putrid sores on a smallpox corpse ? — California Animal Defense and Anti-Vivisection League, Inc., Los Angeles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ella Maillart, writing in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">John o’ London’s Weekly,</span><span class="font7"> states that Weigl anti-typhus vaccine is produced in the following way: A guineapig is injected with some blood from a person suffering from typhus, but in order to produce a vaccine efficacious for humans, the disease has to be transmitted to lice. The Peking laboratory has a nursery of these insects, the only one in the world. Chinese who have recovered from typhus and are immune come twice a day to act as grazing grounds for the lice. For half an hour the insects suck the blood, which is a necessity to them. On each leg a man nourishes a hundred, distributed in little boxes which have netting on one sjde. Idle men who nurse the lice are often ragged beggars surprised to find themselves paid for nursing parasites which they used to carry on themselves all day and night for nothing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Poisoning, stupefying and robbing mankind</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">The old method of ripening pus for injection into the human blood-stream was to squirt it into a calf, and when the calf got sick enough, and the pus was ratten enough, it was collected and the “pure” rot of uncertain origin was put forth to produce infantile paralysis, blindness or whatever other disease besides cowpox it may have at first contained or later collected. All this is now improved' by a Japanese method. The Japanese take the same filthy stuff, mix it with “meat juice”, certain tissues from rotten hens’ eggs and other choice bits, and it is ready to b% shot into humans without going through the calf. Surely “the world do move”. To make sure the stuff is all O.K. and will be suitable for pumping into W esterners, they tried it out on 2,500 patients in one of their hospitals. It now remains to be seen if American pus-growers can rise to the occasion and duplicate the stunt here. Otherwise the pus trade will go to the Japanese.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Methods of Increasing Vaccine Sales</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">Dr. John P. Koehler, health commissioner, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, frankly describes the startling method of increasing the sales of any vaccine they decide to force upon the public, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This we attempted to do in three ways—first, by education; second', by fright; and third, by pressure. During the months of March and April we tried education and vaccinated only 62,000. During May we made use of fright and pressure and vaccinated 223,000 people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not content with this, as there were still many people who would not be educated or frightened, officials compelled all employers to force their employees to be vaccinated or lose their positions.......California Animal De</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Compulsory Vaccination</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">I cannot understand why there should be any attempt to compel anyone to be vaccinated against his will. We who are vaccinated have nothing to fear from anyone who is not vaccinated, unless we are sadly mistaken about the value of vaccination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Tt has been my observation that health department officials who are most active in this persecution of people who do not wish to be vaccinated are generally of questionable character and honesty. By making a great show of zeal in the protection of the public health in that contemptible way the grafters and crooks holding health board jobs and collecting illicit money on the side manage to escape dose scrutiny of their official conduct by the public. — Dr. William Brady, in Milwaukee </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Sentinel.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Compulsory Blood-Poisoning</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">If someone should ask you if you believed in and were an advocate of blood-poisoning you no doubt would answer emphatically in the negative. If someone should ask you if you believed in and were an advocate of vaccination, perhaps you would answer in the affirmative; and yet the practice of vaccination is nothing more nor less than deliberate blood-poisoning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If you have never doubted the supposed virtue of this practice you may be inclined to take issue with the foregoing statement. If this is true, then what is to follow will be all the more interesting to you. The practice </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">vaccination consists in the introduction into the system of a substance called “vaccine virus”. Have you ever stopped to consider what this virus is, and how it is obtained? In reality it is the slimy, poisonous oozings of ulcers from a diseased calf.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MAY 31, 1939</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">The word “virus” is of Latin origin, meaning “a slimy liquid; poisonous liquid; poison; stench”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New Universal Dictionary</span><span class="font7"> defines “virus” as “organic, contagious or poisonous matter by which disease is introduced into the system”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">According to the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Century Dictionary,</span><span class="font7"> it means “a morbid poison; slime or poison”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Webster’s </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">International Dictionary</span><span class="font7"> says it is “contagious or poisonous matter as of specific ulcers, the bite of snakes, etc., applied to organic poisons”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">According to Gould’s </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Medical Dictionary, </span><span class="font7">“virus” means “a poison that causes a morbid process or disease”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All dictionaries, it will be seen, are agreed that virus is a poison; and when we consider how the substance is produced, when we call to mind that it is nothing more nor less than the morbid filth that nature wisely eliminates from the body of a diseased calf, we can readily appreciate the correctness of these definitions. The calf’s blood is poisoned by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">seed </span><span class="font7">virus, and the reaction that results is but the natural operation of the law of self-preservation that applies to all living creatures. The purpose of the reaction is to eliminate the impurities that have been introduced into the blood, thus to preserve the life of the beast. The filthy slime thus eliminated from the calf is collected and put through a series of processes and then used to vaccinate human creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The reaction in the human body that results when vaccine is introduced into the system is similar to the reaction that takes place in the calf when so-called “seed” virus is in-, jected into it. The object and purpose of the reaction in both cases is to purify the blood and preserve the life of beast or child as the case may. be. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Instinct and reason should prompt every person to keep the blood-stream pure. Sanitary drinking cups, individual towels, etc., are the outgrowth of the desire to avoid contamination and promote the purity of the blood. Health is absolutely impossible unless the blood approximates a certain degree of purity. Then what scientific foundation can there be for justifying the practice of vaccination?.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Science as well as Scripture teaches that ‘as ye sow, so shall ye also reap’; in other words, that the harvest must conform to the seed sown; that we cannot “gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles”; that ‘a corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit’. Vaccination is a “corrupt tree” and must bring forth fruit after its own kind. By the practice of vaccination the seeds of disease are implanted in the body, and health is always placed in jeopardy. Even life itself is Often sacrificed' because of this blood-contaminating operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This practice is justified and forced upon the public because of the false belief that health is thereby safeguarded, or, more specifically, that it prevents smallpox—<sub>1</sub>a disease that has largely been eliminated by improvements in sanitation and personal hygiene. This false' conclusion is zealously fostered by a powerful commercial-medical-political combination that is almost impossible to overcome. It is subsidized in practically every, nation .on earth and deeply entrenched in national, state and city governments. This state of affairs has been brought about by recourse to ’ mob psychology and careful cultivation of the fear complex.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But as sure as truth liberates, the time is coming when this destructive practice oi compulsory blood-poisoning will cease, and people will no longer be deprived of their inalienable right to maintain the purity of their bloodstream. It will become obvious to every sane-minded individual, even physicians, that health cannot be promoted by polluting the blood, but, on the contrary, only evil can result from such a filthy practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When it is so apparent that the practice of vaccination is founded on falsehood and error, the question logically arises, Why do doctors continue to believe in and advocate it? There may be several reasons for this, but the principal one, no doubt, is that they have been taught that vaccination has rid the world of smallpox. This belief is promulgated as one of the verities of science, and statistics are advanced to substantiate it. The result is that seldom will a doctor of the orthodox school bother to give the matter so much as an inquiring thought. Then, too, the political and commercial aspects of vaccination are * a strong factor in its perpetuation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But let the true nature of vaccination be known, and the practice will rapidly die out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Doctors themselves will gradually become disillusioned, just as they did in regard to the practice of bloodletting and many other pernicious remedies that have long since been discarded. Let it be known that compulsory vaccination is the inoculation of the body with a &quot;morbid poison”-, and gradually there will be a revision of sentiment in, as well as out of, the medical profession toward this evil practice, which eventually will result in the repeal of all laws making it compulsory. Many years ago wo w'ere assured by the greatest of all teachers, “Ye shall know' the truth, and the truth shall make you free.&quot;—George W. Reid, M.D., D.O., Massachusetts.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Are the Serums Harmless?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">One of the greatest lies is the statement, “Inoculations and injections are harmless.” Be convinced now, last and always, that it is a lie, and I will prove it to you here and now—not by my say-so, but I will let you read what one of the leading manufacturers of this filth has to say about “serum sickness”. You have all either read or heard of this condition at times, in the medical propaganda you have read, or from persons w'ho have suffered because of having had serum vaccines and toxins injected into them, but it was never explained to you just what serum sickness is, and its results. Of course, medicine will not inform you of the bad results of anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This is a doctor-made disease, as vaccinia is, which results after vaccination from smallpox. I will give you parts of that lengthy article, which was printed in “Roche Review”, a monthly booklet published by Hoffman-La Roche, Ine., Nutley, N. J., a manufacturer of medical preparations, serums, vaccines and toxins for injections. This story was published in their July issue, 1937, Vol. I, No. 10, on page 281. The following explains itself, leaving nothing for me to say, and plenty for you to think about. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. . . The clinical picture of serum sickness is distinctive and, with the history of serum administration, presents no diagnostic difficulty. There are two types of delayed reaction -whose symptoms are essentially similar, the only difference being in intensity. One type occurs after the patient’s first experience with antiserum, and the other occurs in cases in which previous injection has sensitized the patient. In the latter type the incubation period is shorter and the symptoms more severe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The most constant findings are Urticaria, Adenopathy, Arthralgia, Fever, and Edema. In addi-</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MAY 31, 1939</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">tion Abdominal Pain, Vomiting, Diarrhea, Headache and sore throat may be present. In extreme cases, shock (collapse) and even death may occur. , . ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Serum sickness rarely occurs without skin, lesions. Usually urticarial in form, or a mixture of urticaria and erythema, the eruption is always attended by pruritus, which may be severe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. . . Joint manifestations occur in about half of the patients. They play be entirely subjective, with no outward evidence; or a true arthritis may develop, with swelling, heat exudate and redness. The knees, ankles, elbows and wrists are most commonly affected. In about 30 percent of the cases, fever ranging from 99 to 104 occurs. It is usually remittent and may last for a week or more. Edema also occurs in about one-third of patients, occasionally accompanied by signs of impaired renal (kidney) function. The face, sacrum, pretibial re- . gions, ankles and upper extremities are most commonly affected. The evidence of transient kidney damage are chloride and water retention, a reduced phenolsulphonthalein excretion, albumin and cylindrical casts. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. . . Treatment is symptomatic. [There is no cure or specific for all these conditions. You have to battle your way out yourself. If you don’t, it is just too bad.—</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Author]</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. . , Immediate serum reactions, the so-called “serum accidents” [great injury and death], occur immediately following the administration Of serum, sometimes even before the needle is withdrawn. In such instances the cause of the reaction lies in the specific sensitivity of the individual to the type of serum administered, a sensitivity which may be inherent and not necessarily induced by previous serum administration. [Blame it on the patient.—</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Author]</span><span class="font7"> As has already been noted, severe, even fatal, reactions may occur in persons who have received previous injections of serum. These are called ‘secondary serum accidents’. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And still, my good friends, you continue to read and believe that inoculations are harmless, because the M.D., who listens to the manufacturers, tells you so. The newspapers and magazines give millions of dollars of free advertising to these firms and doctors yearly. Such news sheets are causing thousands of deaths yearly because of this—unknowingly perhaps, for business reasons principally in many cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The above is a story written by the manufacturer who makes such filthy products. I believe that should be convincing enough. But you are not allovred to read this side of the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Still knowing all this, the manufacturer is allowed to make it, and the medicine man continues to inject this material into healthy blood-streams, making up their own statistics</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">and results, to satisfy the public mind that it is all for “public welfare”. With all their test tubes, white gowns, knives, etc., medicine becomes very intriguing to the public mind, and makes wonderful “copy” for the newspapers and magazines. But have they ever stopped to think of the results, or checked their statements? The crippling, blinding and death caused by such practice is appalling. If they would print in the newspapers what they print in their personal journals about the results of their practices, medicine would collapse overnight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A few results printed: At Los Angeles a youth of 20 years was caught in the act of choking a woman of 75. Arrested, and suspected of three murders, he claims that the urge to kill came as a result of serum inoculations given him in a CCC camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If you want to turn to stone, and you have heard of a number of these cases lately, you might try receiving anti-typhoid injections. It worked that way with Mrs. Iola Swinnerton, of Chicago, who has been in a hospital ten years because she let her blood-stream be thus polluted. She is now but 33 years of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Has anyone ever heal'd of a pure mountain stream of water being made more pure by running a sewer into it? Would medical science (?) have us believe that our secretions, serums, organs and reactions match those of the lowest animals? Is there one disease that medicine can prove they have prevented with vaccines? To prove prevention, you first have to prove that person would get that disease in the first place; and who in the world is going to prove THAT?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Oh, yes, serums, vaccines, toxins, inoculations, are all “harmless”, because the man who is selling them says so. You, my friends, believe this lie, and continue to submit your body to these violations; then all I can say is, “God have mercy on your soul.”—James I. Bardsley, D.C., Ph.C., N.D., Ph.N., Pennsylvania.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>Tribute to Vaccination</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">It may be that you do not know what vaccination and inoculation are—it may be that you do not know that these practices consist of putting the putrid discharge from the running sores of diseased persons and animals and other diseased human and animal substances into the blood-stream of healthy persons, contaminating it so that, in the ease of persons susceptible to particular diseases, one disease or another may result either immediately or at some time in the future. And to make these putrid substances, great cruelty </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font7">practiced upon animals by diseasing them, causing them untold pain and suffering and eventually killing them uselessly with disease. These practices sow the seed of infantile paralysis, tetanus, syphilis, cancer, consumption, and other loathsome diseases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The vaccine makers contend that their product isn’t so harmful because it comes from a calf after originally coming from a human [creature], believing apparently that calf pus is not so bad as human pus after the human pus has been smeared into the calf and has festered on the calf into calf pus. But there are reasons why calf pus is a worse substance to introduce into the human circulation than human pus (or human cellular substance); for observe: The calf cells multiply fifteen or twenty times as rapidly as human cells. These calf cells introduced into the human circulation are not digested as they would be if taken into the stomach—they remain living cells indefinitely. Killing the calf does not at once kill the cells of the animal, as many biologists will testify. Thus getting into the circulation, the foreign cells are carried through lymph ducts to glands and there deposited. Should they retain life and subsequently multiply, as they undoubtedly do in many cases, they multiply according to their nature, rapidly, causing bunches—tumors, cancer and other morbid growths have had their most rapid increase since bovine vaccines have become the rule. All vaccination is unphysiologieal — </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">crime against nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Out of what hell of research could the idea of such grafting have sprung but from that lowest region where misnamed doctors combine disease cultivation with animal torture and carry it on as their life work?—H. Eugene Gardner, prominent Philadelphia attorney.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Picric acid and zinc sulphate have been introduced to aid in cases of infantile paralysis. According to the dictionary, picric acid is used jn dyeing and in explosives and zine sulphate (white vitriol) is made by combining sulphuric acid and zinc. A prophylactic is something that is supposed to prevent disease. All right. What do you say to trying out a combination of these two chemicals, one so useful in dyeing and explosives, and the other so effective as an emetic and astringent ? Maybe the two of them together might prevent the spreading plague of infantile paralysis (which some able physicians believe directly traceable to vaccination). With this little introduction, one is able to understand the following conclusions of Dr. Mervin C. Myerson, director of the nose and throat department of Kings County Hospital, Brooklyn, N. Y., based on a long study at that institution, recently made public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The effectiveness of astringent chemicals when used in preventing infantile paralysis in monkeys was so great . . . that the prophylactic method was tried out on mass populations, first in the South and last year in Toronto. In both instances no conclusions of any kind were drawn because of the uncertainty of the results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Just a mild suggestion from one who does not know it all, but loves his fellow men: How about cutting out both the vaccination and the picric acid and zinc sulphate and all similar experiments for a while, and teach hygiene, and sec what effect that has on the infantile paralysis curse.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Not One Penny for One Crutch</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">At a recent hearing for a bill before a subcommittee of the House District Committee, Dr. Joseph Wall, professor of children’s diseases at Georgetown University, and acting chief of staff at Children’s Hospital, Washington, D. C., said: “The chief purpose of the Birthday Balls is to raise an enormous fund for research. Not one penny of that fund will go to buying a crutch for a crippled child. Not one dollar will go to President Roosevelt’s pet foundation in Georgia. The majority of the dollars will go for the purchase of monkeys in order that we may carry out proper animal research.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In recent years, many thousands of monkeys have been tortured to “discover” a scrum to “prevent” infantile paralysis, and countless other animals have been diseased and “bled white” to make various serums, which were given to about 20,000 children, injuring their health and actually killing some, till United States health officials called a halt. Surely those who contributed to the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis do not wish their money, given to infantile paralysis sufferers, to be sunk in still more tortures, more injured and dead children ? Then write at once to the Trustees, 120 Broadway, New York City, and tell them so!—Alice K. Millard, New York.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Results of Vaccination</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">Reynold W. 'Wilcox, M.D., in his book on “The Treatment of Disease, a Manual of Practical Medicine”, states, at page 244:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MAY 31, 1939</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Complications of Vaccination: Cellulitis may occur, especially in debilitated children, as a result of contamination. Erysipelas is a serious complication and in certain instances dormant disease such as tuberculosis and syphilis may manifest itself. Vaccinia may prove fatal to children, for various bacteria and amoeboid bodies have been found in the vaccine lymph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A specific illustration of the possibility of introducing injurious bacteria by means of vaccination is that of the daughter of Prof. Michael Kinnealy of Dublin, who died of galloping consumption after being inoculated with a serum intended to prevent diphtheria (which the child might never have contracted in any event). The professor sued the serum manufacturers, Burroughs Wellcome, for £16,100 ($80,000) damages. Twenty-five other children similarly inoculated likewise contracted consumption or tubercular disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“ . . . Eczema and impetigo [skin disease with pustules] in particular have, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">post hoc, </span><span class="font7">been attributed to vaccination, but no direct connection has been proved to exist between the operation and the occurrence of these disorders. Of a different order is the post-vaccinal encephalitis described by Turnbull and McIntosh of the British Medical Association meeting in July 11)28. The condition has been noticed in some hundreds of cases and' manifests itself, on the average, ten to fourteen days after vaccination, as headache, delirium, paresis, and ultimately coma and death in fatal cases.”—Copied from the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopccdia Britannica,</span><span class="font7"> 14th Edition (1929), Vol. 22, page 922, 2nd column, under the subject of “Vaccination”, subheaded “Alleged Injurious Effects”, by The American Medical Liberty League, Inc., 404 South Wabash Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Achievements of vaccination are hardly of the kind to be extolled. In the year 1935, in the whole of England and Wales there were no deaths from smallpox; but do not think from this that nothing was accomplished by vaccination. There was. In that year eight deaths were registered as having been caused by vaccination. Superstition dies hard. Mexico, with the most rigid vaccination and revaccination law, has the highest smallpox death rate in the world. There is good reason to believe that smallpox is spread only by the bite of bedbugs that had previously had a smallpox dinner.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>How They Bolster Up False Statistics</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">Dr. Carr, former editor of the Columbus </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Medical Journal,</span><span class="font7"> said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We had in this city (Columbus, Ohio) an alleged epidemic of smallpox. A great many people were quarantined, and a great many were vaccinated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I took the pains to obtain this list of people, who were put down as never vaccinated. I obtained the list from the books at the Board of Health, and started out to visit the list. I visited 'the first thirty, and without exception they had been vae-cinated, some of them three or four times. I went back to the office, demanding an explanation of their false statistics, and the reply I got was as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“It doesn’t make any difference how many vaccination scars a man may be carrying, he has not been properly vaccinated if he gets the smallpox. The only proof we need that he has not been properly vaccinated is the fact that he catches smallpox, And if he had not been properly vaccinated, it is equivalent to never vaccinated.” Therefore, they eimply find out who has the smallpox, and then put them down as never vaccinated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another method of reducing smallpox statistics is to list smallpox eases in previously vaccinated children as chicken pox.— California Animal Defense and Anti-Vivisection League, Ine., Los Angeles.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>How Diphtheria Antitoxin Is Made</span></h5>
<div><img src="g_E_19390531_files/g_E_19390531-4.png" alt="" style="width:43pt;height:44pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">The method of manufacture of diphtheria anti - toxin furnishes a classical example of the manufacture of all serums used in the modern cult of serum therapy, whether of anti-plague serum, anti-tetanus serum, Sela-vo’s anthrax serum, anti-snake venom serum, anti-pneumoeoeeie serum, anti-meningitis serum, etc., etc. In most of the preparations a horse is used as the medium for obtaining the serum, but for the preparation of anthrax serum Sclavo uses a donkey and for that of anti-plague serum Haffkine usually uses a goat. A portion of the membranous excretion which appears upon the throat of a patient suffering from diphtheria is first extracted therefrom. It is necessary that it should contain the diphtheria bacillus; for many diphtheritic throats contain no diphtheria bacillus at all. This excretion is then transferred to a special beef broth, which is kept at a certain even temperature in an incubator for ten to fourteen days, until the germs multiply millionsfold, and the broth becomes alive with them. It is recommended that the meat which is used for making the broth should be kept for some days until incipient putrefaction has taken place. The broth is then filtered, and the filtrate is employed for injecting into horses. At first only a few drops are injected under the skin. The injections are administered twice a week in gradually increasing doses for a period of five or six months until the dose ultimately reaches as much as a pint to a pint and a half.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At first injections give rise to a considerable constitutional disturbance—as might be expected in such a blood-poisoning process. The animal’s temperature rises, it goes off its food, it may have diarrhea and shivering fits, etc., but the injections are continued until the animal—if it does not succumb—ceases to react. It is then said to be “immune”,, and its blood is supposed to contain an anti-toxin capable of neutralizing the toxin (i.e., poison) of diphtheria. The bleeding process then begins, usually on the third day after the last injection of the poisoned beef broth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The animal’s head is firmly secured; if at all refractory a cruel instrument called a, twitch is fixed on the upper lip, and a long sharp-pointed tube is driven into the horse’s neck over a large blood vessel, and two or three gallons of blood are drawn off into a receptacle. This process is repeated from time to time until the animal is exhausted, or is sold or dies. The blood coagulates and the clear fluid which rises to the surface-called serum—is then put into tubes and sold at fancy prices under the name of diphtheria anti-toxin.—Washington Humane Education and Anti-Vivisection Society, Spokane, Wash.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The cheerful work of pumping experimental serums goes bn in Canada, as in other semicivilized areas of the world, including the United States. The Calgary </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font7"> tells of one of the so-called “anti-diphtheria” serums’ being pumped into Basil Forester, nine-year-old son of a widow, at Olds, Alberta, and after a few days of intense suffering he died. Of thirty healthy children inoculated with the pus, twelve had to have their arms lanced and a dozen more were ill. It will now be up to the serum manufacturers to get out one more new serum and to get the news published far and wide of their “great discovery”, so that a market can be maintained for the filth they have to sell.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ A very bad case of assault and battery on Jehovah’s witnesses, the most serious that has yet been reported in Britain, occurred recently in the Clydebank district of Glasgow. A party of about sixty publishers started to work on the new housing scheme opposite John Brown’s shipbuilding yard, and Harold Youngman proceeded ahead of them to give lectures from the sound car. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font7"> was giving latter parts of ‘Safety’,” he reports. “It was a very strong Roman Catholic district, and I remember being told by a young fellow last year that I had better not come back here with ‘that stuff’. As there were a lot of kiddies around the car, I asked Malcolm Scott to stand by while the records were being run and keep the youngsters off. Malcolm says he casually noticed four fellows coming down the street behind the car. He paid no particular attention to them. Suddenly he received a blow on the face, then another follow, gave him a blow on the back of the head, while a third hit him in the back. The one who struck him first then walked to the car, opened the door, lifted his foot and brought his heel down on the transcription machine, breaking the record; then closing the door and jumping on the back of the car he threw the box speaker from the roof onto the ground. By this time some of the householders had come out and told the fellow that this sort of thing was not playing the game. Had it not been for the number who came from their houses, one of the roughs would have put a piece of wood through the windows of the ear.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The matter was reported to the police, resulting in a comb-out of the district, and subsequently four fellows were arrested, but only one of them could be identified #s participating in the attack. His name is McGrory— ’nough said—and he is to be tried at court shortly. Owing mainly to the fact that the one so violently attacked by these gangsters was rendered practically unconscious, it is doubtful whether all four will gpt their just . deserts; but to ensure successful identification in the future it would be well for publishers to note features, peculiarities of walk, or other distinguishing characteristics, so as not to let such assaults pass without punishment. —C.

<p><span class="font7">pioneer F. Headley for the past twenty years has been visiting the local populace at their homes and places of business and has called upon nearly 100,000 residents in the last eight years, while during the last four years over 8,000 people have gladly listened to, and given thanks for, the Kingdom message from the plronograph. Such a record speaks for itself concerning the peaceful, inoffensive manner and good work of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In pursuance of his God-given commission to preach the gospel of the Kingdom, pioneer Headley called at the home of Mr. Campbell, a Catholic, of Groby Road, Leicester, on Sunday, January 22, and when asked to listen to the message from the phonograph the man’s wife gave consent. The machine was started, and then Mr. Campbell came to the door and after listening for about a minute he suddenly became violent. To use Headley’s own words, He told me to get out or he would smash the machine. He was so violent that I had not time to close up the phonograph, and while I was protecting it he handled me so roughly that I could</span></p>

His wife then took action and kicked my case of literature (containing about 60 pieces) from the doorstep, and when I protested they both took all the matter out of the ease and strewed and kicked it about the garden. My leather ease was taken and deliberately ripped, and they refused to let me pick anything up. They finally threw everything over the garden fence. Many booklets were, of Course, damaged, and my nerves were so affected that I could not continue the work and have been unable to sleep.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Linemen Listening In</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Five witnesses of the Pittsburgh (Pa.) company chanced to come across a group of linemen at the lunch hour. The witnesses could talk to them in German, Croatian, Hungarian, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Ukrainian and English, hut they had something better. They had Judge Rutherford’s lectures in English, which all understood, and played several of them on the phonograph. Result: 6 bound books, 31 booklets, 27 phonograph attendance. Part of the group of listeners are shown in the picture.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ Fat men are proverbially good-natured; and when one of the best-natured of all of them was arrested and tried to express his anger, it was fun to hear from him, and to -notice that when he did try to get angry his wrath seemed to be specially vented toward one of his own type. He said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Was picked up today with another witness and we were taken to the police station where the radio desk sergeant tried to scare us out of seven years’ growth. We were not mu eh impressed. He raged, he stormed, he threatened, and when he had heard as much of the testimony as we could work in between noises, he howled, hut to no avail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The chief of police told us we could go, but if they had any more complaints they would have ■to arrest us and lock us up. It turned out that they knew all about our work and were only trying to bluff us. However, it was remarkable how civil the chief of police became after he had listened to Judge Rutherford on the “Enemies” record. And it sounded so much better because the obese* desk sergeant stormed and raged so his own ears would not hear it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As we went out the chief of police asked how long we were going to work. I said “a full hour”, and we did without further trouble. The fat* goat only had one complaint. The other officers were much amused at the fat* one’s agony. The reason, of course, that Fatso was so apoplectic was because we refused to ask for a permit, and told him the same ;rs Jeremiah told the Jews.—Jeremiah 26:8-15.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ Beneath contempt is the United Press dispatch from Alexandria, La., stating that the, assistant district attorney “investigated five men  arrested for the distribution of 'Fascist’ circulars”. The accused men were Jehovah’s witnesses. The literature described as “ ‘Fascist’ circular’s” is the most outspoken condemnation Of Fascism ever circulated; for it goes straight to the heart of the whole matter. But see the light in which the United Press puts it. The men were arrested, so the account goes on to say, for an “attack on the Catholic Church”. The average dumb reader is thus led to believe that the Catholic Church, which is the heart and soul of all Fascism, is against all Fascism, while Jehovah’s witnesses, the only real patriots in the country who have the guts to tell who is back of Fascism, are accused of being “Fascist”. If you can beat that for general all-round cussedness you will have to go some.</span></p>

It was a hot, dusty afternoon, with a fair amount of traffic. Every car that came along stopped and offered assistance. The traffic cop came by and offered his services. At last came the ice-cream man. He stopped, offered to help us, then said: “What is this message of the Kingdom?

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The downfall of Czechoslovakia was due primarily to French double-crossing and deliberate British betrayal. The Russians were ready to stand by their agreement to support Czechoslovakia, provided the French would do the same. And right up to September 18 the French government assured Benes that it would do so. Only British treachery encouraged Hitler to demand annexation of the Sudeten area:</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7">“This conclusion inevitably was known to Hitler before he committed himself to annexation, clearly with the full knowledge that Great Britain would not go to war, that therefore France would not meet her obligations, and that in turn Russia was not obligated to move, since her treaty with Czechoslovakia was contingent upon French support.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“One must join Professor Frederick L.

<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark89"></a>Religion Rejects Jehovah</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">HE VARIOUS universities maintain a ‘‘divinity school”, the purpose of which is to give instruction in matters religious. Recently the dean of Yale Divinity School issued a statement that the name Jehovah is to be  removed from the Standard Bible used by the religious organizations and added these words in his statement: “Jehovah is not a functioning religious term.” Religionists therefore openly and formally reject the name of Jehovah. During the past few years there has been such a wide publicity of the name of Jehovah by faithful Christians that the worldly authorities of religion see the necessity of turning the minds of religious people entirely away from Jehovah God in order that they might hold the parishioners in the organization. Manifestly the reason is fear that some sincere persons might learn the meaning of the name Jehovah, and completely abandon religion. It is true that religious practitioners have no desire to use the name of Jehovah, for the reason that religion is Satan’s chief instrument employed to fight against the Almighty Cod, whose name alone is Jehovah. In fact, the name Jehovah has never been a “functioning religious term”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The name Jehovah is of greatest importance to all lovers of righteousness, that is, the name of the Almighty God, winch name signifies His purpose toward His people, and particularly those who are in a covenant for ' His kingdom. When the Almighty God sent Moses to Egypt to act as the visible leader of the Israelites, and there to appear as the representative and servant of God, He revealed himself to Moses by the name Jehovah. Prior to that time no man had ever heard of the name Jehovah; “And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and, unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty; but by my name JEHOVAH was I&quot; not known to them. . . . Wherefore say unto the childrea of Israel, I am the Lord [Jehovah].”.—Exodus 6:3-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then the Lord God revealed to Moses that the meaning of the name Jehovah is His pur</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MAY 31, 1939 </span><span class="font7">pose concerning the people. The Israelites were God’s chosen people, used by Him to make prophetic pictures concerning His purpose to select “a people for his name”, which people should be used to declare His name and kingdom at the time of the coming of the Messiah. The Israelites, also called Jews, fell away to religion, and thereafter the name Jehovah was displeasing to them, and hence they substituted another name. The nation of Israel was a typical nation and specifically pictured or foreshadowed the present-day “Christendom”. Years ago professed Christians adopted what they called “the Christian religion” and then called themselves Christians; and all the nations where such a religion is practiced were called and are called “Christendom”. In recent years “Christendom” has completely abandoned Jehovah God and turned entirely to religion, and to such the name of Jehovah is undesirable, and now the big religious leaders reject the name of Jehovah and have substituted something else. Therefore the nations composing “Christendom” have forsaken the Almighty Jehovah God and have desired to forget His name. The fate of such is set forth in the prophecy written, to wit: “The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.”—Psalm 9:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is aptly stated by Professor Weigle, of Yale: “Jehovah is not a functioning religious term.” The reason that Mis name is not a “functioning religious term” is, because Jehovah is against religion and has expressed His purpose to destroy all religion, that the people of good will may know, believe and obey Jehovah God and live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s purpose, as His name implies, is to set up a government with Christ Jesus as ruler, invisible to human eyes, ’and who shall rule the world in righteousness. Such theocratic government will completely wipe out wickedness and will grant life everlasting in peace and happiness to all who take the side of Jehovah and obey Him and IIis King. The day of final reckoning is just at hand when the rule by Satan and all of his religious agents shall for ever cease, and which shall be followed thereafter by the righteous rule of Christ Jesus. At the battle of the great day of God Almighty, called “Armageddon”, the final end of religion will come, and that time, according to the words of Christ Jesus, “shall be great tribulation, such as was not [known] since the beginning of the world.” (Matthew 24:21) Why should Almighty God bring upon “Christendom” such a time of tribulation ? The prophet of Jehovah answers: “That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the Most High over all the earth” (Psalm 83:18) The rejection of the name Jehovah by the religionists is further evidence of the fulfillment of prophecy showing that we are now in the last days, when Satan is hurrying all nations to Armageddon. Only those who seek Jehovah and Christ Jesus, and obey God’s righteous law, shall escape and find the place of safety. '</span></p>

He could have made the journey by rail for $56.54, but would have missed experiences which he considered more valuable than a college education.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Netherlands </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reductio ad Absurdum</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">OVER in Europe there is, as you know, an arm of the sea running into the country of Holland; it is called the Zuyder Zee. It is very <sup>u</sup>&quot; ’ shallow', and for a very long time the Dutch have looked on it as a possible field for reclamation, Very wonderful reclamation projects have been undertaken in Holland century after century, and the Dutch thought to crown them by reclaiming the Zuyder Zee itself. A few years ago this great project actually got started. The Dutch, a highly capable people, with first-rate engineers, set themselves to this huge task. They undertook it with great skill and perseverance. And their efforts soon began to be crowned with success. In a surprisingly short time a considerable area of the sea had been reclaimed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now the Dutch agricultural experts had always said that as soon as the Zuyder Zee was reclaimed, and the land made available for cultivation, it would prove most fertile land for growing wheat. Again the calculations of the Dutch technicians proved perfectly correct. The land, as hoped, proved wonderful land for growing wheat. The Dutch farmers moved onto it and soon grew an admirable crop of wheat. Everything went exactly as the technicians had promised; it seemed that the whole enterprise was a triumphant success. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Well, it wasn’t long before the Dutch government had to step in to save its farmers. It had to buy up the wheat in order to keep it off the market. Then the Dutch government was itself faced with the problem of what to do with the wheat. After long and difficult negotiations the Dutch government managed to get into touch with the Danish government. And they were able to dispose of their wheat, though at ruinously low prices, to the Danish government. Now the purpose of the Danish government in buying the wheat was to use it, not for human consumption, but for feeding to the hogs, which are the chief products of Danish agriculture. Now, as you can imagine, this big influx of foodstuffs for the Danish hog-raising industry soon increased the supply of Danish pork and bacon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">, Up to this point everything had gone just as the Danish government had hoped. But now' the second difficulty arose. What was to be done with this Danish pork and bacon?</span></p>

The British market, which is the chief one for Danish hog products, had been recently cut down by a policy of import duties and restrictions of every sort. The price of Danish hog products began to slump disastrously. Well, in the end the Danish government was forced to buy the bacon and pork from the Danish farmers just as the Dutch government had had to buy up the wheat. And now the Danish government was faced with the problem. It was clear that the hog products could not be used for human consumption. And so in despair the Danish government decided to process them and thus to make them into manure. And this was actually done. The manure factories of Denmark were put into operation, and very soon they had turned out a very largely increased supply of splendid fertilizer for the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But now the third difficulty arose. What was to be done with the fertilizer ? There were no farmers in Europe who wanted to intensify their cultivation or extend their acreage. It didn’t seem possible to find any market for the fertilizer at all. The Danish government was in a terrible quandary. So at last, and in desperation, they reopened negotiations with the Dutch government. And the Dutch government finally bought back the fertilizer, though, of course, at a ruinously low' price, and put it back onto the soil which had been reclaimed from the Zuyder Zee. And so you see the fertilizer went back just exactly where it came from.—John Strachey, in an address in New York (some time ago) under the auspices of the American League Against War and Fascism. Since this address was given Strachey was refused permission tc lecture in the U. S. A. because of fear of his ideas. »</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ When Joachim Hambro, president of Nor-. way’s parliament, landed in Brooklyn recently, for a tour of the United States, he kidded the alleged statesmen of this fair and happy land to a finish by the remark that &quot;Norway is still obsolete in many ways: there is still a surplus in the budget”. It seems that the Norwegian parliament, instead of being made up of yes meh, is made up of persons that know Something and are really interested in their country.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark107"></a>France and the Hierarchy</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Of course, France was for long a hotbed of Boman Catholicism; In the fourteenth century the popes actually had their residence in the south of France at the great castle of Avignon. Every student of history also knows of the terrible massacre of the French Protestants, the Huguenots, on St. Bartholomew’s eve. Another evidence of the power of the Hierarchy in France in the past still exists in the Palais Royal, in the center of Paris, one of the attractions of the French capital. This vast palace, with its extensive gardens, was built by Cardinal Richelieu, and there he lived in state with his 3(X) servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After the French Revolution a great change eame over the country. Today Roman Catholicism is still fighting to retain and regain its hold on the people. Recently, buying a Paris edition of a daily paper in the streets, I was at first surprised to find it containing a special column exclusively devoted to Roman Catholic news. Then I noticed that the paper is the organ of the Fascist leader; which explains it all. Here is one of the news items it contained, which will be of interest and amusement to many:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A scientific and religious expedition to the Polar Circle. Washington : Two priests, Father Dutilly, attached to the Catholic University of Washington, and Father Dumas, scientist and botanist, are undertaking an expedition to the lands situated at the extremities of Hudson Bay, inhabited by Esquimaux.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">.After the missionary work of evangelization, the two priests will gather plants, minerals and various objects intended for the missionary museum of Lateran, at Rome, The collection will be studied and catalogued the following winter in the laboratories of the. Catholic University.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Visiting the local museum, a large oil painting caught my eye. It was entitled “Les Semi-naristes”, and represented a number of Roman Catholic priests promenading together. I was alone at the moment on the top floor of the building, and without reflecting what might be the consequences 1 turned to the attendant and said to him in his own language, “I don’t admire these fellows.” To my surprise he re-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">20</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">plied, “Well, I am a Protestant myself.” Thus an opportunity to witness to the Kingdom was presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Finally, here is a particularly intriguing piece of news from a reliable British pioneer, in the south of France. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Two days ago it was announced on the wireless here that the pope was sounding the French government with a view to coining to France to take refuge in the old castle of the popes at Avignon, or in some other place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Further, there is a report that one of the big stores in Paris has been busy making civil clothes for priests and nuns, and that they havg their grips packed so as to be able to make a quick get-away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If such be the case, how futile will be their efforts; for is it not written, ‘There shall he no way of escape,’ and again, “Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yes, Jehovah’s victory is certain. Carry on, British pioneers in France. Carry on, French witnesses and companions. bVe </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">vous effrayez point: car e’est Dicu qui combattra.’</span><span class="font7"> ‘Be not afraid: The  battle is God’s.’ — F. R. Freer, Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Vatican Policy</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The Vatican’s policy toward the Japanese form of Fascism is extremely interesting— and shocking, to Americans. The reader may remember the alarming headlines of October </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">14 </span><span class="font7">and lb, 1937, over an Associated Press story quoting “a reliable Vatican source” saying that the Holy See, in carrying out the Catholic Church’s world-wide campaign against Bolshevism, had “instructed its hierarchy and missions in the Far East to co-operate with Japanese action in China”. Most likely the information came from the Vatican’s Monsignor Pueci, who for decades has been the American journalistic corps’ informer on Catholic policy. The dispatch quoted the Vatican source, saying the memorandum promises “to give Japanese military authorities the clear impression that on the part of the Catholic Church there is no obstacle to complete collaboration”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This statement was denied immediately </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font7">Rome. But not in Tokyo. The Associated Press not only reaffirmed the absolute truth of its story but revealed the fact it had asked for and received complete verification before sending out the original. It is also interesting to note that a year earlier The Times had written that “the feeling in China and in the Philippines amongst Catholic missioners has been that they will get a fair deal and freedom</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION </span><span class="font7">to push their religion should Japanese get control”, and again, that “the Vatican is also intensely interested in the development of her relations with Japan in order to get control of the eventual development of Christianity in those parts of China which she believes will one day come under Japanese influences”. And, of course, the Vatican can fight Russia best with Japan's help. Hitler and Mussolini know that very well.—George Seldes, in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The New Republic.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Is It True? It Is </span><span class="font7">♦ In Catalonia, while being received by a group of moderate republicans made up of men and women of various ages, I was asked by one woman the following anxious question: “Is it true that in your country the Catholics are our great enemies?” Carefully and painfully, with an attempt at mitigation I told them what I am sure will be recognized as the truth. I told them that one American prelate had declared that he prays daily for Franco’s victory. A gasp of sponse to this. I told them that another American prelate had declared that Franco could not be guilty of bombings because he was a “Christian gentleman”. The expression was received with wondering eyes and open mouths. When I finished, did these “godless Reds” curse the Church? They did not. They all remained still and bowed their heads in utter, silent grief. Whatever happens, the Church has lost Spain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As I sailed away from Europe, these words of an Irish worker echoed in my ears: “There must be something very secret and mysterious about this Spanish war that I don’t understand, because in this fight the Church is on the side that seems so clearly and terribly wrong.”—Ephraim Cross, in the Washington Post.</span></p>

He should visit Sydney, Australia, where he will find that Roman Catholics in power excluded Judge Rutherford from the Town Hall, which, however, is always available for use by the Roman Hierarchy or by German Fascists. He should visit Seattle, Washington, where the Roman Catholic Hierarchy made a desperate effort, but in vain, to prevent the holding of a public meeting of great importance addressed by the same international speaker. He should visit New Orleans, Louisiana, where the tools of the Roman Hierarchy actually threatened to murder Christians in cold blood if they insisted on their rights to listen to the same speaker by radio.

<p><span class="font7">Important news from the New Zealand </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Tablet.</span><span class="font7"> It relates that during the World War certain Relics of Louis IX, king of France, were stolen from the Paris church</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">of St. Louis en lie. Now, after some twentyodd years, the stolen relics have been replaced by part of Louis’ jawbone, which he no longer needs, a sleeve of one of his old shirts, which is also out of style in his present environment, and a steel whip of five chains with which he used to larrup himself every Friday until he finally got over such perfect and absolute foolishness.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark114"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark115"></a>Best Not to Get Too Fresh \</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">' ♦ The London </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald</span><span class="font7"> gleefully published numerous lies about Judge Rutherford, but, when threatened with heavy libel damages, backed down and published a retraction on their front page. Jehovah’s witnesses then cheerfully put out 50,000 copies of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font7"> No. 504, which told the story*, and backed that up with 2,000,000 leaflets, telling the story to that many more Britishers. This last brought out the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font7"> with an admission that it was feeling the heat, but did not “know who Judge Rutherford is, or what he stands for”, and, “We can do little in reply, due to lack of funds and system.” All of which suggests the old adage that when you are monkeying around a buzz saw, it is best not to get too fresh. You might lose a few fingers or something, and get laughed at too.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ You don’t have to believe it, but if you want to believe it the “True Crown of Thorns” will be taken from Paris to Villeneuve this summer. If you want to believe it you have the right to believe that this alleged “True Crown of Thorns” came to Paris from Palestine in 1239 and has been kept in a glass tube with a fragment of the true cross and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">nail from the cross.

<p><span class="font7">♦ As fast as the totalitarian monstrosity feels ready to grip the throat of a country it seems that one of the first things it does is to comply with the pope’s wish that all Freemasonry shall be throttled. This has now been done in Poland; all Masonic property has been confiscated and the proceeds turned over to Catholic institutions. Yet today, in Seattle, New Orleans and everywhere else the Masonic fraternity is glad at any time to give Jehovah’s witnesses a stab in the back at the same time that it bestows the glad hand on the emissaries of the pope.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ Ever since the days of Nebuchadnezzar, and before them, too, the Devil has been urging more and bigger statues, so that the common people would have something to worship besides the Most High God, Creator of heaven and earth. Accordingly the largest “religious”, statue in the world, 110 feet high, styled “Our Lady of the Sacred Heart”, is being erected near Lyons, France.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">One of </span><span class="font7">the pacifists, Lawrence Murfitt, saw , that expression and wrote a 20-page booklet ' entitled “For Christ’s Sake” in which he gave some more explicit information regarding the “young women” above mentioned.

<p><span class="font7">In the regimental bazaars (i.e., brothels) it is necessary to have a sufficient number of women, to take care that they are sufficiently attractive, to provide them with proper houses, and above all to insist upon means of ablution always being available. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Now, it seems that it Is all wrong for young women to be driven mad with shame when the Germans attack the Belgians, but when the British attack the Afghans it is quite different, and in that case, one may suppose, the “Reverend” Phythian-Adams would feel that no greater honor eould come to a member of his Sunday-school class than to find a field of usefulness such as indicated in Memorandum 21a.</span></p>

Loose feathers fluttered in the bars of golden sunshine that streaked down through the pines and birches, and with its little gray feet clutching nervously, life left the body of the old cock partridge. Then and there in that sun-streaked woods a strange feeling swept over me. I stroked the gorgeous plumage of the dead bird and slowly pushed the fallen monarch of the ridges into a pocket of my hunting coat. A mile of forest - rimmed meadow land separated me from my automobile. With every step my sorrow grew. By the time I reached my car I was heart- ** broken over my deed.</span></p>

This particular guillemot got tangled in some oil, could no longer fly, and a kindhearted swimmer brought him ashore and washed him up with soap and warm water and, when he was dry, gently placed him back in the ocean.

<p><span class="font7">♦ More and more evidence accumulates that America was populated from Asia, and that not so many centuries ago either. A California man and his Japanese wife recently made the trip from Shanghai to Los Angeles in a 36-foot Chinese junk, navigated entirely by the stars and the compass. The Japan Current, which sweeps from Japan around to California via Alaska and British Columbia, is a natural means of travel between Asiatic and American shores. When American Indians and Japanese men arc dressed alike they can hardly be told apart.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ A farm hand in California threw' a pan of hot ashes into a clump of dry brush. It resulted in a Ore that destroyed more than $5,000,000 worth of property and left 20,000 acres of beautiful woodlands a mass of charred ruins. Scores of frightened deer lost their lives jumping from cliffs, where they had been cor-</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MAY 31, 1939 </span><span class="font7">nered by the flames. All together, it was too bad that the farm hand did not make some use of the fungus growth above his ears.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">HE Catholic Hierarchy and her hordes are beginning to come out in full force against Jehovah’s faithful people. Last Friday the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Universe</span><span class="font7"> in all its various editions in Scotland, England, and Ireland published a large front-page article titled “Judge Rutherford’s Attack on the Church”. It goes on to say, “As a matter of policy the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Universe </span><span class="font7">usually ignores organizations which attack the Church, on the supposition that the attack will fail by its own absurdity if left alone but would thrive on publicity. Judge Rutherford’s attack upon the Church is, however, on such a scale that it cannot be ignored. The country is being, flooded with literature imported from the U.S.A. by the ton. For the ■past few months London and several other great towns have been suffering from a plague of Watchtower pamphlets; the most noteworthy being a tract entitled ‘Face the Facts’, which is often accompanied with other leaflets and more or less provocative appeals.” The article continues at some length and as a whole gives a good witness to the Catholic population of the forward movement of Jehovah’s Kingdom organization.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark147"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark148"></a>Special Attack at Clydebank</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">In view of the recent series of assaults committed in Clydebank, Judge Rutherford gave instructions for a special campaign there last Sunday. This was the first specially organized attack in this country executed on the New Jersey style in retaliation to the movements of the enemy. Last Sunday 200 faithful courageous Scotch witnesses reported for special duty at the West Glasgow Kingdom Hall. After a brief period of instruction as to, field tactics they entered the five special buses in squads of four. The squads were numbered according to their territory assignment and entered their respective buses. In twenty minutes all the two hundred publishers were delivered at their territory by squads of four. Each squad of four had to make 120 calls. In one hour the entire district of 6,000 homes in Clydebank was thoroughly covered. A special leaflet was left in each home. See a copy herewith, Which should be read. All the companies in Scotland are being sent a consign* meat of these special folders to thoroughly distribute in their territories during the month. In addition to the leaflets 1,400 booklets were left in Clydebank and many people of good will were found. AU together, ten assaults were made on the witnesses during this campaign and the entire police force of Clydebank which had previously been notified was on the job. One mob of three hundred just leaving the Catholic Church seriously assaulted a pioneer witness who afterwards was taken to a doctor for examination. In two cases people of good will definitely came forward to-pro-tect and take the side of the witnesses in these assaults. One Catholic lady said she didn’t agree with our message but certainly was disgusted with the method of violence the Catholies were resorting to. This campaign demonstrated to the people of good will in Clydebank that the Lord definitely has a people and that they will not be intimidated nor threatened to silence by the Catholic organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Also at zone assembly at Folkestone a group of forty Catholies attended the public meeting and caused a disturbance. Order was finally restored after the police came on the scene. The public hall in Camberley was canceled at the last minute by the religionists and thus succeeded in stopping the “Fascism or Freedom” lecture in that town. There is now abundant evidence that Catholic Action throughout Britain is moving in open opposition against the Lord’s people. This calls for still greater effort on the part of each one to get this message in the hands of the people before Armageddon begins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The month should be a full month of Kingdom activity. When introducing the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font7"> booklets tell the people that these are anti-Fascist booklets. When pavement witnessing also tell the people this and you will find you can place many more booklets. For some reason the people think we are Fascists and we must plainly tell them otherwise. The sound-cars should also freely announce the anti-Fascist nature of the booklets and the meetings being held. Every publisher should put forth a real effort to get at least one more </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> subscription before the end of the period. Kingdom warfare needs more pioneers. Why not join now while the battle is warm?</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Employer-Fostered Lawlessness</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">zg-^ </span><span class="font7">A most disturbing recent phenomenon is the attempt by many employers to weld the entire eommu-nity in which a business is located into a united front against workers <sub>s</sub> exercising their constitutional right to strike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many times this community pressure against unionization has actually been highly organized even before strike action has token place or is in contemplation. All areas of our country have contributed their quoto to an alarming growth of the vigilante spirit, in which the employer's will to destroy the union is substituted for the protection normally accorded American citizens in the exercise of constitutionally guaranteed prerogatives. So-called ‘campaigns for law and order’ are many times merely a mask behind which the private will of a corporation, utheizing its economic threat of withdrawal from the community, succeeds in toking the law, including the Law enforcement officers, into its own hands and for its own purpose's. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">, A continuing outcrop of this sort of employer-fostered lawlessness gives aid and encouragement to the antics of such public officials as Mayor Hague, who in complete disregard of civil liberties wages his crusade against organized labor under the trumpery and hypocritical claim that he is protecting the citizens of New Jersey against an inva-si on of radicals bent on revolutionary action. As a matter of known fact, anti-union employers have been lured to Jersey City for years on the plea that if would be kept an open-shop town. Mayor Hague’s slogan of Americanism versus Communism has a very practical economic basis. Even the most conservative of Americans are obliged to hold their noses in the face of Hague’s affronts to decency and to American political traditions. While a single politician of this sort may ride to a downfall as a result of his ■ egregious escapades, the fact that Mayor Hague could have ventured so far and so freely is an indication of the extent to which anti-union propaganda issued on behalf of employers may result in substontial threats to our democratic system of government,— Edwin S. Smith, of the National Labor Relations Board, in an address in Boston,</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">British Comment</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:itolic;">By J. Hemery (London)</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark149"></a>Political Situation</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">• The movements of vast and well-equipped militory armies on the continent of Europe, and the latest use by Hitler of his militory machine, in Memel, is having the effect in Britoin of crowding to get tier the differing political leaders. This was very noticeable in Parliament when Premier Chamberlain ’ announced the decision, of the Government to make a war pact with Poland. Hitler, by his absorption of Czechoslovakia .and the. compulsory economic agreements with the southeastern countries of Europe, has roused the fears of the leaders in politics and finance, and action to prevent further aggression became a matter of urgent moment for the Government, Chamberlain hurriedly dropped further attempts to appease Hitler, and as his new' attitude towards the Nazi policy .is much more like that wdiieh the Labor party has, and -which dissentients in his own party also had, there is general agreement. As Poland is determined that the least aggression on its territory will be considered an act of war, and as the Poles are well equipped for war (and it is said they rather like a fight), and as Hitler is apparently subjected to violent tempers, it is readily seen that very great events may follow from very small actions. The situation is probably much more dangerous than in last September. All this means more money must go into armaments; less attention to the remedying of social evils, and a lessening of the civil amenities of the people; and, too, that general conscription of the property of individuals as well as of persons gets ominously near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is no sense of alarm nor even excitement in Britoin ; nothing at all comparable to that which existed in September, when all London, almost, lined up for gas-masks, even though the actual situation may be said to be more touchy to war. Unemployment figures are less, and the Government purposes to subsidize some shipping interests and also to put out orders in the idle shipbuilding yards. As was to be expected -when the war tolk should become prominent, the parsons are beginning to put on their moral militory rearmament. When the Great War was over and its after-effects were heavy to be endured all the preachers and parsons were pacifists, or so they said. But w'ith Hitler’s rise to power the “war to end war” seemed to be . rising from its ashes, with the certointy that the parsons would be compelled to toke a definite position as followers of Christ, whose name they have token to themselves, and refuse to fight, or keep their desired reputotion as good citizens, and their churches as importont factors in the welfare of the country. They began to find good reasons for supporting a war of defense: surely it must be a Christian duty to fight for the defense of the homes of the people. Now they are ready for the next step, and, finding a moral argument in the atrocities being committed, and the fear of many more, and also that their religious institutions are in danger of being Hitlerized, they are getting ready for the offensive action w<sup>r</sup>hicli may be token by the Government. A Nonconformist preacher of Leicester tells the Peace Pledge Union, through his church magazine, not to send him any more; pacifist literature. He will throw any that comes into the fire, “the most suitoble place for stuff of that kind.” He sees no peace for the worljl unthe the tw'o bullies of Europe are incarcerated, either in madhouse or in jail; says pious platitudes are useless as a means of stopping their ruthless aggression and cruel persecution of their victims, and he wants a combination of powerful forces which can stop these bullies -with like weapons, and force the war-makers to cry halt. JTe says, “Tn that effort I am at-my country’s service.” There is every reason to think he speaks as for the great majority of the clergy of al] the sects. There will be nothing left for them if they do not toke an active part as before, nor will there be anything left for them if they do. They have joined them-■ selves to the world and will certoinly perish</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">in the destruction of this day of Jehovah God. The time is on when Jesus’ words shall have their great fulfillment: He said, “They that toke the sword shall perish with the sword.”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark150"></a>Roman Catholicism and Criminals</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">• “Reverend Father” Fitzgerald, a former prison chaplain for the Roman Catholic church, writes to his favorite Catholic newspaper to show that the religion ho represents is the most popular religion amongst</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">the criminal class. He says, “It has become a recognized fact that the Catholic religion is the most popular in the criminal class.” That is a nice way of stating a rather ugly fact. To put it another way, it might be said that there are more criminals in jails who claim to be Roman Catholics than of any other religion. The “father” says this is because the Catholic church never lets its members down; it looks after them in prison, to seek to save their souls. Probably it would be more truthful to say the visiting “fathers” look to their criminals in the interests of the “church” partly because the numerous criminals must be counted in the reported statistics of the church, and also to parade the care which the church professes to have for the erring and the fallen and the vicious members of the communities. It wants to have the people believe that it is the world’s greatest moral influence. There are many who assert that the Roman Catholic church has been a great demoralizing power through all the long centuries of its existence. As the world’s greatest religion it has admittedly the preeminence of position and age, and if religion were a moralizing influence there might be some reason for admitting some of its claims. But the facts of history show that where that church has been in the ascendant the standards of morality have been low, and that it has given much more attention to its own interests as a church than to the welfare of the people either moral or physical. The &quot;father”, in his eulogy of his church, says, “It is easy to explain the church’s hold on the criminal classes; for the church has a wider influence than any other in the whole universe.” In other words, the church understands the mentality of the criminal classes better than any other. Agreed! Certainly: it has had more experience.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark151"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark152"></a>Religion Demoralizes</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">• Religionists themselves have debunked their religion: they accept for-themselves that what is commonly accepted as morality and religion are the same in effect. But religion is not a moral thing. Its foundation is not truth, but errors, perversions of the Word of God, the holy Scriptures, and additions thereto. Its great organizations paraded before men are the devices of men led by or deceived by the Devil, the enemy of God and the truth. Its &quot;ministers” in the case of so-called “Protestantism” accept among themselves a moral</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MAY 31, 1939 </span><span class="font7">ity that allows them to be unfaithful to their’ own vow<sup>r</sup>s when “ordained”, and in the case of Rome to put on a glory of state, which is seen in the Papal glory unequaled in the earth. The Word of God is explained away, lost in “moralizing”. The records of Israel, given by God himself, through &quot;holy men of old”, show that as that people became religious they became hypocrites and depraved; and when at last God sent His Son to speak the truth to them they slew Him. to put Him out of their sight, and that they might not be tormented by the truth. Religion has had the same effect through the centuries, even though it has actually been practiced in His name.. But it is Christianity, the teachings of Jesus, followed in loyal devotion to God, and by the aid of His spirit, that elevates a man and brings him into the image of Him who created him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Variety</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">• The Luton </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">News,</span><span class="font7"> under the question note, “Who was the donor?” says: “During the discussion on the Christian religion (sic) one' of the correspondents, Mr. Norman Hill, referred to the High Town Fellowship as the’ ‘Holy smoke Bible class’. One night this week, while the fellowship was in session someone surreptitiously placed in the porch of the church a chimney pot inscribed, ‘Presented to the Holy smoke Bible class.’ The donor left no clue, but one of the members gladly carried it home, having some use for it. The secretary of the fellowship denies that the class is a Bible class.” Of course; anyone professing to be religious is said to be welcome in this church company, and tobacco is certainly one of the readiest means of “mixing”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A Nonconformist religious weekly gives a picture of some preachers receiving gas-pro-teetion instruction. Each with a mask on, the picture looked all right; but a still better one would be one that would show a mask to keep the gas in. It cannot now be far ahead when these men will stop their much speaking, and will hide their clerical garments and don some that will make them , look like agricultural laborers, as the prophet</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Zechariah says. See Zechariah 13 :3-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Scene: Barber shop in Clydach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Customer No. 1 (pro-religionist): All religious people make good use of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Customer No. 2 (anti-religionist, derisively): Possibly so; in fact, I can give you interesting instances of this. In one religious</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">fantily I know the Bible is used to keep insurance policies and other documents; for there they are safe, for the reason that no one opens the Bible to read it. Another respectable religious family man has converted his family Bible, with its large covers and massive brass clasps, into a clothes press for his boys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Outrages</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">• The terrible series of outrages against the communities of England perpetrated by the Irish Republican Army are having a repercussion on the Roman Catholics. A letter to which the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Tinies</span><span class="font7"> gives prominence makes an endeavor to show that the Roman Catholic church should not be considered as having anything but utter abhorrence in this matter. The trouble arises from the fact that the Irish Republican Army professes to be religious—the Roman Catholic variety. Says the letter: “Its menace is its pretense that it is Catholicism . . . the soldier of the.republic is taught that he must on all occasions parade his devotion in the ceremonies of the church.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">. He must be a knight of the Blessed Sacrament; he must distinguish himself in frequentation of the sacraments but must never in confession mention anything he has done by order of the 'Sovereign State’, for that cannot be a sin.” They are getting -ahead of the pope and all church authority in this. The soldier is told that after a successful crime he must go to a shrine and burn candles and rattle rosary beads to impress prospective recruits - with the holiness of the cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This exaltation of the ‘Republic’ above the authority of the priesthood hits the church in the same spot as is made sore by Hitler; but in this ease the blow comes from those who claim to be ardent servants of the church. One wonders why the Hierarchy in Britain has not already disowned these impossible men and women who are destroying lives and the property of a country that has given them hospitality and who are of the worst offenders in the criminal class. Perhaps “Reverend Father” Fitzgerald is trying to reform these erring Roman Catholics.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark153"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark154"></a>Exalting the Pope</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">• A Roman Catholic writer says: “There is still hope for the world, and of peace for all nations. . . . There is one who stands above all strife, and who can speak for the common people of all nations, and appeal to all 30 governments without being suspected of partisanship. We mean our holy father pope Pius 12. The Vatican is the tiny plot of earth which can redeem the rest of the world from a blood bath. There the nations can assemble! in confidence. Wo feel that there can now be no peace except a pope’s peace. Already a fellow Christian (the archbishop of Canterbury) has proclaimed his readiness to turn the world, with their eyes to Rome. In all the turmoil of the past few weeks the Papacy has kept silent. The pope will act in his own time—and the eyes of the hierarchy are ever watchful.” He continues, “The moral ascendancy of St. Peter’s successor is as high as at any time in history. The silent diplomatic service of the Vatican is one of the most active in the world . . . pope Pius himself is a diplomat of the first rank and he may play a decisive part.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">In seeking to excuse the pope’s silence and the Vatican’s refusal to take the action which its claimed position should cause it to take in the terrible afflictions multitudes in Europe are suffering by the actions of ruthless governors, this Roman Catholic writer has said some things that are good to be published. The late pope said much about his desire for the peace of the world, and in what little the present pope has said the same thing has been expressed. But the above-quoted writer says truly that what they want is a pope’s peace. And a truer word has not been written than his statement that the Hierarchy at Rome is ever watchful. But those men are watching for their time, and the world must be left in its trouble till then. The pope has chosen his cabinet. It is this seieeted company of men who are ever working silently and whose decisions are now and again voiced by the pope. Their secret agents are set through the earth, and are kept in closest union with the rulers of the church in Rome. The peace of the world is not the first objective: that is altogether secondary to the advancement of the Papal authority over the nations. When the world’s trouble has got worse and the point of time for the Hierarchy to speak has come, then there will be no hesitancy, and the pope will be put forward as the father of peace. “He may play a decisive part,” says this advocate. Probably he will for the short time before the judgments of God fall upon that great system and upon all other religious organizations in the commencement of the destruction of Armageddon, now hastening on.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Estonia’s Form of Dictatorship</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ A correspondent in Estonia explains that his country is still under a dictator, but has the appearance of a democracy. This is how it is done: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The dictator is the same person as previously, but has the title of president under a constitution so formed that he may rule as it so pleases him, or ignore most of the provisions of the constitution and rule in any other way, if it pleases him better. The constitution itself provides the president with such powers. Now he has the appearance . of the stamp of public approval to back him up. No other candidate was nominated for the presidency than the former dictator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is no censorship of the press,' but woe to</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">States &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ -, -</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">the man who dares to write slightingly of or to criticize the president or any other high official of the government, or to write anything displeasing to the government. Heavy fine or liquidation of the business is the sure result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The president may be honest in his efforts to guide the destiny of the nation, and afraid that if the people had much to say about the affairs of state they might run into complications with the big powers, and may think that he is able, if he can dictate the running of things, to avoid the complications. But allowing that, there still' remains the fact that Estonia is governed by a dictatorship having a form of democracy, all a hypocritical arrangement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">I believe also that the Swedish people are content because of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
