<p><span class="font2">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death In order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION Is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark7"></a>DOOM OF RELIGION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour; but through knowledge shall the just be delivered.&quot; —Prov. 11: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">JEHOVAH made known to Abraham his unilateral covenant, thereby disclosing his purpose to set</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font5"> up a government through which all persons of good will toward God and his government might enjoy everlasting blessings. (Gen. 12:1-3) Every creature or thing that is in opposition to that government of Jehovah is necessarily the enemy of Almighty God. Satan, “that old serpent,” the Devil, is the arch enemy of Jehovah, and long ago Satan chose religion as his chief means of defaming God’s name to the end that he might turn the people against God. Manifestly Satan chose religion for that purpose because it is the most subtle means of deceiving the people. By means of religion Satan has made many hypocrites of men, and such hypocrites by the use of “good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple”. Probably no other man was so well qualified to speak the words above quoted as the apostle Paul, who used the same as a warning to all persons who sincerely desire to walk in the right way. At one time Paul was a practitioner of the Jews’ religion and until the Lord revealed to him the truth, and then Paul became a Christian and an outstanding apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ. He shows that men who practice religion and teach it to others turn away from God those who give heed to their doctrines. Hence Paul wrote to the true followers of Christ Jesus this admonition, to wit: “Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them. For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.”—Rom. 16:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">* That a hypocrite is despicable in the sight of God is made sure by that which is written in God’s Word. In the book of Job it is written that three religionists came to Job when he was afflicted and during his period of suffering, and pretended to comfort Job, but, in fact, were there to torment him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Job was truly devoted to and trusted in God. To those hypocrites Job said: “Though he [God] slay me, yet will I trust in him; but I will maintain mine own ways before him. He also shall be my salvation; for an hypocrite shall not come before him.” —Job 13:15,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Job was a type of those afterwards who have devoted themselves to God. Those who practice hypocrisy prosper temporarily, but not for long. “For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul? Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?” (Job 27:8,9) In God’s kingdom no hypocrite shall have any part whatsoever: “That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.” (Job 34:30) The scribes and Pharisees were the religious leaders of the Jews, and they taught the people the doctrines of men, although they claimed to be servants of Jehovah God. Because of their hypocrisy Jesus denounced them and, amongst other things, said to them: “Ye hypocrites! well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.” (Matt. 15:7-9) These scriptures show beyond any question that a hypocrite is an abomination in God’s sight and that religion is hypocritical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">* Satan’s name “Serpent” means Deceiver, and he is the great Deceiver of others, and particularly of those who are impressed with their own importance, and those who are of simple mind. From the time of Eve till now the Devil has used religion to deceive people. Religious teachers have fallen into the snare of the Devil, and he has ever used them to mislead the credulous persons, causing them to go into complete darkness. With the nation of Israel God established the true worship of Jehovah in spirit and in truth, and he specifically warned that people to avoid religion because religion is the snare of the Devil. (Deut. 7:16) Jehovah established with</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the Jews the true worship for their own protection, and thereby established his rule with those who please him; and those who have his blessing avoid religion and worship God in spirit and in truth. The Jewish nation failed to give heed to God’s warning against religion because their leaders were unfaithful to their commission, and the result was that Israel fell into the snare of the Devil and that nation suffered complete destruction. Such is the end of all hypocrites. The “evil servant” class, the Lord declares, will receive the same recompense as that appointed to hypocrites. (Matt. 24:50,51) Those who continue the practice of religion after having received from God due warning are certain to suffer complete destruction. Such warning God causes to be given in his due time to those who practice religion that they might have the opportunity to turn away from religion and serve God in spirit and in truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS NAME</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">* In the fight that Satan makes against God it is the name of the Most High that is involved. Jehovah is the source of life, and from him all true blessings flow. Satan has wickedly opposed God, seeking adulation for himself. In due time Jehovah will express his wrath completely against Satan. But before expressing his great wrath against the Devil Jehovah gives full and complete notice of that fact. For that reason Jehovah in the beginning said to Satan: &quot;For this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.” (Ex. 9:16) The name of Jehovah, which means his purpose toward his creatures, must be proclaimed or declared throughout the earth immediately preceding Armageddon, at which battle of Armageddon the power of Jehovah will be made known to all, and it will result in the complete destruction of Satan and all his agencies. That God must use someone to declare his name is made certain by the Scriptures, because that is his will. Therefore it is written: ‘God at first did visit the nations to take out from them a people for his name.’ This great truth he revealed to his servants in due time, and under inspiration of the spirit of Jehovah his servant uttered these words, as it is written: “Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles [non-Israelites], to take out of them a people for his name. And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up; that the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things. Known unto God are all his works, from the beginning of the world.” —Acts 15:14-18.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> it is therefore clear that the progressive program of the Almighty is this: God did set up his typical government or nation with David as his chief servant on earth; David was a type of Christ Jesus, the rightful and true ruler of the world; the typical government served its purpose and came to an end, at which time the last king of Israel was overthrown, and thereafter the typical began to have its fulfillment. That typical government ended, and Christ Jesus, having come as the Vindicator of Jehovah’s name and his spokesman, began to take out from amongst the nations a people for Jehovah’s name, and when that people is selected then God sets up or builds up his real government with the anti typical David, Christ Jesus, as the Chief One and Lord thereof. Then follows the work of the Lord in selecting his “other sheep”, which are known as the &quot;great multitude” and who call upon his name. All of this program was known to and determined upon by Jehovah God from the beginning. Those prophetic statements set forth in the Scriptures concerning setting up of the government of Jehovah are now about fulfilled. God has taken out from the nations a people for his name, which people, including the Ruth and Esther class, “the residue,” are made his witnesses, and now the Lord Jesus Christ is gathering unto himself his “other sheep”, who call upon his name. The entire program has to do with the name of the Most High, and will result in the complete vindication of his holy name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>T</sup>Why has God taken out from the nations a “people for his name”? The answer is, as shown by the Scriptures: This he does in order that they may give testimony to the people of and concerning Jehovah’s name and purpose. They must be witnesses to the name of Jehovah, declaring to the people that he is the Almighty God and the only source of life. To those taken out, and who now constitute the remnant of his people on earth, Jehovah says: &quot;Ye are my witnesses . . . that I am God.” (Isa. 43:10,12) Those who have been taken out have no alternative as to what they shall do. They must be witnesses to the name of Jehovah, regardless of what any creature may think or say or do concerning them. it is the will of God that notice must be served upon the nations of the earth, informing them that he is supreme and that his name is above all names and that at Armageddon he will destroy all that continue in opposition to him. Those persons so taken out are designated in the Scriptures as “a peculiar people”, “a people for a purpose.” For what purpose? To show forth the praises of Jehovah God by declaring his name and his kingdom. (1 Pet. 2:9,10) Such witnesses, that is, the people taken out for his name, are commissioned by the Lord Jehovah to declare “the day of vengeance [vindication] of our God”. (Isa. 61:1,2) When must this specific command be carried out? At the time of the return of Christ Jesus, the antitypical David, when he appears and begins to set up the kingdom of Jehovah. The great anti typical David, Christ Jesus, did return in A.D. 1914, and in 1918 he came to the temple and there began the building up of Zion, concerning which all of God’s prophets had foretold. (Mal. 3:1-3; Ps. 102:16) The return of Christ Jesus, and the beginning of his kingdom, was and is good news or gospel to all who love righteousness. Therefore the Lord gave this commandment to the people so taken out for Jehovah’s name, to wit: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.”—Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> The foregoing text of Acts 15:14-18 shows that the only ones that are going to be saved before and at Armageddon are those who constitute the kingdom class and the great multitude. The foregoing concerning the setting up of the kingdom is fully corroborated by the following text: “And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you; whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began. For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people. Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel, and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.”— Acts 3:20-24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> it is manifestly clear from the foregoing text that the word “restitution”, or “restoration” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(A.R.V.), </span><span class="font5">here does not refer to men who foil because of sin; but it does mean the restoration of the kingdom that had fallen down and concerning which all the prophets foretold in the prophecies uttered by them at God’s command. The setting up of the kingdom is the important thing for the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and those who call upon the name of the Lord then shall have the blessed opportunity to obey him and receive life everlasting. it is the kingdom that the faithful men of old looked for and had hope of its coming, and because of their faith and hope they endured all manner of persecution and yet remained faithful and true to Jehovah God. (Heb. 11:14-16) Of course, the restoration or setting up of the ‘kingdom which has fallen down’ also means the restoration of all the truths concerning the kingdom, which were hidden by reason of men’s resorting to religion and thus being turned away from the truth. It, therefore, is conclusively shown by the Scriptures that religionists have no interest in the kingdom of God, but are in opposition to it, and that those who practice religion in the name of God and in the name of Christ Jesus are hypocrites.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> In the foregoing text, Acts 3:19,20, the apostle said: “Times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.” This emphasizes the fact that the second coming of the Lord and the kingdom is the great important doctrine of the Bible, because it is through the kingdom God’s name is vindicated. His coming and his kingdom, therefore, is a time of great refreshing to all who are on the side of Jehovah, first to those who are called according to his purpose to be members of The Christ, and later to the “other sheep” of the Lord, the Jonadabs, who are now being gathered unto the Lord. The remnant and the Jonadabs as companions are now rejoicing together in performing the duties which the Lord has given them to perform.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DATE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> Particularly since the year 1918 those consecrated persons who are really and truly devoted to God and his kingdom have been obeying the commandment by going among the people and declaring the name of the Most High and his King and kingdom. The declaration of these great truths of and concerning God and his kingdom under Christ has necessarily exposed the wrongful course of the practitioners of religion. The truth has shown up that religion is a fraud and a snare. The religionists, being offended at the truth, have charged and continue to charge that Jehovah’s witnesses carry on a campaign of hate and choose to make others their enemies. Jehovah’s witnesses are not engaged in any campaign of hate. They have no controversy and no fight with men. They have no disposition or desire to do injury to men. They are acting strictly in obedience to God's commandment to proclaim his name and his kingdom. They do not hate men; but they do hate evil or wickedness, which has defamed God's name and brought great sorrow and suffering upon men. They hate what God hates, and God hates wickedness; as it is written: “These six things doth the Lord hate; yea, seven are an abomination unto him: a proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, an heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, a false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.'’ (Prov. 6:16-19) it is those who practice religion that indulge in hatred of their fellow creatures who tell the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> All who love God hate evil or wickedness, but they do not hate the people who have been led into wickedness by Satan the wicked one. (Prov. 1:7; 8:13) The proper heart attitude of all who love God is stated by the prophet in these words: “Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way. I hate vain thoughts; but thy law do I love. Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way. I hate and abhor lying; but thy law do I love.” —Ps. 119:104,113,128,163.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> The honest person hates everything that does injury to his fellow creatures and that defames the name of Almighty God. He does not hate any person because that person has been induced to practice any particular religion; but he does hate the religion, for the reason that it is false and defames God’s name and works great injury to mankind. Religion is the creation of the Devil brought into action to defame God’s name, and he deceives men for the very purpose of defaming God’s name and doing injury to mankind. Only the truth can relieve mankind from such condition of blindness, and therefore those who proclaim the truth at God’s command are doing good. Jehovah’s witnesses love mankind, and for that reason they endeavor to inform the people what is for their best interest. The testimony given by Jehovah’s witnesses, which exposes the duplicity and crookedness of religion, they give because God’s will is that they shall do so. Their testimony is not their own, but that which proceeds from Jehovah. If one tells his neighbor that a lion is about to attack him and to destroy him, surely that information is not given because of hatred of his neighbor, but because of love for him. Say the Scriptures: “The devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.” (1 Pet. 5:8) The Devil is likened unto a great lion, and he walks about promulgating religion as his chief means of bringing about the destruction of men. it is therefore to the best interest of the people that they be warned about the Devil and about his deceptive doctrines and methods, which lead them into darkness and destruction. Because a person is a Catholic, Protestant or Jew is no reason whatsoever, and is certainly no excuse, why that person should be hated. Jehovah’s witnesses, acting at the command of the Lord, are carrying these truths to Catholics, Protestants, Jews, and all others who will hear, that they may know that Jehovah is the only true God, the only means of life, and that Christ Jesus is his great Vindicator and administrator of life to the people.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> Jehovah God knew from the beginning all things that would come to pass, and he caused many such things to be foretold and set down in the Bible, and this for the specific aid, comfort and hope of the persons of good will, particularly those who might be on earth at the end of the world, where we now are. God put his spirit upon faithful men of old called “prophets”, and caused them to write down such prophecy; which prophecies are now in course of fulfillment: “Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the holy [spirit].” (2 Pet. 1:20,21) Said one of these prophets of Jehovah: “The spirit of the Lord spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.” (2 Sam. 23:2) The spirit of God directed those faithful men of old as to what they should write, and for that reason they then wrote things concerning which they had no understanding. They wrote, in cryptic or hidden phrase (1 Pet. 1:10-12), the things about which those faithful prophets did not understand. The things concerning which they wrote at God’s command must be understood at some time, and God discloses in his Word that it is his will that these prophecies shall be understood after the coming of the Lord to his temple and the setting up of the antitypical “tabernacle of David”, as aforementioned. (1 Cor. 10:11; Rom. 15:4) God himself brings to pass certain facts in fulfillment of his prophecies, and by these and his spirit he enables those who love him, and who seek to know the truth, to obtain an understanding and appreciation of such prophecies. As his prophecies are made understandable by his grace the Lord uses the Watch Tower publications to make known the same. Such publications do not attempt to express the opinion of any man, but call attention to the prophecies and to the physical facts which God has brought to pass, and thus enable each one who is devoted to God to see and understand the meaning thereof. Those who now love God bear witness to the fact that since the year 1918 God has unfolded many of his prophecies which before could not be understood because not his due time.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JOEL’S PROPHECY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">” The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> now undertakes the publication concerning the prophecy known in the Bible as Joel’s prophecy, citing the facts along with the prophecy that each one may see that we are in the day of the fulfillment thereof. Jerusalem was the capital city of the Jews, or Israelites. It was the place where God had put his name. The Israelites were the typical people of God. They had fallen away from their covenant and indulged in religious practices in violation of God’s specific commandment to them. The Devil had turned the scribes and Pharisees, particularly, into his fold and used them there, and thus those men, as the clergy amongst the Jews, became the chief instruments of Satan to ensnare the Israelites, or Jews. That nation, otherwise called &quot;Jerusalem”, was a type of “Christendom”. Those nations now on the earth that claim to be Christian and that practice what they call the “Christian religion” constitute “Christendom”, which is the antitype of the Jews under their religious leaders. The prophecy of Joel had a miniature fulfillment upon Jerusalem, and its real or complete and final fulfillment is upon “Christendom”. God made the specific covenant with the nation of Israel known as “the law covenant”. The Jews solemnly promised that they would obey all the terms of that covenant, and no doubt the Jews of that early time were sincere in their desire to carry out the terms of the covenant. As time passed on the Jews yielded to the hypocritical practices of religion and fell away from God and became the instruments of the Devil. In the days of the apostles of Jesus Christ groups of sincere persons were formed into companies and were properly called “Christians”, because they followed Christ Jesus and put forth their best endeavors to obey God’s commandment to walk in the way of Christ Jesus, their Lord and Leader. Following the days of the apostles various nations of earth adopted what they called “the Christian religion”, claiming to be Christians, and hence such people or nations voluntarily entered into an implied covenant to obey the commandment of God and to follow in the footsteps of Jesus Christ. Without a doubt those professed Christians of early days were sincerely and diligently endeavoring to fulfill their covenant with God. As time progressed all of those so-called “Christian nations” fell under the seductive influence of religion and since have practiced a religion which they have named “the Christian religion”. In fact, there is no such thing as “Christian religion”, for the reason that Christianity and religion are diametrically opposed one to the other. The so-called “Christian religion” has been carried on contrary to the will of God and in defamation of his name. Hence the willing and intelligent practitioners of religion are hypocrites, and a great crop of hypocrites has been brought forth, and throughout the lands called “Christendom” hypocrisy now is holding sway. Not one nation amongst so-called “Christendom” has any interest whatsoever in God’s kingdom under Christ Jesus, but, on the contrary, opposes the same.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> God sent his prophets to give warning to Jerusalem that their practice of religion was an abomination in his sight, and he caused them to be informed of his purpose to punish them unless they turned away quickly from religion. Among the prophets whom God used to give such warning was Joel. The prophecy by Joel was “written aforetime” for the specific benefit of those who are today on the earth and who love God, and the final and complete fulfillment of that prophecy takes place after the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple. The religious practitioners amongst the Jew’s charged God’s prophets with carrying on a campaign of hate, and they persecuted the messengers of the Lord for that reason. Likewise today the faithful men and women who at the command of the Lord go about “Christendom” giving testimony to the people of and concerning the fulfillment of the prophecies are charged with carrying on a campaign of hate. The religionists hated Jesus and persecuted him, and he told his followers plainly that they w’ould be hated for the same reason.—John 15:19-22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>17</sup> The prophecy of Joel is of peculiar interest to the remnant of God’s anointed people and also to his “other sheep”, the Jonadabs, at the present time, and, without a doubt, was written and is now made understandable to such, “for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope”. (Rom. 15:4) Joel’s prophecy emphasizes particularly the following things:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> God’s work, designated in the Scriptures as his “strange work”, he is causing to be done in “Christendom” and which must be completed prior to Armageddon as a witness and a warning to “Christendom”; that God uses in doing this work the people ‘taken out for his name’, together with their companions, and by these he gives warning specifically to all who have looked for individual salvation and honor, and who have been indifferent to the honor and vindication of Jehovah’s name. The prophecy exposes to view the “evil servant” class and “the man of sin”, “the son of perdition.” The prophecy foretells what will be the effect of God’s “strange work” upon “Christendom”. It shows the formation of a totalitarian state, and the full cooperation of the practitioners of the so-called “Christian religion” with the dictators of the world in opposition to God’s kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>19</sup> The prophecy discloses the difficulty into which true Christians fell, and discloses the recovery of the faithful ones from such difficulty, and the outpouring of God’s spirit upon all flesh.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> The prophecy shows the united effort of the religionists, politicians and commercial rulers to destroy those who faithfully serve Jehovah God. Instead of such conspiracy and united efforts on the part of the enemy to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses deterring them from their work, the prophecy shows that the faithful ones are not dismayed because thereof, but that the anointed remnant and their companions boldly and joyfully march onward, doing the work as commanded by Jehovah God and his King. Furthermore it shows Jehovah inviting all of the Devil’s forces to come on and fight, and that the result is and shall be to the glory of Jehovah and to the vindication of his name. The prophecy shows the complete destruction of religion and the triumph of God’s kingdom of righteousness. These truths, now revealed and when understood by those devoted to the Lord, of necessity bring joy and hope to them.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> Manifestly it is God’s due time to reveal to his people an understanding of the prophecy of Joel, and it is deemed proper and pleasing to the Lord to examine the same here in detail. Read the Bible texts carefully, together with other appropriate texts cited, as the study in this prophecy progresses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ARMIES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">** The opening words of the prophecy show that it was written according to the commandment of Jehovah God: “The word of the Lord that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel.” (Joel 1:1) The name Joel means &quot;Jehovah [is his] God”. Since individuals are of no importance and the Word of God is not written to exalt individuals, the personal history of Joel is not recorded. He was an instrument in the hand of God, and to God alone belong and go all credit and honor. In the consideration of a prophecy or prophetic picture it is not necessary or even proper to look upon the prophetic writer or the players and what they do, as acts of wonderment. We should always look to God and upon the work that he does, both in the prophecy and in the fulfillment, as that which is wonderful, and then we shall see and appreciate the prophecy. It is God and his works that are wonderful; and truly he works in a marvelous way in the performance of his will. God used animate and inanimate creatures to make prophetic pictures, and sometimes the one used was devoted to God, and sometimes not, thus showing that the individual is of no importance but God is of all importance. The name of the prophet or players and the meaning thereof are important, because disclosing the fact that God uses such to do and to perform his work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">*• Joel was &quot;the son of Pethuel”, which name means &quot;enlarged of God”. The name appropriately calls attention to the things that come to pass in connection with the fulfillment of the prophecy. Joel, being a witness of Jehovah, represented the faithful remnant of the anointed, who are made and constituted the witnesses of Jehovah. The father of such witnesses is Jehovah God, because they are his children ; and the meaning of the name of Joel’s father would therefore call attention to the fact, (1) that the remnant were loosed or released from the bondage of Satan’s organization (Isa. 14:17; Isa. 52:2; Ezek. 37:12,13; Ps. 116:16; Ps. 105:20); and (2) that the mouth of such was enlarged or opened by the Lord that they might deliver the kingdom message (Ps. 51:15; Ps. 78:2; Ezek. 3: 27; Ezek. 24:27; Ezek. 33:22); and (3) that their ears were made to hear and to obey Jehovah’s commandments in delivering his message. (Isa. 50:5; Isa. 35:5) The names both of Joel and of his father point to the fact that the fulfillment of the prophecy written by Joel is completed after the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple of Jehovah God in A.D. 1918 and within &quot;the day of Jehovah”.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>44</sup> The word of the Lord which came to Joel was an emphatic command which Joel must obey, and he must deliver the message as commanded. Likewise the ‘people taken out for his name’ receive their commission from Jehovah God, and they must obey his commandments and carry out the same by delivering God’s message to all to whom he sends them: &quot;Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?” (Joel 1:2) It appears that the &quot;old men” mentioned in this last-quoted verse refers to those who rest upon their own laurels, esteeming their wisdom far superior to that of others, and who pride themselves upon what they have gained in the past, and who fail to give honor to Jehovah God. Such, as indicated by the Scriptures, are those who become self-appointed &quot;leaders of the people”, and who teach the doctrines of men, and who therefore lead the people into error. Such are ‘the prophets that teach lies’; ‘the leaders of the people cause them to err.’ (Isa. 9:15,16) &quot;Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet: but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.” —Ezek. 7:26.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>45</sup> The &quot;old men” and the &quot;inhabitants of the land” who follow their lead do not ask that the message be brought to them, but it is sent to them and they are commanded to hear because it is &quot;the word of the Lord”. The message is addressed to those who have made a covenant to do the will of God but who have become unfaithful and broken that covenant. Today the practitioners of religion which is called &quot;the Christian religion” are in an implied covenant to obey God, but they do not perform their part of the covenant. They are not the servants of God, but, on the contrary, they bring reproach upon Jehovah’s name. God will not permit them to have any excuse for their course of action, but sends them his word and demands that they give heed to the warning. Thus the Lord commands his witnesses to carry his message to “Christendom” at the present time, and even to those who do not ask for it or even want it. Jehovah’s witnesses go to the people, and particularly within the hearing of the leaders, and deliver to them the message of Jehovah. It is not the message of hate, nor is it delivered because of hate, but it is God’s message of fair warning and delivered at his command, notifying all of his purpose to vindicate his name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">“When Jehovah’s witnesses approach such peo-</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">pie </span><span class="font5">the religionists say: “Strange that Christians should be engaged in such a work of warning the clergy and leaders of ‘Christendom’!” That is the way it appears to them. It is indeed a “strange work”, because it is God’s “strange work”, for the reason that it is God’s time to have the warning given to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">‘dreamers’. To them the Lord says: “Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?” The day of calamity upon religion and religious practitioners is at hand. An announcement thereof must be made. Has there before been the like upon earth in the days of “Christendom”? Prior to 1918, when the Lord appeared at his temple, and including the days of the so-called “fathers of the church”, and particularly in the days of the “Elijah period” of the church, when the Lord did the work of preparing the way before Jehovah, was there ever anything like this? Because the work following that time, and which is done at the command of the Almighty God, has never had an equal in the memory of man, it makes that work a “strange work” in the eyes of so-called “Christian religionists”. It is in fact God’s “strange work” and gives notice of the near approach of “his act, his strange act”. The clergy and the “evil servant” class, and those of the “elective elder” spirit, regard it very strange that men and women who claim to be Christian should be indulging in the practice of warning others who also claim to be Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">*<sup>T</sup> Because this work done in giving warning to “Christendom” is so unusual God commands as follows : “Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation.” (Joel 1:3) It is now so strange to the religionists that it is something to be talked about. There will never be the like of it on earth again, because it is the final warning. Some of the inhabitants of the land hear and give heed to the warning and take their place in the Jonathan or Jonadab class, which constitutes the Lord’s “other sheep” and who will form the “great multitude”, but the number thereof is small compared with the practitioners of religion.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>38</sup> Then the Lord gives warning through the prophet of a coming devastation that shall fall upon Jerusalem and later upon antitypical Jerusalem, to wit, “Christendom,” and which will completely denude the land: “That which the palmerworm hath left, hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left, hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left, hath the caterpillar eaten.” —Joel 1:4-.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">” The language employed indicates a series of pests that come, but in the fulfillment of the proph</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ecy the </span><span class="font5">reference is not to literal pests that have been eating the farmers’ crops since 1918, any more than the fulfillment of the prophecy now applies to the literal city of Jerusalem. The pests referred to in this fourth verse Jehovah calls “my great army” (Joel 2:25), and which great army devastates the land.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> According to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font5"> and a footnote of the text the record is: ‘The creeping locusts (devourers not yet winged); swarming locusts (the kind appearing in large swarms).’ The plague mentioned in the text is fourfold and is the same as pictured in Revelation 9:1-12, in which Jehovah foretells that he will send his witnesses, who are likened unto locusts sent as a plague, upon “Christendom”. The plague’s being fourfold shows that it brings about a complete destruction of the food, or fodder rather, which “Christendom” and her leaders provide for the feeding of the people. Today the truth is a plague which exposes the fodder provided by “Christendom” as food for the people, as being all lies and without any life-giving or life-sustaining value. God’s message, delivered by his messengers, exposes all religion as being of the Devil and therefore that which leads the people into the Devil’s snare and ultimately into destruction. The plague comes as one pest following another and leaves nothing of “Christendom’s” fodder or pastures untouched. The message of truth exposes religion as fraudulent and death-dealing and appears to be the fourth and last plague of pests, and after which there is nothing that remains to be devoured. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book of Jehovah’s witnesses</span><span class="font5"> for the year 1937 sets forth some important information concerning the expose of religion. That this message is not a message of man and is not given because of hate or ill will, but is given strictly in obedience to the commandment of Almighty God, is shown from what follows, to wit:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>31</sup> The text discloses the ones aroused as being sleepers and drinkers, who have become maudlin drunk: “Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.” (Joel 1:5) God calls upon them to awake; but to awake to what? To the fact that disaster is about to overwhelm them and that such disaster is the expression of God’s wrath against those who have disregarded and violated their implied covenant to obey him. “Christendom,” meaning the religious practitioners in particular, has been warned by Jehovah God and has given no heed to such warning. What Jehovah here says through his prophet applies to “Christendom” with stronger emphasis than to the people of Jerusalem in the type, because the people of “Christendom” have professed to be the children of God and servants of the Most High and yet, with all the advantages and opportunities they have had in the past, they have become the past masters in hypocrisy. What God said to the Israelites through Moses now applies with stronger force to the professed practitioners who are religionists, to wit: “But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee.” “And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass [scorching hot, with no rain], and the earth that is under thee shall be iron [burned to a crisp and hard and dry]. The Lord shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust [the condition that results in 'Christendom’ after God’s army, the antitypical locusts, have eaten up everything]; from heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed.” “The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart.”—Deut. 28:15,23,24, 28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>32</sup> The drunkards, hearing the command of the Lord, wake up in a measure, but do they awake with joy? No; on the contrary, the Lord tells them: “Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl.” “Christendom’s” leaders have for long been under the influence of Satan’s wine made from “the vine of the earth” and are in a drunken stupor. Instead of repenting and weeping when first warned and thus forestalling what is about to come upon them, they first wake up when the calamity is just upon them. They heard the message during the “Elijah period” of the church’s work, but scorned it, and now, when Armageddon is very near, they get a stronger jolt. The political spellbinders, who have made a studied effort to deceive the people, and have done so; the religion mongers, who have hypocritically claimed to represent God and his King, but who have represented the Devil and have led the people into the Devil’s snare; and the money-changers, who have used both politics and religion to accomplish their ultraselfish deeds, have all drunk deep the wine of Babylon, fermented for them by Satan, and have all become drunk, and they have fallen into a stupor, forgetting God, and have utterly ignored their obligation to their fellow creatures. Being ultraselfish, and their drinking having intensified their selfishness, they look only to self-interest, and never seek to do good to their fellow creatures, and always dishonor the name of Almighty God. The three elements named constitute the official elements of the inhabitants of the earth, and are used by Satan to control the people of the earth. They imbibe Satan’s false and wicked policies and carry them out. They drink much from Satan’s wine and receive the effervescent effect from it and become reckless and wanton, and live in selfish pleasure and self-gratification. Satan leads them into his trap by means of religion, and they have been easily led after having imbibed the cup which Satan has prepared for them. Concerning this Jehovah by another of his prophets says: “But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment. For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place clean.” (Isa. 28:7,8) And thus God depicts the miserable condition of “Christendom”, which claims to represent the Almighty on earth. The day of reckoning comes, and the Lord, by his inspired servant, says to that crowd: “Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth; and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.”—Jas. 5:1-5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>33</sup> In all of the drunken revelry and debauchery amongst the nations of earth today religion takes the lead. Because the leaders of religion have hypocritically claimed to be the servants of God and have, contrary to God’s Word, mixed with and become a part of Satan’s world, the religious element of the state organization is likened unto an adulterous woman. Outwardly they may be entirely chaste, so far as the flesh is concerned, and uttering soft and kind words, while inwardly they are having illicit relationship with the admitted elements of Satan’s organization, which is called the “present evil world”. Therefore, says the Word of God concerning them: “Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God.” (Jas. 4:4) The Lord uses strong and emphatic language to make known the despicable condition of the religious systems, likening the same unto a blear-eyed harlot. God does not mince words, but he makes them so emphatic that no one has an excuse for not understanding them, and when these words are repeated in the presence or hearing of religionists they go stark mad and desire to destroy the ones who bring the message to their attention. Then the Lord addresses himself to those who hear and obey his voice, and says: &quot;Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters [peoples]: with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.” “And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.” —Rev. 17:1, 2,5.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>34</sup>Note this according to the Scriptures: that the three elements above mentioned (Joel 1:2,5) that dominate the earth are drunken “because of the new wine”. New wine intoxicates quickly, and the Devil saw to it that plenty of new wine from his vineyard made from the vine of the earth was fermented and brought forth for “Christendom” since 1918, when he was cast out of heaven and down to the earth. (Rev. 12:1-12) New wine is seductive and causes the creature to glorify himself and to reproach Jehovah God. Satan’s “new wine” first appeared under the guise of the “League of Nations”, which is a substitute for God’s kingdom and is hailed by the religionists as such. It is announced as the means for ruling and establishing the earth. The ruling element once made drunken on this “wine” were easily led further into the snare of the Devil by giving the greatest importance to the state and magnifying the state or worldly government above Jehovah God. The drinkers, well tanked up on the Devil’s wine, then have united on what is known as the “totalitarian government”, or rule by arbitrary dictators. Furthering his deceptive schemes to overreach the people where democracies are supposed to exist, the Devil brings forth other idolatrous schemes setting the state above God, and brings into operation compulsory flag-saluting, oaths of allegiance to be taken by those who are native citizens of the state, bestowing honor upon men, and particularly magnifying politics and religion and religious leaders. With all of the disturbance and turmoil in the earth the political leaders loudly proclaim: “We must have more religion as a cure for the ills of the nations of the earth.” Not that we must have a return to God and his kingdom, but religion is what they insist upon, which is wholly an invention of the Devil. Cruelly and subtly the totalitarian or dictator schemes move forward, and now the dictators have become bold and arrogant and have formed a block of nations, including Germany, Italy, Japan and other states, and on top of which block or combine the so-called “spiritual” Roman Catholic Hierarchy sits in great state and struts her stuff, administering supposed doses of soothing remedy in a studied effort to make Satan’s rule or wine of this world appear a sweet wine. This is only a meager description of the presentday condition, and it is well known, by all who think, that the conditions are far worse than here described. The world today is in such a condition that human words cannot properly describe the same. In the land called “Christendom” God’s holy name is defamed and his kingdom opposed, and the three ruling elements above mentioned have brought themselves into their present condition by an overindulgence of Satan’s new wine.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>55</sup> Following the World War, and after the religious leaders walked straightway into the political camp, the three elements aforementioned began to function together more completely and at that time there was much hilarity amongst them. The religionists then regarded that as the time ripe for them to join up with their allies, the political and commercial giants, and rule the earth in the place and stead of God’s kingdom under Christ Jesus. They became noisy and loud, and their merriment was due to the exhilaration of the new wine of Babylon produced by Satan for them. For centuries religionists have endeavored, as they have frequently stated, to bring the world into the church, but in modern times the religious organization called “the Christian religion” and “church” have walked right into the political, worldly camp, and have all gotten beastly drunk on the new wine of the “vine of the earth”. Their boisterous hilarity was of short duration. And why? The Lord, by his prophet, answers the question: “For it is cut off from [their] mouth.” Instead of hilarity they begin to howl, as God has stated in this prophecy. What interrupted the felicitations of the would-be rulers of the earth ? The answer is, Jehovah’s “strange work”. But how? Jehovah has sent forth his people, whom he has taken out of the nations as a people for his name, and these at Jehovah’s command proclaim the name of Jehovah and his King and kingdom. That message of truth makes known the name and Word of Jehovah God, exposes the aforementioned combine of religionists and their religion as a delusion and a scheme of the Devil formed to deceive and destroy the peoples of the earth. The heavenly kingdom message shows that the religious combine, instead of having God’s approval, constitutes an abomination in his sight, and therefore Jehovah God sounds the doom of religion and religious rulers and discloses that such shall be completely wiped out at Armageddon. Following the World War Jehovah God provided and caused his servants to use the radio, sound machines, the printing press, and other means, to carry his message amongst the people and herald his name and that of his King and kingdom to the people, and this has greatly annoyed the drinkers and interrupts their felicitations. Therefore their joy is cut off, as the Lord says, from their mouths, by the plagues which Jehovah sends upon them, and it is Jehovah’s antitypical locusts that carry the plague message. Having rejected Christ, the King of the world, the religionists and allies have no access to the joy of the Lord, and therefore they do not ‘drink the fruit of the vine new with Christ Jesus in the kingdom’. Only his faithful servants do that. (Matt. 26: 29) Thus those who love the Lord, his appearing and his kingdom can partake of the Lord’s wine new with real joy with Christ Jesus, who has gathered them into the temple.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>38</sup> Satan’s visible ruling element in the earth, that is, the state organization, is referred to in the Scriptures under the symbol of a “beast”, the earth being </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">symbol of the visible part of Satan’s world, including the people who support it. (2 Cor. 4: 4) When Christ Jesus the King appeared at the temple of God Satan brought forth his substitute for the kingdom, and the time had then arrived for God to begin the expression of his wrath against the abominable thing of Satan. “And I heard a great -voice out of the temple [of God, there present representatively by Christ Jesus] saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth. And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast [Satan’s state organization], and upon them which worshipped his image [of tie beast, the combination of state powers to rule].”—Rev. 16:1,2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>37</sup> The message of God proclaimed according to his commandment by his faithful witnesses on the earth then greatly disturbed the politicians or religionists and allies who had agreed to rule the earth, but then it was that the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses began in earnest: “And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain, and blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.” (Rev. 16:10,11) The physical facts that came to pass from and after 1926 show the fulfillment of this prophecy uttered in Revelation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>88</sup> Let those who love Jehovah and his kingdom take note of the beginning of the progress of Jehovah’s “strange work” and, appreciating the same, let them rejoice and give praise to Jehovah for permitting his servants to have a part in that work. To these faithful ones the Lord now speaks through his prophet, to wit: “For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion.” (Joel 1:6) The nation described in this text as a “nation . . . come up” is God’s holy nation, or people for his<sup>1</sup> name taken out of the world for his name’s sake (1 Pet. 2:9,10; Acts 15:14), and such nation is represented on earth by the remnant of God’s anointed people. Associated with the remnant is a company without number, made up of those who are of good will toward God and who constitute the Lord’s “other sheep” and whose hearts are right, and they join with God’s holy nation, and they all work together in harmony. The rendering of this part of the text (Joel 1:6) according to Strong’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Concordance</span><span class="font5"> is: “Figuratively, in the sense of a massing; a flight (as of locusts).” Note that in Joel 1:4 God sends against “Christendom” the locusts to devour and devastate the products of the land. The locusts work together, just as God’s holy nation moves forward in a harmonious action. They have no earthly king, but are led by the Lord, the invisible King: “The locusts have no [earthly] king, yet go they forth all of them by bands </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[(margin)</span><span class="font5"> gathered together].”—Prov. 30: 27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">30 The “<sub>na</sub>tio<sub>n</sub>” h<sub>ere</sub> symbolized by locusts “come up upon my land”, saith the Lord, that is, upon unfaithful Judah in the miniature fulfillment, and now, in the complete fulfillment, upon “Christendom”, which nations claim to be the antitypical Judah, or those who praise and serve God, but do not and hence are hypocrites. The religionists claim that “Christendom” is the land of God. They practice what they call “the Christian religion”, but which is in fact a defamation of God’s name. It is that “land” which Jehovah causes his witnesses, pictured by locusts, to invade with the message of wrath against hypocrisy, and by proclaiming God’s message of truth the hypocrites are stung and their pastures are devoured.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>40</sup> It is important to here note that the “nation” that comes upon the land to devour does not engage in human slaughter or physical violence to any creatures or animals. That nation, likened unto locusts, does not resort to the use of the sword or any other instrument of violence. The damage is done, as stated in the prophecy, to the vegetation that grows upon the land and upon which the people feed. The prophecy in its miniature fulfillment in Joel’s day inflicted great harm upon the Israelites, and this was by a mass of living, moving creatures that came from outside of Palestine and therefore foreign to that land. Even so in like manner in the real fulfillment today upon “Christendom”, a swarm of moving, living creatures conies upon “Christendom”, does not engage in physical violence, but this army does devour the food or fodder which “Christendom” has prepared and invited the people to eat and upon which the people have tried to feed and have starved. This is proof conclusive that it is the message of God’s Word, proclaimed in the hearing of the people, including the ruling element, that devours that which “Christendom” produces in the way of so-called “spiritual” food. Jehovah’s witnesses and companions, who carry the message, are not engaged in a work of hate, any more than it can be said that the locusts ate up the vegetation of the fields because of hate. Jehovah’s witnesses proclaim the message of truth because God has commanded that they must do so. Therefore the same is an expression of God’s wrath against hypocrisy by which the people are deceived and God’s name defamed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>41</sup> Further describing the Lord’s invading army, the record (Joel 1:6) is, the nation is “strong [bold </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)],</span><span class="font5"> and without number”. They are strong and bold because they are sent forth in the strength and power of the Lord and are backed up by everlasting and unlimited power. (2 Chron. 16:9; Deut. 33:27) They are “without number”, it being true of them as it was said of the seed of Abraham. (Gen. 15:5) The number, as compared to the mass of humanity, is small; yet by their zeal and their organized, harmonious action Jehovah’s witnesses and companions are likened today by “Christendom” to a host “without number”. “Whose teeth are the teeth of a lion”; because they are like their Head and Lord, Christ Jesus, who is “the Lion of the tribe of Juda” and whom the remnant follow in obedience to his command. “And he [that is, Christ Jesus, the great Lion] hath the cheek [(R.F.) jaw] teeth of a great lion.” Christ Jesus knows no defeat, and he tears to pieces all hypocrisy that brings reproach upon the name of Jehovah, and his true followers have a part in this work. The religious combine now in the saddle as a totalitarian, arbitrary rule moves forward. Even in the land called “democracy” hypocrisy is practiced among many of the ruling elements who speak loud against dictators, while at the same time forging forward with dictatorial methods to regiment and control the people and take away all their liberties. The clergy and other religious leaders advocate and aid in the enactment of laws compelling the saluting of flags and laws which place the state above Almighty God and his King. Never in the history of man has there been so much hypocrisy practiced as now, and in the practice of hypocrisy religion takes the lead and the political spellbinders howl, “We must have more religion.” Religious bodies make great pretense of advocating the liberties of the people, particularly freedom of speech, freedom of press, and freedom of worship, but at the same time they are active in making laws that take away from the people all such liberties. Exactly as God foretold by his prophet, they 'frame mischief by law’ and condemn those who love and serve righteousness. (Ps. 94:20,21) The clergy today appear before legislative bodies and advocate the enactment of such laws depriving the people of the liberty of speech and worship. The religious leaders and their allies attempt the destruction of those who serve God, even as Jehovah foretold that such hypocrites with their mouth destroy their neighbors; and the hypocrites do so because God’s message exposes them to the view of all honest people. For the comfort and hope of his people now on the earth Jehovah long ago foretold his present-day means of carrying on his “strange work” and what part his faithful people now on earth might have in that work. As progress is made in the study and understanding of this prophecy of Joel those of good will toward God will rejoice, and hence we commend to all of such the careful study of what follows.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark9"></a>IS DEATH AN</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">S</span><span class="font3">CIENTISTS and religionists who claim to be wise tell the people that “great men” living on the earth for a season accomplish much and then at death pass on to the next world, there to accomplish much more. Some have referred to the experience of death as the beginning of “the great adventure” into the unknown beyond. There is but one class of persons that can even by faith look with hope for a better place beyond this world, and that class of people is made up of those who are fully devoted to God as followers of Christ Jesus. No man can have the hope of passing at death into a better condition who has not believed upon God and upon Christ and his kingdom and has not devoted himself entirely to the Lord, and even that passing into a better condition can only take place beginning at a certain definite point of time, which time is marked by a prominent event in the onward march of God’s affairs.—See Revelation 14:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To support the popular religious teaching that the dead are conscious in heaven, or in purgatory, or in hell, the clergy must find that man has an immortal soul. “Immortality” means the quality or state of being deathless, unable</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark11"></a>ADVENTURE?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">to die or perish. It is easy to see that no creature could be for ever in conscious hell torment or in heaven or in purgatory if that creature could be killed, destroyed. Therefore the master mind behind such false doctrines said: ‘We must teach that man has an immortal soul.’ If, however, the Scripture proof is that man is a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mortal</span><span class="font3"> soul, a soul subject to death, then the purgatory and torment theories must be completely false.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When God made the first man and placed him in the garden of Eden God said to man: 'In the day that you sin you shall surely die.’ (See Genesis 2:16,17.) That was the plain statement of God’s law. Did God mean that only the body should die? Ezekiel 18:4, 20 answers: “The soul that sinneth, it shall die.” Psalm 89:48: “What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul [not merely his body] from the hand of the grave ?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In its “Ask and Learn” column, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic TelegraphRegister,</span><span class="font3"> of Cincinnati, Ohio, as of March 31, 1939, quote, one of its inquirers and then answers, as follows: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Tht Bible says that, if a soul sins, it shall die. Please explain. </span><span class="font3">[Answer] The soul’s death through sin is a figure of speech which is used to indicate that the soul is turned away from its true end, God, by mortal sin. Grace, which is often spoken of as the life of the soul, is driven out of the soul by serious sin. But, strictly speaking, the soul cannot die since it is a spiritual substance which cannot corrupt.” Not only is this Catholic answer senseless, meaningless, but not a single scripture is cited or quoted in support of the answer. If the soul’s death means it is “turned away from its true end, God”, then what of Jesus, concerning whom the inspired prophecy (Isa. 53:12) says: “He hath delivered his soul unto death, and was reputed with the wicked: and he hath borne the sins of many, and hath prayed for the transgressors”? (Catholic Bible) Also Jesus’ own words in the garden of Gethsemane: “Then he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death.” (Matt. 26:38, Catholic Bible) Did Jesus’ soul die because “grace • . . is driven out of the soul by serious sin” of Jesus? Jesus did not say his “soul cannot die since it is a spiritual substance which cannot corrupt”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Eden Jehovah told Adam the eating of a certain fruit would result in his death. Satan the Devil desired to alienate man from God and have the worship of man for himself. Fraudulently and using the serpent as his medium, the Devil approached Eve and said to her: You can eat of that food; and if you do eat it, you will be as wise as God himself. You surely shall not die.’ Thus he induced Eve to disobey God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The only support for the theory of immortality of all souls is what the Devil here said. God stated: “Thou shalt surely die.” The Devil stated: “Ye shall not surely die.” Whom will you believe, God or the Devil? The religionists have accepted the Devil’s statement and rejected God’s; therefore their teaching is false. The Devil was the father of lies, and this lie was his first. To the religious clergy of his time Jesus said: “Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.”—John 8: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Devil himself is not immortal, because the Scriptures show that Jehovah God by Christ Jesus will destroy the Devil in due time. (Read Hebrews 2:14; Ezekiel 28:13-19.) Properly, then, we might put up to the clergy this question: If hell is a place of eternal torment, and if the Devil is the chief fireman there, who is going to keep up the fire when the Devil is destroyed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Rather than already possessing immortality inherently, a Christian is admonished to “seek” immortality, incorruptibility. (See  Romans 2:7.) A man does not seek that which he already possesses. God alone possesses the quality of immortality, as written at 1 Timothy 6:16: “Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Jesus was on the earth he was not immortal, otherwise he could not have died on the tree; but God gave him immortality at his resurrection from the dead. (John 5:26; Rev. 1:18) The faithful overcoming Christians, of the <sup>&lt;f</sup>body of Christ”, are promised immortality as a glorious reward at the resurrection; as it is written: “This mortal must put on immortality.” (1 Cor. 15: 53, 54) It would be inconsistent for the Lord to have put that into his Word if man were already immortal. Now, these scriptures show that man </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font3"> a soul; that he is subject to death; that he is therefore not immortal; and these things being true, it must follow that a man, when he dies, could not go to heaven immediately, or go to a purgatory or to eternal torment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">People in sorrow like to believe that their loved ones have gone to a place of rest and peace, and so the clergy religionists have told the people that all the good members of their church go to heaven when they die. They have found no support for this in the Scriptures. Heaven is the habitation of Jehovah. No man ever has seen Jehovah or ever can see him. “For there shall no man see me [Jehovah], and live.” (Exodus 33:20; also 1 Timothy 6:16) Anyone who goes to heaven must be changed from human to spirit at his resurrection, thus to be like the glorified Christ Jesus.—1 John 3:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the time Jesus was on earth more than four thousand years had elapsed since death entered the human race. Great numbers had died, and among them men whom God approved. A long list of these approved ones is given in the eleventh chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews. Not one there mentioned went to heaven. Concerning all the approved ones that had died up to the time Jesus was on earth he said: “No man hath ascended up to heaven.”— John 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Among such ones who were faithful to God was David, who was anointed to be king in Jerusalem. It is written concerning David that he was a man after God’s own heart. (1 Sam. 13:14; Acts 13: 22) David was used to foreshadow The Christ. The name David means “beloved”. At the dictation of Jehovah he was the writer of many of the Psalms. Surely if any men were to be taken to heaven at death David would be among them. But it is plainly written concerning him: “David is not ascended into the heavens.” That is what the apostle Peter stated under inspiration of the holy spirit, on the day of Pentecost, ten days after Jesus had ascended from earth to heaven. (Acts 2:34) John the Baptist was a good man, and received the approval of God, and was the one selected to announce the coming of the Savior of the world. He was beheaded shortly after Jesus began his ministry. He died because of his faithfulness to God. Yet Jesus declared that John the Baptist would never be of the heavenly kingdom class, for though none of earth might be greater than John the Baptist, yet the least in the kingdom of heaven would be greater than John. (Matt. 11:11) Psalm 45:16 shows that John is to be one of those whom Christ Jesus, “the Everlasting Father”, will “make princes in all the earth” under the heavenly kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Heaven is promised as a special reward to those who devote themselves to Jehovah God and are accepted in sacrifice with Christ Jesus and are begotten as spiritual children of God and who then prove faithful unto God even unto death. Concerning such it is written: “God . . . hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible, and undcfiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time.” (1 Pet. 1:3-5) It is wholly unreasonable, and inconsistent with Jehovah’s revealed purpose, that he would provide heaven for so-called &quot;good people” in general, whereas Jehovah specifically states that it is only for those who, after the giving of Christ’s ransom sacrifice, are faithful unto death with him.—Rev. 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No creature could be enjoying bliss in heaven, or be undergoing suffering in purgatory or torture in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> hell of fire and brimstone, or any other “adventure” after death, unless that creature were conscious at the time. Some clergymen try to qualify the statement as to bodily torment in hell by saying that the wicked are merely undergoing ‘mental torment’ because of the memory of their wickedness. Neither could this be true, unless the creature were conscious at the time and able to remember what had taken place. If now the Scripture proof establishes the fact that when one dies he has no knowledge nor wisdom; that he has no memory; that he cannot work and cannot think; and that he is in a condition of silence, such absolutely disproves the clergyman’s theory that the dead are undergoing any kind of suffering or any kind of joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God is true, and his written Word is true. Men are not true, nor is their word true, except when in harmony with God’s Word. (Note Romans 3:4.) Upon the question at issue the following quotations from the Word of God are submitted, with absolute confidence of establishing what is stated above:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ecclesiastes 9:5, 6,10: “For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward, for the memory of them is forgotten. Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun. Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Psalm 6:4, 5: “Return, 0 Lord, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies’ sake. For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Psalm 49:14: “Like sheep they are laid in the grave [(Hebrew) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sheol;</span><span class="font3"> (Catholic Bible) in hell]; death shall feed on them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Psalm 115:17: “The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go down into silence”; that is, down into the grave, hence not merely “spiritually dead”, so called.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Genesis 2:7 shows man was made of the elements of the earth, and when he dies he returns to the dust.—Gen. 3:19; Ps. 104: 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ecclesiastes 3:19, 20: “For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dicth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity. All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to Genesis 2:7, the breath of life animated man and made his organs function. No longer do they function when he ceases to breathe. “His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.”—Ps. 146:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The clergy have attempted to apply these texts to the body only, and not to the soul. In this they are wrong; for it is the soul, animal or creature that ceases to exist at death, for the creature, animal or man </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font3"> a soul. (Ezek. 18:4) The human soul is not a “spiritual substance which cannot corrupt”, as says the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Telegraph-Register ; </span><span class="font3">no, the human soul is the fleshly creature man himself, breathing and exercising his senses and intelligence. (1 Cor. 15:45) Therefore, the dead being actually dead and not immortal and alive, the inspired apostle points to the resurrection as the sole hope for the dead, and writes: “Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead ? But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen. And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God • because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ; whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not. For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised; and if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye [Christians] are yet in your sins. Then they also which are fallen </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">asleep</span><span class="font3"> in Christ are </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">perished.” </span><span class="font3">If they were immortal those dying could not perish. On the other hand, being mortal, those that die would perish for ever were there no resurrection of the dead in due time, to wit, under God’s kingdom. Christ’s resurrection is a guarantee that the dead shall be awakened to a resurrection. (1 Cor. 15:12-18) There shall be a resurrection of the dead, of both the just and the unjust. (Acts 24:15) Of this Jehovah God has offered faith to men by reason of the fact that Jesus was raised from the dead.—Acts 17: 31, Rotherham’s translation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HOT PUBLIC MEETING IN SOUTH DAKOTA</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;Sunday a publisher called on a Catholic woman, who had an ‘ax to grind’ from the very time approached. Immediately her husband dashed out of the house like a maniac, with an American flag in his hands, which he dropped before, the publisher, and in a commanding voice shouted: ‘Will you salute this flag?’ The publisher refused. The super-patrioteer became enraged: ‘I am a Catholic and a Legionnaire. Get the------off my property!’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The publisher removed himself quietly. While he was being escorted off, the wife laughed and boasted: ‘We are going to give you plenty of trouble before the day is over.’ She let the cat out of the bag. We anticipated trouble, so we arranged for the town marshal to be present at the assembly. He consented. Next day (Monday) an ex-judge of Lyman County favorable to our work told me: ‘In the 32 years I have lived in Presho I have never heard Catholic church bells ring 2:30 in the afternoon. I knew something was cooking or up.’ Shortly after 3 p.m. the people began to assemble. The majority present were Catholics. Upon seeing the town marshal present, the Catholic Action group could do nothing, nor even dared. They sat through two-thirds of the lecture; one took the speech down in shorthand. The ‘heat’ got too intense: up got two Catholics, then six, and six more, and left. About fifteen minutes before end of lecture some husky lads came into an adjacent room of the auditorium, to disturb our meeting by having band practice, but upon seeing town marshal they retreated. Catholic Action group had in mind to interfere with personal speaker, but, finding out the portable transcription machine was to speak, they sought to destroy records. They failed in the whole setup. While witnessing in Presho business territory Monday I learned the following from the justice of the peace, an ex-county judge, and other sources: A Catholic committee, went to the State attorney and made an appeal that Jehovah’s witnesses be prevented from having their meeting Sunday. They suggested methods to him to interfere with the meeting. Himself a staunch Catholic, he made reply: ‘If the Catholic organization cannot give reply to Judge Rutherford’s exposé of the Roman Catholic organization, then they should go down. I’ll have nothing to do with interfering with the assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses. If you interfere you’ll just give them more publicity.’ Not getting any satisfaction from him, they approached the mayor of Presho and began to high-pressure him to interfere with our meeting. To this the mayor replied : ‘This is a free country. Nothing doing, men!’ Hence they tried to take the law into their own hands.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS, TRY THE PHONOGRAPH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Invited to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study, they came — just once. As they never came again, one day after field service I stopped in to see them. They (Mr. and Mrs.) were both out in the barn milking, so I went out and talked to them there. Well, they were going back to ‘church’, the preacher had called, etc., and I talked all I could, at least half an hour, but to no avail. I tried to get permission to put on a model study, but they would not consent. By then they were through milking, so I asked them if they would go to the house and listen to a record. They finally consented. I played ‘Miracles’ and then ‘Instruction’, and laid </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, Enemies</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font3"> on the table and folded up the phonograph, preparing to go. Said he: ‘Well, I guess we’ll take </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.'</span><span class="font3"> Then they agreed to a model study, which we put on the next week, and then left one of the old, large phonographs and records with them. Now they are coming to the study.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW ONE FAMILY SUPPORTER MAKES HER TIME</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I work every day from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. to support the family. After work, at 6 p.m. a group of ten to twelve young witnesses go every night but Friday with the company servant in a beach wagon, out into the field for two or three hours. During the campaign with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication </span><span class="font3">books, all on one short country road, four houses in succession, I placed 14 books, 3 booklets, with 3 back-calls. During this period with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> I called on these persons. I got two new subscriptions, and the other one is getting it as soon as I go. I follow them up with the series and the model study. I call on them as soon as I get a chance (for I’m pretty well tied up with back-calls every night). They show a very good spirit. I put in as much time as I can. The Lord’s work comes first in every occasion. With the Lord’s grace I’m shooting for the sixty-hour goal, even though I work 44 hours a week, almost every week. I think the Lord has really blessed us with the phonograph and back-calls.”</span></p>

I approached him with the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Liberty to Preach</span><span class="font3"> and asked him if he would like to go contrary to the Supreme Court’s decision. He replied this was his property; and that was that' I told the little girls to go right ahead, and I followed in also. He threatened to call the police; to which I consented. He left for a few minutes, to come back with another man, warning me of results if I did not leave. By that time the girls finished the camp, leaving several booklets with the people; the Lord’s doing again. At Volusia County [Fla.], knowing of the man’s attitude toward our work I had an elderly publisher go from the back end of the camp. At the same time I succeeded in getting permission from the owner of the home and lot (an elevated place) right across from this man’s camp to put on by electrical transcription the lecture ‘The Kingdom the Hope of the World’. This kind of upset the tourist-camp man, who came to ask if I had permission to broadcast; to which I answered ‘Yes’. He then left, only to send another, with sleeves rolled up. I ignored him. He stated he was calling the sheriff. Later comes the old lady mother of the man ‘raising sand’ and calling names. At that time the lady of the house took part: ‘This man has permission from me to put on this lecture. This is my land and home. I am enjoying the lecture.
