<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font15"><a name="bookmark25"></a>The Pope’s Responsibility for the New War</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font8">HE ease and frequency with which the “bleasings” of the “church” have been showered upon Mussolini, Hitler and Franco for their separate or joint campaigns in Ethiopia, Albania, the Saar, the Rhineland, Austria. Czechoslovakia, Memel, Danzig, and Spain, and fifteen centuries of European history, prove that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is the greatest mischiefmaker on the planet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">While it is not averse to ruling directly, as, for example, at the racket headquarters at Vatican City, yet it gets better results when it has its faithful sons in positions of responsibility as kings, dictators or presidents, where they can be played one against the other to suit the circumstances of the hour. Satan’s world ed. Now the world is again in tumult, as a result of the activities of the “Practical Catholic”, Adolf Hitler. This time the pope will succeed in establishing peace, but his price will be the control of the whole world. On this point, at page 292 of the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies,</span><span class="font8"> Judge Rutherford said:</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The prophecy of the Lord shows that modem Tyre, the Catholic organization, commits fornication with all the nations and gains her desire. When the Hierarchy has gained complete temporal power of f he earth, that will in her mind fully establish the conclusion that her desire has been fully accomplished, and then she will say “Peace and safety” (1 Thessalonians 5:3); and then the “ten horns”, that is, all the ruling powers of the nations, “receive power . . . with the beast,” the League of Nations combine being in fact a league of Fascism or</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">is always in disorder, and it is in this disorder that the Vatican has its greatest opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the last World War the pope tried to bring about a pehce, described at the time as “pro-Roman”, which would have been of great benefit to his establishment. It was not acceptcombined Fascist governments, dominated by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. “And the woman [Devil’s visible religious organization, the harlot] which thou sawest is that great city [the Hierarchy organization], which reigneth over [combined Fascism,] the kings of the earth.’’-Revelation 17:12,18.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>The Desire to Be Umpire</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">The desire to be umpire of earth’s affairs is always in the mind of every pope. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font8">for August 23, 1939, calls attention to proposals for a peace conference that the pope called or suggested calling prior to the outbreak of hostilities between Germany and Poland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In his series of collection envelopes on the one for the third week of September, 1939, Andrew J. Brennan, bishop of Richmond, Va., is made to say, “Responsibility to bring about and maintain a lasting peace, rests primarily upon the shoulders of Catholics in all nations.” The philosophy of this is that General Franco is a Catholic; if he had kept the peace in Spain, then Spain would not have been torn asunder by civil war. Mussolini is a Catholic; if he had kept the peace in Ethiopia, the lives of thousands of innocents would have been saved. Hitler is a Catholic • if he had kept the peace in Czechoslovakia and Poland, thousands would now be in comfort who today are either dead or in utter wretchedness. Japan is under Catholic influence, which partly accounts for the fact that there is no peace in Asia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">John T. Archbishop McNicholas, of Cincinnati, wants all Catholics in his realm to pray to Christ to grant peace to the whole world. If they thus pray they will be wasting their breath. The greatest war of all time, Armageddon, is ahead. The only survivors of that time will be those who are firmly on the Lord’s side, on the side of true Christianity, and against the Devil’s religion, which is its exact opposite, and of which the Roman Hierarchy is chief spokesman. ..</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A message from Vatican City stated that President Roosevelt had sent a personal message to the pope inviting him to call on him for assistance in connection with any international political scheme for '‘peace” he might have on hand. The message was conveyed, hot in a state paper, but by word of. mouth, through President Roosevelt’s close personal friend, Monsignor Amleto Giovanni Cicogna-ni, apostolic delegate to Washington.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Conditions in Europe</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">Says Martin Harbeck:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As f<sup>ar</sup> back as 1923 and 1924 Catholic priests and writers in Bavaria advo-<sup>ca</sup>f<sup>e(</sup>i a crusade against Jews, Communists, Pacifists and others, and * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preached the superiority of the Aryan</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">race. The storm troopers are nearly all very young men, taken, chiefly from Catholic families. They wear black uniforms, with a skull and • crossbones bn their hideous helmets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Germany, in man power, in money and in raw materials, is today less able than in 1914 to conduct a war with England and France on the other side. The arrogant dictators know that the so-called “democratic” and chiefly Protestant nations are readily bluffed by the Catholic-Fascist-Nazi combine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is sufficient evidence that neither the Germans nor the Austrians nor the Czechoslovakians ever had the opportunity of a free and uncontrolled ballot. It is now history that Hitler was greatly aided in his apparently miraculous rise to power by the Catholic element..His flfst success was in Bavaria, the most Catholic part of Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hitler speaks only behind bullet-proof glass, and for public demonstrations generally uses a double. Recently one such double, who was called his chauffeur, was shot and killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">My estimate is that forty percent of the people, the young who were greatly benefited by the Hitler regime, support the present Nazi government; a further forty percent are frightened into subjeer tion; and only about twenty percent are engaged in more or less active opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The economic crisis is world-wide; and being.a result of the World War, it can not be charged to any one government. But imported goods, particularly foodstuffs, are scarce in Germany. There is a marked shortage of coffee, butter, eggs, pork, good flour, sugar, onions and fruits; also of silks and woolen goods, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ .</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Hundreds of Thousands of Prisoners</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">Dr. Crone and other officials .of the so-called “Department of Justice” of Germany have freely admitted the ever more difficult problem of dealing with the many hundreds of thousands of prisoners created by the Hitler regime. Recently I had the pleasure of meeting a former German Minister of Justice, Dr. Breitscheidt. He declared that he greatly respects the Bible Students, or witnesses’ of Jehovah, 6,000 of whom are imprisoned in - Germany; because they are the only group of Christians suffering martyfSom for their faith and loyalty to God and to His Word. These ar-e the only ones who refuse to accept the Totalitarian religion; which places the State above God; and they refuse to honor or worship the human Fuehrer as God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The treatment of prisoners is not the same in all parts of Germany, and those actually in prison are less cruelly treated than those in concentration camps. But the crimes committed by the Nazi-gangsters, with the official approval of the present German government, cry to heaven; and if only a portion of them were known and believed by the honest people of the world, that knowledge would certainly cause all the good people in the world to turn away from such barbarians in disgust and abhorrence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ .......‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">'A truthful report of hundreds of such cases of ill-treatment of Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany was recently published by the Europa Publishers, at Zurich, Switzerland, in the German language, and now by the Presses Universilaires, in Paris, in the French language. The title of that book is &quot;Crusade Against Christianity”, Having read this book, a number of well-known writers, professional men and foremost journalists in Europe have expressed their deepest sympathy with these suffering and persecuted Christians. For example, Dr. Thomas Mann, the bearer of the Noble prize for literature, wrote concerning Jehovah’s witnesses ; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'■</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>“The Sufferings Left Behind''</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">I have read your book and its terrible documentation with deepest emotion. I cannot describe the mixed feeling of abhorrence and loathing which has filled my heart while perusing these records of human degradation and abominable cruelty. Human, speech fails in the presence of the unspeakable perversity revealed in these pages, on which are recorded the awful sufferings of innocent men and women who firmly hold fast to their faith. In viewing such indescribable conditions' the voice would fain be silent, but to keep quiet would serve only the moral indifference of the world, and further the despicable non-interference policy, and make for a guilty conscience. Will it be possible to shock the world oven for a moment by your presentation of these disgusting facts? One hardly dares to hope for it. At any rate you have done your duty in publishing this book and bringing these facts to light. It seems to me tliat. there is no greater appeal to the world’s conscience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Pastor T. Bruppacher, a thoughtful and noble-minded Protestant minister, wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While the German church controversy enjoys the favorable interest of official Christendom, we here have an' unobserved company, standing and Suffering in the foremost posts. While, men who call themselves Christians have failed in the decisive tests, these unknown witnesses of Jehovah, as Christian martyrs, are maintaining unshakable opposition against coercion of conscience and heal,hen idolatry. The future historian must some day acknowledge that not the great churches, but these slandered and scoffed-at people, were the ones who stood up first against the rage of the IS'azi demon, and who dared to make opposition according to the faith. They suffer and bleed because, as Jehovah 's witnesses and candidates for the-Kingdom of Christ, they refuse the worship of Hitler and the Swastika, These peculiar Christians are accounted worthy to suffer for His name’s sake, and they have humbly proved that they really know how to. def end their high title—that of Jehovah’s witnesses. Whoever permits these documents to speak to him in all their sincerity will begin to see the maligned Bible Students in a new light. Tic will riot again judge them in his own self-righteousness.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Witness Continues Despite Opposition</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">; The work of Jehovah’s witnesses, of informing the people of good will about Jehovah’s kingdom, and announcing the destruction of . the. wicked at Armageddon, progresses despite the opposition and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">OCTOBER 1.8, .1930 </span><span class="font8">persecution hi Germany. The witness work is increasing particularly in France, Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland, Thousands of people of good will are gladly hearing the message of the truth and are then leaving the Devil’s organization. Where formerly were small companies for Bible study there are now larger assemblies and.increased activities. In Germany, Jews, Communists, Socialists and other groups are silenced to a. large extent by the terror of the blackshirts, but not so Jehovah’s witnesses. It is often reported how they continue to speak of their faith, and they are even heard to sing joyfully’ in prison cells and concentration camps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The following is from, a Swiss newspaper, “The St. Gall Daily”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The French journalist, Jean Fontenoy, recently obtained permission to observe with his own eyes the life in the concentration camp Oranienburg. The commander of the camp, a general, personally took the journalist through the camp. A. lengthy report has appeared in the &quot;Journal” regarding this inspection. We give, herewith an abbreviated but faithful report concerning what the commander thinks of the Bible Students—Jehovah’s witnesses- -and how he tries to solve the problem they create for him,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;The Bible Students,” grumbled the general. &quot;I have erected special barracks for them, where they sire isolated behind barbed wire which is electrically-charged, in order that they may not got in contact with the other inmates. It is forbidden for others to come closer than seven yards to the barracks of the Bible Students, Hut nothing avails. Tf I forbid them to smoke, they say they don ’t smoko at all. Tf I permit them to write only one letter every third month, they do not even write that one letter. It is really distracting. Recently the wife of such a Bible Student name and begged for her husband’s release. I had the man brought, but he looked at his Wife ns if ho did not know her. Sho cried and pleaded, saying, ‘ We have nothing to eat and 1 have no one to help) us. ’ The Bible .Student answered, 'You have Jehovah.’. The woman; 'I plead with you to sign the pledge and return to us.’ The man: ‘Go and pray more earnestly to Jehovah. ’ ” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The general engaged in a dialogue between himself and Johann Huber, 27 years of age. He asked, &quot;Why are you in the concentration camp?” &quot;Because I have worshiped the Lord.” &quot;Which Lord?” &quot;Jehovah.” &quot;Do you acknowledge our Fuehrer as your head or superior?” &quot;I do not know of whom you speak; my superior or head is Jehovah.” &quot;Who am I?” &quot;You are one of Jehovah’s creatures.” &quot;Arn I your superior or not?” &quot;You are a creature of Jehovah.” &quot;Do you have to obey me or not?” &quot;I have to obey Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The general turned to me with a bitter smile and said, &quot;You cannot do a thing with them, neither with mildness nor with harshness; it is all of no avail..’! This dialogue had .been listened to with visible pleasure by about- fifty other prisoners near by. The commander asked, ‘ 'Did ydu observe these others? Do you Understand now. why I keep the Bible Students apart from the others? They would. start a small revolution .'within a'.few hours; .'they are. .rim worst, of them all.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ , &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■*&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This discussion had caused me to think</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">and later, at noon, I referred again to this theme of the Bible Students and said, “You have here 450 Bible Students </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">VjitH'®&quot;</span><span class="font8"> m this eamp, but do they really belong </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“ &gt;m</span><span class="font8"> Uere? Most of them must be good and harmless people; they seem to me to be somewhat like saints, at any rate really harmless. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A Berlin official accompanying the party through the camp stated it is hard to find the secret places in Germany where the Bible Students’ literature is still being printed; no one carries names or addresses and no one betrays another. When 250 were arrested at Hamburg and their papers and press were confiscated, and it was thought that this would stop the circulation of a certain magazine, within two weeks after the raid the paper reappeared as before and the police had not been able since then to discover the place where printed, nor any of the distributors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This firmness of faith and unparalleled courage causes many who witness the terrible persecutions to inquire as to the source of such steadfastness. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font8">number of cases are known where prison guards and other prisoners have forsaken all else to put themselves on the Lord’s side while yet there is time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A righteous indignation against the instigators of the persecutions of Jehovah’s witnesses, namely, the Catholic-Fascist combine, wells up in the heart of every real Christian. Thia persecution of Christians is a fulfillment of Divine prophecy. Other prophecies show that the day of accounting for the great bloodguilt which the present generation has heaped upon itself is at hand.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Hitler Guided by Demons</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">The statement that Hitler is a close student of astrology, and that he maps his course by the stars, is only another way of saying that he is guided by demons. The teaching that any man is guided in his course by any star or any combination of stars is a denial of every truth contained in the Scriptures. That does not mean that the demons are ignorant of what is going on in the world, and it does not mean they cannot twist together plausible statements supposedly but not actually in harmony with the. movements of the stars. So it is not without interest that in her dispatch to the Chicago </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune,</span><span class="font8"> from Berlin, on July 13, Sigrid Schultz, who familiarized herself with the teachings of Hitler’s astrologers, reports one of them as saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Russia and Germany together will settle the Polish problem. The world wall be astounded by the developments of the next few weeks. When Russia and Germany co-operate the British empire will automatically fall asunder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hitler is guided by “voices” (which are the voices of wicked spirits), and it is all in vain that Churchill appealed to him to consider the consequences of a single rash act which might ruin bis life’s work, and that Eden and Halifax tried to reason with him. The demons are out to wreck the world, and only God’s almighty hand can frustrate their design. Human wisdom will be unavailing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Nothing that the man says can be believed. He is probably the world’s most shameless liar. Somebody noticed that the letters in A H-I-T-L-E-R and T-H-E L-I-A-R are the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Early in 1937 laws were passed in Germany prohibiting Germans from participating in the war in Spain. At that very time the German troops were pouring in, and it was German transport planes, in the very first hours of the conspiracy, that carried thousands of heathen Moors into Spain to there fight the pope’s battles. Said Thomas Mann, German author, in an address at Princeton University:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Germany fell into the hands of leaders so depraved that perhaps in all history there has been recorded no second case of such dishonor to spirit and intellect, justice, truth and freedom. Their reign of violence has made it impossible for anyone who has some feeling for human dignity and moral responsibility to breathe the air of that country.—New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">’World-Telegram.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On Monday, September 4, only the next day after Britain declared that a state of war prevailed as between it and Germany, the British Government bombarded the people of the Reich with 6,000,000 leaflets containing assurance that the war is not against the German people but against this colossal liar, Hitler, trained by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and by the Devil for the work he is now doing. The broadcast leaflets contained in German these statements:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“He [Hitler] gave his word that he would respect the Locarno Treaty; he broke it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“He gave his word that he neither wished nor intended to annex Austria; he broke it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“He declared he would not incorporate the Czechs in the Reich; he did so. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“He gave his word after Munich that he had no further territorial demands in Europe; he broke it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“He gave his word he wanted no Polish provinces; he broke it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“He has sworn to you for years he was the mortal enemy of Bolshevism; he is now its ally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;Can you wonder that for us his word is not worth the paper it is written oaf”—New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Post,</span><span class="font8"> September 4, 1939.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Could a Whole People Worship a Liar?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">Oddly enough, the answer to the question, “Could a w’hole people worship a liart” is a most emphatic Yes. The world as a whole has done that very thing from the time of Lucifer's lie in the garden of Eden until this, very moment. The Devil, using religion and ’ religionists as his vehicles of expression, has so thoroughly established in the minds of the people that they live on after they are dead that “the whole world lieth in the wicked one” and there are few that believe the statement of-the Creator himself that “the dead know not any thing”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Below is set out some of the evidence that many Of the German people have actually made this Jesuit-trained man. Hitler, into a “god” (as Moses was made a god in Pharaoh’s eyes). In its Celebration Number, in answer to the question, &quot;What does The Fuehrer mean to you?” the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Schwarzs Korns</span><span class="font8"> published the following. President Roosevelt, who wants the people to have more religion, and the New York Chamber of Commerce, that wants the people to have, more religion, and all the other panjandrums that recommend religion as a eure-all, would do well to ponder deeply.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">1) (A Viennese) “My Fuehrer gave me not only a political ^Weltanschauung’ but also a religion. He gave me a faith, which even as a child I had never possessed. This faith is a faith in ourselves, in our strength and our greatness, in the mysterious power of Blood, our Soil and the German nation. ...”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">2) (An S.S. Man.) “Even to attempt to put into words what I feel for my Fuehrer appears to me profane. ... It makes my heart heavy to think that the Fuehrer today belongs to so many, whereas during the time of our early struggle, he belonged only to us, a comparatively few. J am jealous of every person with.whom J must share him. May 1 be forgiven for this sacred egoism.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">3) . (A Party member in Berlin) “Formerly we were brought up to be religious, trained in a faith divorced from reality, which seemed impersonal, abstract and un-Gcrman. This outlook did not improve roan, hardly strengthened him, but rather deprived him of courage and initiative, . . . Faith in the Fuehrer and his work have given me strength to force friy life to higher things. In this godless, mammon-worshiping world, tom with hate and murder, this world of insanity and chaos, a temple of light has ariseh, throwing its rays afar snd pointing to a future far more beautiful than our past.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">4) (A lawyer from Dortmund) “We know that we are in the grip of a feeling whose essence and depth we can scarcely determine and which renders' us dumb. Reverence, love, loyalty, gratitude, self-ihnegation—all make up this feeling which yet Surpasses them all. But the most revered father, the most deeply loved mother, the most loyal wife ahd the most trusted friend rouse in our hearts music far less exalted than the song our souls sing to the Fuehrer.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">5) (A Party member from Berlin) “I left the Church with the firm conviction that the Christian religion was a man-made faith professing to be the will of God, but having nothing in common with that power which we call God, I believe the fellowship of blood and race is a fellow-ship much more desired by God than all the religious fellowships built up by man. I frequently ponder, could I face my Leader and Father, Adolf Hitler, if he knew my thoughts and my work. My religious observance is a daily hour of quiet thought. . . . And then an inner glow- comes upon me, an indescribable feeling of satisfaction, if after mature consideration, I come to the conclusion that my father, Adolf Hitler, would bless this or that action of mine.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">6) (Another Party member) “Every flower that blooms, blooms in gratitude to him; every apple that ripens, ripens in gratitude to him.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">7) (A Hamburg woman) “I should like to say once Cor all, that the lofty teaching of my Fuehrer .is now my religion, the German religion, and I can think of nothing finer.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">8) (A Reader from Frankfurt) “What misuse is made by men of the word ‘Fuehrer’. This word should only be applied to Adolf Hitler himself and ive should impregnate our people from youth up with reverence for this word as the Christian Church reveres the name of God.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">9) (A Mother in Unterammergau) “My children know the Fuehrer as a man, who orders all things, rules all things, who built the world. The Fuehrer is for my children that visible Being, which we as children were taught to recognise as God. . .</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">These people worship Hitler; Hitler worships the Roman Catholic system in which he was trained --it is his god; and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy worships and serves the Devil, manifests his spirit and is his most devoted and most honored child. Ths chain is complete. The German people that worship Hitler arc worshiping the Devil, whether they know it or not.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Inordinate Vanity and Cowardice</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">The German people in all lands have done all they could to make a fool of Hitler, and he has cheerfully gone them one better every time. The golden crown presented to him at the middle of June is said to have been paid for by Nazis in 61 countries. Those at Buenos Aires alone contributed 31,455 pesos ($7,700) of the amount, so says the newspaper </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Crltica </span><span class="font8">of that city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is admitted by all who have listened to him that Hitler has the power to produce mass hypnotism of his audiences. Maas hypnotism is mass demonism; but the demons are no fools. They have had centuries of experience, and so they select for their work some man who can be used to &quot;put it across”.<sup>1</sup> Hitler is such a man. The following from </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Mein Kampf </span><span class="font8">shows that even he himself does not fully realize that the power working through him is not himself, but that of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">WHOM?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Meetings at which I talked about the peace treaties seemed never to end, for I considered this a vital subject and repeated my speech of denunciation again and again in endless repetition;</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19391018_files/g_E_19391018-4.png" alt="" style="width:44pt;height:43pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">I gradually put it in better form until at last I was driving a powerful message into the heart of the people. This constant practice in addressing meetings slowly but surely made me elever in the use of the pathos and the gestures needed to sway audiences of thousands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I began to talk—and kept on talking for around two and one-half-hours—and I at once felt that the meeting was to be a great success. Immediately I was in contact with the audience. After an hour. applause broke out more and more often, in great outbursts, and then ebbed away after two hours, until I finished in that solemn silence which will never be forgotten by a soul who was there, and ■which I afterwards experienced so many times in this room. Almost nothing but the soft breathing of the mass could be heard, and suddenly when I had finished applause rose like thunder, and then release was found in fervent singing of &quot;Deutschland ueber Alles”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Every dictator is a personal coward, and has to be; for his life is constantly at stake, because of the wrongs of which he is guilty. The claim is now made that Hitler has a private tunnel twelve miles long, between his hideout at Berchtesgaden and the city of Salzburg, enough to give him a good start if it ever becomes necessary for him to make a quick getaway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">His plane is of sufficient capacity to fly non-stop from Berlin to New York, and it has been fitted with every comfort and safety gadget known to man. It has four engines and a speed of 220 miles an hour. It is not a bad investment for him, and he may need it yet. New York city would find an empty apartment for him and he would hold the headlines for three days, maybe four, before he shriveled to his true size and passed out of public notice.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Bedtime Stories of Persecution</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">In order to put over its seizure of the world the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is bound to pretend that it is suffering persecution, even while its faithful sons are breaking every law known to man. These columns have contained many pages of evidence that there is no persecution of the Roman Catholic Church in Ger&lt;-many. There is fresh evidence for this' issue, and here it is, from Catholic sources:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Little by little the truth gradually leaks out on all subjects, for the reason that the Lord himself has stated that &quot;there is nothing covered but shall be revealed”. In view, therefore, of the oft-repeated yarns in the kept press about mistreatment of the Catholic Church in Germany, it is with some interest that the following statements are taken from a column by the Catholic writer Bertram de Colonna, published in the London </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">While it is true that there have been differences between some Catholics and officials in Germany, there has never been any prohibition of church services, nor have any churches been burned and sacked, or priests ill-treated or murdered in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Anyone who takes the trouble to visit a Catholic part of Germany will see that priests and lay brothers go about their business untroubled. Lay brothers serve in the beer rooms attached to monasteries in many parts, and groups of excursionists, .largely wearing badges of the National Socialist Party, drop in there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The London </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Universe</span><span class="font8"> states that on Hitler’s birthday Cardinal Innitzer ordered all Austrian churches to ring bells, fly the Swastika flag and say special prayers for the Fuehrer. Does that look like persecution?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mosley, Britain’s would-be Hitler, in a speech at North London, said of religious persecution in Germany:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J think the clash between State and Church in Germany will soon end. There has, after all, been friction between the temporal and spiritual power in Germany for centuries, on and off. At present more money is paid by the State to the Church than ever before and more people attend ehureh than ever before.—In London </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Disposing now of a couple of widely publicized claims of &quot;persecution”, here are the facts, and facts are all anyone should desire. Read them and judge for yourself. Hereafter, in what was once Austria, there will be joint control of promotions in the Roman Catholic’s clergy. There are to be no changes -in personnel except such as meet Nazi approval. The Nazis will also decide who are to study for the priesthood. The New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span><span class="font8"> devoted its entire front page to the idea that the' Nazis had stormed the archbishop’s palace 'at Salzburg, whereas the simple facts are that-the building belonged to the Government since 1802, and the latter part of April notice had been served on the archbishop to look for other quarters. He neglected to do so and, after a</span></p><img src="g_E_19391018_files/g_E_19391018-5.png" alt="" style="width:199pt;height:74pt;">
<p><span class="font8">month’s delay, one time when he came back he found the landlord in control and himself dispossessed. Subsequently the archbishop Sigismund Waitz was offered the free use of several rooms in the palace, but he thought the Hierarchy would gain more by maintaining its pretense of “persecution”, so he took up his residence in one of the many monasteries with which the neighborhood is cursed, instead.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>In Austria and Czechoslovakia</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">The basis for stories of persecution of the Catholic Church in Austria seems to arise from the fact that up to September 1, 1939, each Homan Catholic priest received from the government an allowance of 120 marks monthly, but after that date Catholics, like other persons, would be taxed to maintain their churches and priests. Hitherto; because theirs was the State church, Catholics did not pay any religious tax.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Having conspired with Hitler to destroy the Republic of Czechoslovakia, and his own priests having been in the forefront in the betrayal of that country, once the center of Protestantism in Europe, the pope now tells the Slovak premier that he will need “much perspicacity and prudence, a great deal of brotherly feeling”, etc., etc., to get along with tiie present situation (in which everything of any value in the country is being lugged off to Germany and the Czechoslovakian people are being turned into slaves).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Under the title “Who Sent Reverend Kochis to Make Speeches Here?” the Gary .(Ind.) </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Post Tribune</span><span class="font8"> quoted the “Reverend Father” John Kochis as lauding the German government to the skies and saying that the people of Slovakia are perfectly satisfied with it. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Post Tribune</span><span class="font8"> knows perfectly well who sent the “Reverend Father” Kochis to Gary. It also knows that if it mentioned the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in that connection it would lose most of its advertisers and subscribers. But, viewed from a distance, it is a safe bet that it will be disciplined for its editorial which winds up with this paragraph:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">, When Reverend Kochis attempts to present the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">octAber is,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hitler thugs, gunmen and plain assassins as worthy rulers for their own protection he is dealing in a brand of bunkum that won’t go far in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The editor of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Post Tribune</span><span class="font8"> is no fool. He knows that the “Reverend Father” Tiso betrayed what was left of his country into the hands of- Hitler, and did it to crush Protestants throughout the republic. Earlier in the editorial he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Who is this Reverend Kochis, and what is his purpose in this country? Was he sent over here by the German-controlled government of Dr. Tiso to pull the wool over the eyes of Slovaks living in America ?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>“More Food for Apes”</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">The London </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald</span><span class="font8"> contained a five-column interview with Sir Oswald Mosley entitled “Mosley Discusses Need Church and State Clash”, in which Mosley made it clear that his outfit, if it gains control of Britain, will “always treat the spiritual and moral authority of the Vatican in international affairs with the utmost respect”. In the next issue the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font8"> seemed to be referring to its own readers when it Used the headline which introduces this paragraph. Mosley admits that he has more Catholics in his outfit than their proportion in the country would warrant. It is all as plain as day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Our Sunday Visitor</span><span class="font8"> takes gleeful note that the Rome-directed Germany-Italy-Japan axis could, in a few years, crush the democracies by birth rates alone. It mentions that while, in England, other schools are forced to close because of decreased attendance, yet Catholic schools in that country have actually increased in number, even though there has been a slight decrease in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Speaking of conditions in France, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Our Sunday Visitor</span><span class="font8"> of July 16, 1939, also said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The older ones among our readers will recall that, nearly forty years ago, the then President of France dissolved the Concordat which France had had with the Holy See, and not only forced all Religious Orders to give up the work of teaching in school, but forbade them to wear their religious garb. Such a change lias eome over France in recent years that these laws have been disregarded, but because they are still on the Statute Books, there is now a movement in Parliament itself to repeal the hostile legislation. In fact, a bill is ready for presentation to Parliament; already backed by more than 200 Deputies, to repeal the law against Religious Orders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is hard to choose between murderers, and say which<sub>:</sub> is the more shameless,; Hitler with his rapes of Austria and Czechoslovakia, or Mussolini with his rapes of Ethiopia and </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Al</span><span class="font8">bania, or both of them in their rape of Spain. The pope has just now &quot;blessed&quot; Mussolini, publicly asking God’s blessing on his head. Now he should dp the same for Hitler, and thpp for Al Capone, “Father” Coughlin and Judge Manton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Within the past few years three prominent persons have been made Knights of the Order pf the Annunciation. The first was Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, the second was King </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Zvg</span><span class="font8"> of Albania, and the third was von Ribbentrop, the German Foreign minister.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">settled policy of the “church”, and IKKKfl is policy only. It is perfectly willing to have millions of Catholics killed on each </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">side </span><span class="font8">in any war, if only the interests of the racket operating out of Vatican City are taken eare of. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In an address in New York city, as reported' </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font8">the Baltimore </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Sun,</span><span class="font8"> the “Most Reverend&quot; James E, Kearney, bishop of Salt Lake, made the statement,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“There is only one flag for our children and that is the American flag. The children are taught to salute it under penalty of disrespect to Almighty God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">. The bishop could use the same argument to Hitler regarding saluting the swastika and it would be just as true. Indeed, Catholic bishops in Austria and Germany have repeat</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">edly </span><span class="font8">urged their flocks to vote for Hitler and to support him in every way in the work of the Devil in which he is engaged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Commonweal,</span><span class="font8"> a Catholic magazine, seems to hit the nail on the head when it says </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font8">“Reverend Father” Coughlin that he is given to “all too pious acceptance of propaganda from a party whose Fuehrer proudly boasts his machine is based on huge lies”. That is an ingenious way of calling both Hitler and Coughlin liars in a single sentence. And it diverts attention from the wicked Hierarchy itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font8">Roman Catholic Hierarchy is not </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">be</span><span class="font8">ing persecuted in the United States, but it is persecuting others for the very same reason that it is now sympathetic with the idea of another huge war.

<p><span class="font8">Governor Lehman, of New York State; is</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">an intelligent, well-read man. He can hardly be ignorant of the more than 2,000 eases of persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses, in almost every state in the United &lt;&nbsp;States, their arrest, imprisonment, beating, choking, tarring and feathering, and other abuse, mainly by agents of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. How, then, is it that he could say, in his address to the United Spanish War Veterans: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

When the bombs fall there is no gas mask that can withstand the smoke that issues forth from these bombs, As the odor penetrates the mask the wearer becomes deathly sick, yanks off the mask and dies.

This column, published June 21, drew attention to “the. published intimation that His Holiness the Pope would look with apprehension upon a tripartite Anglo - French - Soviet pact” (because that would hinder the loyal Catholic Hitler from overrunning the world), and contained the following paragraph which, for reasons best known to themselves, other newspapermen avoid mentioning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Economic experts believe the church’s holdings in Greater Germany, which (excluding Czechoslovakia) are reliably estimated at equivalent to about $20,-000,000,000, may have been a determining factor. Also, the Vatican's conviction that German expansion into the east —into predominant Catholic areas—is a foregone conclusion; hence, that a modus viventli with the reich is not only desirable, but imperative. High Catholic circles, incidentally, are convinced that a growing number</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">of Catholics among German population will in time be a moderating influence per se, and should therefore be cultivated. That Vatican influence has been steadily rising in England in the last two years is an open secret.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As is well known, the rearming of Germany was both physical and mental. Hitler is a past master in the art of rabble-rousing, feebly imitated in the United States by “Father”</span></p>

Respecting Hitler’s achievements over the radio (worked out largely by Goebbels, his propaganda manager) Edgar Weir, in the London </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">News Chronicle</span><span class="font8"> of April 11, 1939, wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Radio propaganda is like the fascinating eye of a serpent that attempts to hypnotize its victim until it allows itself to be swallowed without resistance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Germany has recently developed an entirely new system of expansion. After a period of “build-up” to win the confidence of foreign listeners, they are gradually treated to more and more propaganda describing the beauties of Germany and how smoothly everything works there. Then they are told of the terrible conditions in other countries, including their own. They are taught to be discontented with their own governments. They are promised mountains of gold and good things. Finally, the broadcasts take on an aggressive tone. They become less truthful. What the Germans call “Hetzpro pagan da” and “Atrocity Propaganda”, and of which they accuse the foreign Press and radio, is used with great effect by their own stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the Titanic was finished and started on its maiden trip it was announced that it was unsinkable. It never got across even once. It ran into an iceberg and, after being sliced from end to end, went down off Newfoundland, to rise no more. More recently the Fuehrer completed, at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars and with the aid of 300,000 slaves, a 400-mile line of forts from Switzerland to the Netherlands. Hitler pronounced the completed line as invincible and impregnable, and within a week the Rhine rose to an unwonted height and swamped machine-gun nests and would have drowned their occupants except that they could and did flee to higher ground. The story came from France. The Germans say it is not true.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Saturday Evening Post</span><span class="font8"> of May 27, 1939, features an article entitled “Star-Spangled Fascists”, under a large photograph of a nocturnal conclave of such, in which the An) eri can flag occupies a prominent place. To the average American reader, blindfolded and unwary, this article puts across with power the idea that American democracy is both helpless and hopeless before a few un-American upstarts whose background is dark, whose organizations are secret, and whose mysterious finances “come in over the transom”. This article is eited at random as a fair sample of that which is supposedly and allegedly “best” in American journalism. Such journalism is supposedly and allegedly &quot;&nbsp;uneenso red” an d“ free ”, and is confessedly 100-pereent (or more) “patriotic”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Why, in such published articles, is not the darkness of the average unwary reader enlightened with a reminder that democracy has. plenty of old, grayheaded laws on the subjects of sedition and treason? Why is not the publie awakened to know that the mass of published and admitted facts prove beyond all doubt that there are many Fascist and Nazi seditionists and traitors at work in this country, and that the laws have teeth in them for such? Why is real 100-percent democratic action, that is, patriotic law enforcement, not even mentioned, much less advocated ? Whj’ ? The plain answer may be summed up in two words, namely, “Catholic Action”; but from-the sepulcher of a free and patriotic journalism comes only the resounding echo, “Why?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All national, state and city officials have taken patriotic baths to promote the general welfare of the people who pay them by justly and diligently upholding and enforcing the Constitution and laws of America. Where are these officials while AiaiiT-iean liberties are sacked and exported to Rome? Why is no traitor even “out on bail”? Why do seditionists roam at large with unlimited freedom of press and radio to advocate “bullets instead of ballots” and the impaling of law-abiding citizens on red-hot spikes? Why are such wicked and wholesale crimes camouflaged and countenanced as “constitutional liberties” by an emasculated press and by a supine and cringing officialdom? To real patriotic, law-abiding Americans such as Jehovah’s witnesses, the strong-arm squad makes answer with a cuff and a curse: “Stop telling on them! Shut up!!

<p><span class="font8">Under the title “The Coughlin Terror”, James Wechsler, in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Nation</span><span class="font8"> for July 22, 1939, has over five pages of exceedingly interesting information regarding the peculiar</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19391018_files/g_E_19391018-9.png" alt="" style="width:42pt;height:42pt;">

<p><span class="font8">conduct of many of the 12,000 Irish Catholic policemen in New York in Coughlin’s so-called “Christian Front”. One of their number boasted that 6,000 of the police are members of the “Front” itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Wechsler mentions the repeated stabbings, street fights and neighborhood tensions that have come to pass, and how, because of fear of the Catholic Church, the reporters of the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font8"> take their stories to the executive offices, not to the composing room, and the antique </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Herald Tribune</span><span class="font8"> follows suit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A young girl hears one of the Coughlinites making attacks on parties designated only by the word “they”. She timidly asks the speaker who is meant. Immediately a hundred Catholies are kicking and pushing and pummeling, and two men grab her and throw her down. She is rescued by two policemen, but no arrests are made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Samuel Applebaum, for saying to a husky Irish Catholic gangster in Union Square, “We Jews also fought in the World War,” was attacked and stabbed and at last accounts the ease had been postponed four times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Coughlin’s followers sell his paper “Social Justice” all over New York, but when a gentleman who believes in fair play was handing out reprints from the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font8"> showing where Coughlin had been repeating the very words of Goebbels, John Dugan (guess hi$ “church”) walked over and without warning knocked the man senseless on the ground. Dugan offered no defense, was praised for his frankness, was told to count thirty before doing it again, and sentence was suspended. At his trial one of the judges on the bench admonished witnesses to disobey the command of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and to refer to Coughlin as “Father” Coughlin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">By contrast, when Thomas Maloney called </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">girl who was passing by a “Jew bastard”, and Nathan Smulin, also a passer-by, seized </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">one </span><span class="font8">of Maloney’s papers and slapped him with it, Smulin<sup>1</sup> was arrested, not Maloney, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">end </span><span class="font8">Magistrate Burke (guess his “church”) added “malicious mischief” to the charge of simple assault and held him in $2,000 bail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When a public-school teacher started to argue with one of the “Social Justice” salesmen she was called vile names and jostled, and when a near-by storekeeper went to her rescue he was arrested. The salesmen of “Social Justice” have developed the lying technique of punctuating their cries of the name of their paper with expressions such as </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“A </span><span class="font8">big Jew hit me” or “The Jew spit on her”. And this method works. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘ :</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Rockaway Park, where “Social Justice” has been sold on the streets for months, when a man undertook to sell “Equality”, telling the other side of the story, his papers were thrown to the ground, and as he stooped to pick them up he was kicked in the head; and while he lay sprawled on the ground one of the two idle policemen standing by fractured his skull by a blow with his club. Fine officers of the law! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the other hand, at Union Square, William Frank, previously arrested for raping a ,minor and for burglary, accosted a young girl, calling her a “red whore”, but because he was selling “Social Justice” his sentence was deferred. In the court of Magistrate Michael </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A. </span><span class="font8">Ford, Miss Florence Nash, another abusive salesman of “Social Justice”, was given a suspended sentence of thirty days in the workhouse. All she had to do was to weep-a little. The magistrate did say to her, “He who instills such ideas in your head, be he a priest or anyone else, does not belong in this country.” Coughlin can take that-or leave it; and he will probably leave it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of course, it is enough of a disgrace to be a Coughlinite. That of itself is bad enough. It is well known that Allen Zoll was chairman of the meeting, addressed by numerous Catholic priests, which resulted in the picketing of radio station WMCA because it would not broadcast Coughlin’s .addresses. It seems that five days after the Coughlinites tried to break up the meeting of Jehovah’s witnesses in Madison Square Garden, Zoll thought the time had come to cash in, so, as alleged, he offered, for the sum of $7,000, to have the picketing of WMCA cease and was paid $200 in marked money, cash in hand. Then he was arrested and jailed. ,</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Fighting for Liberty in Hubbard, Ohio</span></h4>
<p><span class="font17">H</span><span class="font8">UBBARD, Ohio, is only a small village of about 2,500 inhabitants. Yet, in the more recent past, it has assumed the position of censoring other people’s activities. It has gone on record “against God’s kingdom”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the following I shall relate a remarkable story of chicanery on the side of Hubbard, and of faithfulness on the side of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some months ago a company of Jehovah’s witnesses was organized, a hall was rented in Hubbard, and from the very small beginning of 8 publishers this company rapidly flourished all the way up to 28 publishers. The enemy did not like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Like all companies, this company began walking on the sidewalks of Hubbard, advertising their public meetings. The religionists there, led by one “Rev.” Brennan, Catholic priest, objected strenuously to the sign “Religion is a Snare and a Racket” and caused the police to remonstrate with the witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On May 13, a Saturday, the witnesses walked up and down Hubbard streets. They were stopped by the marshal. He told them they had to get a permit. The witness went on, heedless of this marshal’s warning. On May 15, the very next legal business day, the council of the village scurried together, which meeting resulted in the concoction of “An Ordinance of Emergency” ostensibly directed against Jehovah’s witnesses. Ordinarily, hereabout, it takes three readings to make an ordinance lawful. In this ease it was done overnight. This ordinance made the securement of a permit mandatory. The speed with which this ordinance was enacted, the language in which it was couched, and the extraordinary power it grants the executive, form only a thinly veiled attempt at coercion and intimidation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thus they hoped to stop the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. But Jehovah’s witnesses' do not scare. On May 27, Hubbard police picked up two men, and charged them with violating this ordinance. A trial was set. The arrests took place at 6 p.m. on Saturday, and only fourteen hours later Jehovah’s witnesses retaliated with a blast of publicity. Fifteen thousand folders entitled “Two Christians Arrested in Hubbard” were spread all over the Mahoning Valley, inviting the people to come to a Protest meeting to be held at the hall of Jehovah’s witnesses at Hubbard at 3 p.m. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">OCTOBER 18, 1839</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Six hundred people arrived. A loud-speaker equipment was installed on the premises and outlets were arranged for on the grounds surrounding the building, which were under lease by Jehovah’s witnesses. As the speaker progressed, about ten minutes, Marshal Greer appeared and insisted the loud-speaker be disconnected. Jehovah’s witnesses refused to yield. Finally, Greer, heroically, pulled his gun, and tore down the equipment, and thus broke up a peaceable assembly of Americans without a warrant of search and seizure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses did not take that lying down. On the following Saturday, June 10, 85 walked into Hubbard featuring signs. Thirty-four were picked up by the police, among them 18 children, and, without due process of law, were incarcerated for two to two and a quarter hours and then released without filing charges. Jehovah’s witnesses immediately countered with twenty damage suits against the officials of Hubbard for $5,000 each, for false arrests, and for defamation of character. Then a definite plan of resistance was put into action, a slow war of attrition began.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">1. Fifty thousand pamphlets, telling the story of Hubbard persecution, were printed and widely distributed,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">2. On all highways leading into Hubbard land was leased, and huge signs “Hubbard ig Unfair; Hubbard is un-American” were erected, and these picket posts were manned by faithful witnesses, and for eight weeks now this has gone on uninterrupted, the witnesses distributing specially arranged handbills, published once every fortnight, and placing thousands of booklets. The total of placements up to the present, on these “picket-posts”, has been 22,500. A truly remarkable witness. From far and wide, cars have stopped and received this information, ,from everywhere.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">This has made great inroads on Hubbard, and their reputation is nil at the present. In an editorial the editor of the Hubbard </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">N-ews </span><span class="font8">writes thus:</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>The American Legion</span></h4>
<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font8">N ARDENT member of the American</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Legion, who is also an enthusiastic sup* porter of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy organization, recently stated to me the following : ‘‘The American Legion stands for everything that is American.” If that statement were literally true no American citizen could find fault with the Legion. It is not true. The so-called ‘‘American Legion” stands for many things that are not American. The real brains of the organization, the men who conceived the idea of the organization and the building of it up in the United States for selfish purposes, are men of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, who proceed under the immediate direction of Vatican City. That organization, of course, is foreign to America and is against the foundation principles of the American government. No doubt many sincere Americans, because they were in the World War, have been induced to join this Legion upon the representation that it is for the purpose of protecting American interests. In this they have been deceived, as all the facts show. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and the Fascists are working together to gain control of America, and they proceed always in a subtle manner so as to conceal their real purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The American Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, freedom.of assembly, and freedom of worship of Almighty God. The American Legion is against all of these fundamental principles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the instance of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and the Legion, and a similar organization called the “Americanization Assembly”, two bills were introduced in the Legislature of California during the year, which bills if they had been enacted into law would destroy the liberties guaranteed by the American Constitution. One of those bills would compel the school children to salute the flag, even though such children have been taught and believe that the law of Almighty God is supreme and it is their duty to obey God’s law, which law of God forbids any Christian to bow down to or salute any flag, image or person. That bill would put the law of the State as supreme and above the law of Almighty God, and is therefore against the principles of the American Constitution. Long ago the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the United States is a Christian nation, which means that the law of God is supreme and must be obeyed rather than the law of man. Good citizens of the United States for 150 years have obeyed the law of the land without being compelled to violate the law of God, But the Vatican and the Legion would coerce the people into disregarding God’s law and obeying man’s law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another bill was introduced and pressed in the Legislature,' making it a crime to publish, print, write or multigraph any book, speech, article, statement, circular or pamphlet, or for any person to have in his possession such literature, that in any way or in any part thereof might tend to promote hostility to a religious organization. Manifestly that bill originated with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and the purpose was to prevent anyone from publishing anything that exposes the duplicity of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their wrongful efforts to grab control of the American government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Governor Olson, who is a broad-minded American and who believes in the principles of the American Constitution, was against said bills. Because thereof the Catholic Press and the American Legion have abused the governor and referred to him as a supporter of Communism, well knowing that such publication is false. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Everywhere in the earth the Roman Catholic Hierarchy brands all opponents of the Catholic system as Communists. From their viewpoint everyone in America who does not agree with the efforts of the Vatican to gain control of America is branded as a Communist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is well known that the Vatican and Fascism and Nazism work hand in glove together. Since the beginning of war by Hitler against England and France a representative of Hitler, at a Bund meeting in Philadelphia, boldly announced that Hitler could whip the whole -world. There was no effort on the part of the Legion ot the Roman Catholic organization to stop that meeting or to even criticize the speaker. Certainly the spreading of propaganda by such men as Kuhn is against Amerr ican principles. The Legion winks at such with evident </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Recently the Legion and the Roman Catholic : Hierarchy joined in an effort to prevent</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Christians in the city of San Antonio,. Texas, from advertising their meeting to study the Bible. Shortly thereafter the American Legion and the Kaman Catholic Hierarchy organized a mob against a Communist meeting, and in the same city. It is true that American citizens are not in favor of Communism, but the mayor of the city held that in harmony with the Constitution they had a right to meet. The American Legion, and the Koman Catholic organization, led by a Catholic priest, broke up that meeting and assaulted the police, and were guilty of many acts of open violence. Certainly that conduct could not be classed as Americanism!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Recently the American Legion and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy have attempted to break up meetings of Christian people assembled in Seattle, Washington, in Portland, Oregon, in New Orleans, in Oklahoma, and in many other parts of the United States. The same combination in Hubbard, Ohio, has caused a reign of terror in that part of the state in the past few weeks in their efforts to prevent Christian people from assembling and peaceably worshiping Almighty God. Much more evidence can be furnished, of course, showing the un-American conduct of the combination of Fascists, Nazis, Roman Catholic Hierarchy and the so-called “American Legion” indulging in that which is wholly contrary to the principles guaranteed by the American Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When an organization, such as the so-called “American Legion”, brings before the people accusations against a high-minded American citizen like Governor Olson they should come with clean hands. Their hands are anything but . clean, and their criticism of Governor Olson will not be endorsed by any American citizens who love righteousness and hate iniquity, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The American people are not all being deceived by the garb worn by men who claim to be safeguarding American interests. It will be found upon investigation that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is instigating all such movements to tear down the morale of America and to turn the people away from a democratic form of government, and, above all, to turn them away from the worship of Almighty God and the support of His kingdom under Christ. The American Legion is another religious institution. It puts fear into the minds of men, and the result is to draw them into the Devil’s snare: “The fear of man bringeth a snare; but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe.”—Proverbs 29: 25.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">tion is, do we deserve the reputation we are getting or are we less astute in the sense of publicity and less anxious to make our town look stupid than some persons who enjoy the facilities of the town to promote their religious beliefs? . , , Others feel that if the group had been permitted to go about its activities of parading, even without a permit passing literature, conducting mass meetings, unmolested, there would have been no trouble. Regardless of what might have been, the truth now is that Hubbard is attracting unfavorable attention all over this region. What are we going to do-about it? We wish we knew, . . .</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">3. Then on the following Saturday, in July, . there suddenly appeared over Hubbard a green airplane and 5,000 folders entitled “Catholic Action at Work” fluttered down to th$ consternation of Hubbard residents who eagerly picked up the folders. Excerpts from this folder are:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Forged by the late Ambrose Ratti, Catholic Action is rapidly becoming the prong upon which the. Hierarchy intends to impale all who dare differ with her teachings and her political ambitions, / Past-masters in the use of force, threats, coercion,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">OCTOBER 18, 1939 </span><span class="font8">and at instigating mob-violence, they are stooping to conquer the world, and, wherever mob-action and threats of boycott are used against the free exercise of speech and discussion, you can always detect the slimy hands of that wicked politicoreligious foreign power, especially when in such mob-action you notice the use of rotten fruits, vegetables and eggs. Does not the Lord say: “By their fruits ye shall know them”? . . .</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">4. A suit was filed in Warren, county seat of Trumbull county, asking a restrainer.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Then, a temporary injunction was granted, the first of its kind in our work! On Saturday afternoon the witnesses walked, and the police had to let them do it. They were supposed to protect us, but they didn’t do a thing. Rotten tomatoes and eggs spoiled many a suit and dress, but the witnesses went on. One witness was attacked by eight hoodlums, who robbed him of his camera and valuable papers. (A suit against the police for $5,000 is pending.) The police refused to arrest the culprits and to make an attempt to retrieve the camera. Another witness was set on fire. Others were</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The next day, while we were gathering at the hall, a number of rowdies gathered, with the intent to make us “kiss the flag”. A whispering campaign had been conducted against Jehovah’s witnesses with the intent to make people believe that we are against the flag. When the writer observed the gathering of a huge ugly mob, he ordered that four huge flags be put across the outside windows of our hall. The effect was instantaneous. The mob dispersed and didn’t know what to think of it. Our reasoning is, Jehovah's witnesses are about the only people that truly stand for what the American flag stands for. We believe in the principles for which it stands. Just because we will not take off our hats to it, or make obeisance to it, does not mean that we don’t stand for what it stands for!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then for the trial in Warren. For a whole day we presented witnesses. The outcome, a decision which has not been understood by either side up to this very day. The fight goes on. .</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">All the time the newspapers of the Valley featured big headlined articles in our favor.

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">♦ Mussolini calls the Mediterranean sea “Mare Nostrum”, meaning “Our Sea”, but it is hardly that. The British have advantageous positions at Gibraltar, Malta and Cyprus, all fortified. France also has an interest in the sea, and, of course, so have Spain, Turkey and Greece. As a matter of fact, the Netherlands also lias an interest in it, for it is a way to her East Indian colonies, and therefore as much a “life-line of empire” to her as to the British. Just now the Mediterranean is a nest of cruisers, battleships, destroyers, torpedo boats and submarines. Italy and Germany have 273 of these peaceable contraptions there, while France and England, just to be safe, have 151 of them handy. Great Britain is seeking the aid of Turkey to keep peace in the eastern Mediterranean, and is also trying to line up Egypt, Persia, Iraq, Arabia and Afghanistan on the side of the Anglo-French peace front, also called the anti-aggression alignment. But it is one thing to get them lined up and another to keep them that. way. The Mediterranean, around which most of these peoples live, is a natural danger zone, and is called the graveyard of brave men.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>Mussolini Loves to Kill</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Writing in the French journal </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">La Lumiere </span><span class="font8">the Italian writer G. A. Borgese tells of Mussolini’s entry into the World War. It was at a quiet sector, and a certain understanding had been reached by the belligerents, who were entrenched but a short distance from each other. Rifle-firing and grenade-throwing were exchanged only at certain periods. When Mussolini, then editor of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Popolo d’Italia, </span><span class="font8">arrived he was angry at the relatively peaceful conditions, and scarcely had an enemy soldier lit a match in the evening than he threw a hand grenade in his direction, killing two men. His captain asked, “Why did you do that? They had done you no harm and were perhaps just taking a smoke and talking about their families. You have no heart.” But Mussolini was greatly pleased the next day to learn that his one grenade had killed two men and injured five; and from that time onward there were no more truces between the Italians and Austrians in that sector, and revictualing of the troops was effected only at the cost of daily losses of men.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ Signor Gayda’s mind wanders when he condemns America for criticizing Italian occupation of Albania. The particular point at which it wanders is when Gay-da said that America is not protected by distance. Maybe so; maybe so; but what about, the cops? It for Italy to start to invade the United States and have the whole thing break up because somebody got nervous and Called up the police headquarters. That actually happened in Staten Island in the early days of Fascism.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>In Less than Four Years</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">♦ In less than four years from the time Mussolini said that the independence of Austria was a principle that Italy would strenuously defend, he explained why Italy did not help Austria maintain its independence by saying that. Italy had never assumed any obligation to do so, either direct or indirect, either oral or written. How that boy ean lie!. y .</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark68"></a>Mussolini's Appeal to Force</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Wo desire that nothing more shall be heard of brotherhood, of sisterhood, of cousinhood, or other bastard relations, because the relations between States are relations of force, and these relations of force are the determining elements of our policy. The order of the day is this.—more guns, more ships, more aeroplanes, at whatever cost and by whatever means, even if we have to wipe out completely what is called civilian life. When you are strong you become dear to your friends and you are feared by your enemies.—From Mussolini’s address on the twentieth anniversary of his sleeping-car ride to Rome.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>Hitler’s Policy in Italy</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Italy pursuing Hitler’s policy, publishers in that country may still print books written by Italian Jews but may not sell them through booksellers. If they sell them at all they must sell them themselves. Without provocation on his part the Rome correspondent of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, wdio had been stationed<sup>1</sup> in Rome for the past fourteen years, was notified that he must leave Italy within eight days.

<p><span class="font8">♦ Aping Germany Mussolini, some days prior to March 11, 1939, expelled hundreds of Jews from Italy. Tbe poor creatures, including women, children and old men, spent several days in the mountains, nearly dying of hunger and cold. Some lost their shoes in the snow, 200 finally were given hospital care in Mentone, France, while 150 were admitted to hospitals in Monte Carlo. Thousands were reported within sight of France, knee-deep in the snow in the passes, denied admittance to France and unable to turn back to Italy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ Uneasy lies Goliath’s head on his shoulders. Two Italians in a single month recently made attempts to kill Mussolini, but. the Devil spared his life, for he has much yet to do, no doubt. A more serious matter was when a group of Italian veteran foot-raeers from Brihuega, Spain, wrecked the headquarters of the Fascist Union in Naples, because, after being tricked into fighting (or running away from it) in Spain, they got back to Italy and found themselves with no jobs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ Further details about the Libyan farms are that there is an artesian well on each farm and the settlers on arriving find food in the house, tools in the sheds, two horses and eight to twelve cattle in the stables, chickens and pigs. At first the farmers receive a subsidy from the government. This is gradually reduced, then rent is paid for a time, and afterwards the farms become the property of the settlers.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>Italian Munition Factories</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">♦ In his address to the Italian senate Mussolini drmv attention to the fact that Italy has 30,000 airmen, 876 factories turning out war material, and 580,033 hands working uninterruptedly in them. This was said at a time when Italy was technically at peace with Spain and was one of the powers guaranteeing non-intervention, but was using all its pow'ers to destroy another government.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark81"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark82"></a>Mussolini “Hit and Kan”</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Cornelius Vanderbilt told of a ride he took with Mussolini, with the Dime himself at the wheel. Tearing through the countryside the ear knocked down a child. Vanderbilt turned to see what had happened, but the Duce only stepped on the gas the harder, remarking, “Never look back, my friend, always forward.” Could any attitude toward his fellow man possibly be more cruel or selfish?</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark87"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark88"></a>Demons Ruining Mussolini</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">♦ According to information from Rome in the English </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">News Review,</span><span class="font8"> January 13, 1939, the health of Mussolini during the last months has been shaken to an alarming point. According to the same information II Duce suffers from periodical manifestations of a very strong neurotic exhaustion, being obsessed also by mystic musings. It was noted also that the orders given by him are. contradicting each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is said that the condition of II Duce is preoccupying particularly the royal circles. The king, Victor Emmanuel, began in these last times to show particular interest in the acts of Mussolini; and the crown prince, Umberto, is giving close attention to all the affairs of the country, that he might be ready in a given time to take personal control of the country.-—Kathemerine.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ In 1923 Mussolini personally decorated Philip Henry' Bernstein, a 62-year-old dramatic author of French birth and Jewish ancestry, with the insignia of the Order of Saint Maurice and Lazare.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Secret Promise to Italy</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">♦ The secret treaty with Italy, made in London in 1915 (see Judge Rutherford’s book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies,</span><span class="font8"> top of page 269) by Italy on the one hand and by France, Great Britain and Russia on,the other, to give Italy possession of the South Tyrol of Austria, Trieste (Austria’s busiest.port), certain islands in the Adriatic sea, the Dodecanese islands, and possessions in Eritrea, Somaliland and Libya in Africa, was never intended to be kept, but constituted a bribe to Italy to forsake its German-Austrian alliance. It is these old promises, made but never kept, that have much to do with Italy’s present claims and warlike attitude toward the nations that made the promises. Those familiar with the news in 1915 well remember that at that time Italy was for sale to the highest bidder.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Little Coffee for Italians</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">♦ All good Italian Fascists have been instructed to cut down their coffee drinking to the minimum, or leave it out altogether. The object is to put pressure on coffee-producing countries that are not disposed to garter it for Italian manufactured goods. The Ethiopian crop is still very inadequate for Italian needs.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">♦ Bela Imredy, after the fashion of Hitler and Mussolini, championed measures calculated to put the Jews of Hungary under the same disabilities that they suffer in Germany and Italy. Then the historians got to work and discovered that Imrcdy’s own great-grandfather, and also his own grandmother, on his mother’s side, were Jews. So Imredy resigned as premier of Hungary. Now if some historian would discover that both Hitler and Mussolini-had Jewish forebears, what a joke it W'ould be! Anyway,- it served Imredy right, The new premier of Hungary, Count Teleki, is a Roman Catholic, of course. And he might be part Jew, also.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ Italy is in process of putting its entire population in uniform. This already applies to the civil servants, whose summer and wdnter uniforms, designed by the state, must be worn when at work. The theory is that all are servants of the state and must dress like servants.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ It is illegal for advertisements of lotteries to pass through the United States mails, yet the Italian government now sends mail into the U.S.A, the cancellation stamps of which bear the legend, in Italian, “Invest in the Italian lottery and become a millionaire.”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark101"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark102"></a>Looking for Trouble</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Looking for trouble, and sure to get it, Italy is building the largest submarine fleet ever under one flag, and the most heavily armed, some of . them having 14 tubes. The new- submarines will be able to cross and reeross the Atlantic without refueling.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ Mussolini is having a hard time pacing his bills and, in November last, levied a capital tax of 74 percent on all partnerships and private companies with gross earnings of $526.50 annually. Looks like small pickings, does it not?</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦' Mussolini, issued a </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">new </span><span class="font8">“ten commandments” to his soldiers, all in general accord with the last one of the number, which succinctly said, “Mussolini is always right.” Just take a moment to compare that spirit with the one who modestly said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Why calle st thou me good ? -there is none good but one, that is, God.”—Matthew 19:17.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark109"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark110"></a>Use of Electricity</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">♦ In the use of electricity Italy is one of the most up-to-the-minute countries in the world. One may go the whole length of Italy, 905 miles (the distance from New York to Chicago by the Pennsylvania lines) by electric train, and at speeds up to 72 miles an hour. By the use of hydroelectric power resources Italy saves 1,300,000 tons of coal annually.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark111"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark112"></a>How About This?</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">♦ A quondam friend writes that the emblem of Fascism is a bundle of rods' enclosing an axe; that anybody who does not line up is first beaten with the rods and is then finished with the axe. He wants to know if that is right. Yes, that is right, that is, if anything as wrong as thht can be right, and be left to tell it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Fighting for Liberty in Hubbard, Ohio </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 19)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">came. Enthusiastically they adopted a resolution, prepared by the president of the Society, shown in cut on page 19. A mighty shout of “Aye” made known their affirmation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The battle rages on, without letup or compromise. The pickets are intact, and another folder, which is shown in facsimile on pages 18 and 19, has been printed, and 120,000 copies are being distributed all over the zone. Forty-two lawsuits are pending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And yesterday our petition to the governor of this state in impeachment proceedings against the mayor and the marshal of Hubbard was fyed, and thus this fight will come before the highest authority of the state, where it is expected a great witness will be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Ip our latest pamphlet we requested the people to write to three persons in Hubbard letters of protest. Although this pamphlet is out only since last Sunday, we are informed that thousands have already been received in Hubbard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Laconically, the wires of the United Press brought the following message to Youngstown, Ohio, this afternoon: “Pearl Loveless petitions Governor Bricker to remove R. C. Bowers, mayor of Hubbard, and Marshal Earl Greer, Hubbard, from office on the charges of mal-feasance, non-feasance and mis-feasance in office.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thus begins a battle in the highest place in Ohio. During the interim we have not been idle, but have worked day and night, to get all points involved backed up by fact. We have several investigators at work. Am going to take an active part in the preparation and in the conduct of both trials, with one single intent, to give the biggest witness possible and to exalt throughout these trials the name of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">our </span><span class="font8">great God Jehovah. Am going to watch that angle more than anything else, for this must come before kings and governors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One fact is already outstanding beyond doubt. A tremendous witness has been given throughout northeastern Ohio. The truth, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font8">the valiant fight of the Lord’s people in Hub* bard, have become the talk of all, young </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font8">old. The Lord’s name has been exalted far </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font8">wide, and that fact has imbued all the friends here to high pitch of enthusiasm and joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is only nine months since 384 publishers covered this entire zone. But August, when we actually had the most of our trouble in Hubbard, revealed the publisher's truly inspired by the Lord of hosts and they exerted themselves in an unbelievable manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The report, to prove that this fight has done much for the various local units around here, for the month of August was: 1,780 books, 19,481 booklets; the number of publishers shot all the way up to 938; these publishers put in 22,092 hours; the entire zone averaged 23.5 hours. What a glorious bout! Praise be to the Lord, who turns the darts of the enemy into mighty boomerangs, smiting the enemy with blasts of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One could go on with details, wonderful details, wonderful incidents, experiences of one and a hundred, from all parts of the zone, but it all amounts to one inevitable conclusion: “The battle is God’s.” Thrilling conclusion ! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The investigators report the receipt of 3,459 letters up to this afternoon by Hubbard officials. It’s only the fourth day since the appeal folder distribution began, and 45,000 have been distributed up to now; the other 65,000 are just coming off the press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All of this is creating quite a witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Our folder distribution has served one important end: it has prevented other towns, which had a mind to, from starting similai' trouble. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ In the little town of Elkhart, Iowa, some time ago we were running the &quot;Exposed’&quot; series of lectures by Judge Rutherford when a certain man with his collar in reverse (to show that he is what, the Scriptures style him—Isaiah 56:10, 11) came along and said peremptorily, “Turn that thing off.’&quot; I said, “Who are you, to give me orders? I am taking no orders from you, but if you listen you may learn something.” He reiterated, “I told you to turn that off,” and was then invited to be on his way, as there were others who were interested. He went away, threatening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Come Tuesday, we arrived on time, started the lectures, and after about ten minutes four saints of the “dog’s” flock came Up and demanded that the thing be turned off..Each was asked to give his name, which, with true Roman Catholic cowardice, was refused. They were then told that if they would listen quietly they would learn something, but one re</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">OCTOBER 18, 1939 </span><span class="font8">plied that they were good Catholics, and listened to their priest on Sunday and did not intend to listen to Judge Rutherford on Tuesday. Then those nice brave men began to rotten-egg the car, the personnel of which consisted of two women and one 80-year-old man, an old sea captain, who had been all over the world, and had many interesting experiences but said he had never seen anything in his whole life like his experience with these dogs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was a hot evening, the windows were open, and in no time we were a mess. We telephoned the police for protection. This was at 7:20 and the police arrived at 11:30. The next day it took three of us four hours to clean the car, and for a long time after that, on a hot day it smelled like a chicken coop. The original dog was out of town that night, but the younger pups from the same litter did the dirty work as well as he could have done it himself.—Martha Holmes, Iowa.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">- ♦ A pioneer at New York Convention had embroidered on the back of his white linen coat the words: “Serve Jehovah God and Christ the King. Hear Judge Rutherford.” Asked, “Why do you wear that garb? You are not oh strike,” the pioneer replied, “Oh, yes, I am. I am on strike against the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A pioneer from Oregon, 65 years of age, started for the convention the middle of April. Having no cash.to pay for fare, she washed dishes for necessary food and bed, thumbing her way from point to point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A Montreal pioneer was sent to jail for five days. On entering she was met by nuns who told her she must get down on her knees and confess. She refused, saying she confessed to Jehovah alone. She therefore received special punishment from the ones in charge of the Bug Warren where she was incarcerated. When she emerged she had been almost literally eaten alive by bugs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Up until 1882 the Japanese government regarded all religion as useless, but then began to revive Shinto shrine worship, though declaring it not religious. In October, 1901, the Japanese Supreme Court rendered a decision that State Shin to w religious. Of late the government has outlined the prayers that are to be offered at such shrines. They are: For a year without storms or floods; that the crops may be good; that the country may be prosperous; that the evil spirits may be kept from the priests. With the spread of the determination of the Japanese military authorities to dominate the entire world, Shinto worship was extended to such countries as have already been conquered, with the result that in Korea, at the Presbyterian General Assembly, the Japanese police ordered every delegate not to oppose Shinto worship, prevented known anti-Shinto-worshipcrs from attending, ordered missionaries to sign statements that they would not oppose Shinto-worship, and forcibly prevented them from speaking against it, by actually sitting on tile platform, so that they could control every statement made. Hero, is an illustration of Simon-pure idolatry—the totalitarian State worshiping itself and demanding that everybody else comply with its decrees, Korean Christians are up against it, and no mistake; and the idolatry they are fighting will spread to earth’s remotest bounds, finding expression in one land in one way, and in another land in yet another way.

<h6><a name="bookmark141"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark142"></a>“Vipers” in the Orkneys .</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">• Two sisters, enthused with the desire to spread the knowledge of the present establishment of the kingdom of God, and earnestly desiring to obey the commandment to preach the gospel of the Kingdom, went from the mainland of Scotland, to the Orkney islands. Their zeal in visiting the people in their homes resulted in placing with them a very considerable number of books and booklets which enable readers to read the Scriptures with underhanding without need of a preacher, who would only tell them what his church says is to be believed. The religionists in the islands are very vexed that the people should be able to get an understanding of the truth about the kingdom of God in this way, especially as their dogmas and the whole system of organized religion, under whatever name it is known, are shown to be contrary to the words and spirit of the teaching of Christ and the apostles. The religionists got busy with letters in the local newspaper, warning the islanders against the women and their books and the “dangerous” teaching. The Plymouth Brethren, who reckon to separate themselves from organized religion, had a try at putting up a barrage, and the 'reverend’ representative of the church of Scotland shot some of his dogmatic ammunition and, having gathered some mud from his church’s stores, endeavored to hinder the message of truth by besmirching the life of C. T. Russell, and the sincerity of Judge Rutherford in his service to the honor of God’s holy name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Plymouth Brethren have ever been bitter opponents of the.truth and of those whonpGod pleased to use in its service. They got light from the Scriptures to discern that the church organizations were entirely wrong; but they retained the defiling doctrines of the churches. They are very orthodox, being believers in the “Trinity” doctrine, and the unscriptural doctrine of “the immortality of the soul”, and they have hugged to themselves the blasphemous dogma of “eternal torment”. Through their publishing houses they have issued venomous attacks and continue to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Reverend” Alex. Burnett of the Old Manse,, -the local representative of the ehurch of Scotland (Presbyterian), writes to the local paper saying it is his duty to warn the public against the literature placed by the witnesses of Jehovah, and hopes that some evidence of what he styles its “pernicious character” which he relates will keep his people from reading what they have got and others from taking any. His evidence is the same vicious perversions which have had to serve these men for so long a time, except that he professes to add a personal experience, to give weight. His own bit is a reference to the South African trouble raised by natives in an endeavor to get back their freedom from “white” bondage. Part of the agitation which troubled the authorities was of a religious cast in which the name “Watch Tower” was used. That movement was entirely unrelated to the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society’s work in South Africa; but the likeness in the name served the clergy missionaries in their endeavor to brand the Society as an evil influence, and its literature as seditious. “Reverend” Burnett says he can add his testimony, claiming to speak from personal knowledge. He cannot have knowledge of any association of the representatives ' of Jehovah’s witnesses, who carry the writings, the warnings and exposition of the Bible by Judge Rutherford, and the native movement, for there was no connection. “Reverend” Burnett’s church, the church of Scotland, managed to get one of their foremost missionaries on the Royal Commission sent out to inquire into the labor troubles in the copper mines in North Rhodesia, and a great endeavor was made by this biased mind to link Judge Rutherford’s writings with the labor agitation. It could not be done. Later this same missionary agitation resulted in a case being tried in the High Court of South Africa, taken there by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, and that court declared after examination that there was not the slightest ground for the charge of sedition, but that the publications were expositions of the Scriptures and conformed thereto. If the “reverend” gentleman is as conversant with these things as he professes to be, he knows that he hides or perverts the facts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But this preacher of the gospel according to the. ehurch of Scotland’s dogma got aid iii his reviling. The Home Board of the church of Scotland, stung by the truth which goes to the homes of the people in all Scotland as elsewhere, has published a folder for the use of such as “reverend” Burnett, and hopes thereby to counteract the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. The folder is a scurrilous thing. They have joined the &quot;Roman Catholics and the Plymouth Brethren in their methods of vilification. Headed in bold red letters “Riches from Religion” the folder has about 26 paragraphs intended to expose the fraudulent men and methods (as they say) of the “new religion” now represented by Judge Rutherford. It ends with its computation that Judge Rutherford’s writing “must have brought in one year the comfortable income of £180,000”. In nearly all of the paragraphs there is a direct lie; all of them are perversions, and the whole is a scandalous thing for a church with so much pride of righteousness as the church of Scotland to allow its home board to publish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But Presbyterian parsons have long been bitter opponents of the witness to the establishment of the Kingdom, and of its messengers, now universally known as Jehovah’s witnesses. It was the Presbyterians of Canada, emigrants and the children of emigrants from Scotland, who were instigators of the opposition to Pastor Russell, and were so afraid of the truth that they got their government to forbid his entrance into Canada to preach the gospel. It was they that tried to get the officials in East Africa to ban the publications which carried the truth and to expel its messengers. Modern Presbyterianism gives its ministers a good deal of latitude, apparently asking little more than general conformation to the authority of its General Assemblies, and always with the maintenance of the church system. Its ministers are unbelievers in the Scriptures as the word of God, and, in fact, they have been in the van of rejectors of their inspiration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Opposition to the truth which exposes the religious systems of “Christendom” is to be expected; for it threatens their' inheritance. It is not a cause for astonishment that they act as they do: they are not honest to their own ordination vows, and can hardly be expected to be honest towards the truth. Let it be said once again that, so far from being money-makers out of their service for God, Pastor Russell died a poor man in the most literal sense, and Judge Rutherford-does not gain a penny- piece for himself out of the millions of books which are placed by Jehovah’s witnesses with the people. This work of preaching the gospel of the Kingdom is the</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">continuation of that which was begun by the Lord and His apostles, and is that of which He spoke in His prophecy of “the end of the world”, and the religionists are actingtowards this preaching of the gospel of the Kingdom as the Jews acted then. The words of Jesus as recorded at Matthew 12:34 is still a living word. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark143"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark144"></a>Like a Hammer</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">• ‘Is not my word like a hammer that break-eth the rock in pieces? saith Jehovah.’—Jeremiah 23:29, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The religionists of Jeremiah’s day had so hardened themselves against any opposition to the place in the nation which they had made for themselves, and w'ere so self-righteous, that when God, whom they professed to adore, sent Jeremiah to warn them of the impending destruction, He told His servant that these people werd as a rock, but that His word by Jeremiah would be a hammer by which the roek would be broken. Jehovah broke in pieces that religious rock, by His word, and by sending Nebuchadnezzar to waste Jerusalem. The religionists lost the glory and power they had made and taken for themselves, and their lives also, in that destruction. For a long time thereafter the worship of God was free from the hypocrisy, formalities and pretenses which had caused Jehovah to sweep His land clean. But the people again allowed this priestly, clergy class to fasten themselves in authority and power, and in the days of Jesus this sin against God came to its worst, and He was killed by them, because He spoke the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But the word of God by Jeremiah remains a word for this day, when that which was seen in Israel in Jeremiah’s day, and in Jewry in the days of Jesus, is now manifested in all “Christendom” and in all the sections of religionists. Religionists hide their head behind the shadow of their own infidelity: they refuse to believe that God has spoken in this day by His prophets. The Roman Catholic church professes to accept the Scriptures and to be their custodian ; but it will not allow any message to come from the Word of God, and as a church it pays no attention to the prophets, except to use a wqrd taken here or there which is made to support their institution. Most of the other sections of religion are frank in their rejection of the words of the prophets as being the word of God. But all of them are set in their place and purpose to maintain what they have; and again the word is true, ‘Is not my word like a hammer that breaketh in pieces ? saith the Lord-’ . ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Religionists set themselves against anything that is unorthodox, whether as to doctrine or what is not of their many and varied sections, One and all are agreed against the witness which God is giving and for some years has given against religion and to the fact of the establishment of His kingdom in this the day of His judgment. The books and booklets which Jehovah has caused to be written are carried abroad through the earth by His witnesses. They convey the message of the prophets, and proclaim the gospel of the kingdom of God, as well as the warning of the impending destruction both of religion and of everything else that is opposed to God and His kingdom. They are as God’s hammer to break the rock, Judge Rutherford, whom God has used to His purpose in this, is as hated by some as was Jeremiah, and for the, same reason.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark145"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark146"></a>■ The War</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">• For some time the dark war clouds’hung very low. Whether the lightning and the thunder of bombs and guns would break from them, or there would be some wind of peace to carry them away for a time, depended upon the perverseness of Hitler's mind, or on how he was impelled by the evil spirits which move it. It cannot be said that though the dreaded thing was'apparently so near as to be almost impossible it should pass that the people were in anywise panicky. The Government got its Emergency Powers Bill through Parliament, and, now that war has come, it takes the control of the national resources, and acts, as it must, like the dictator rulers. What has emerged in a clearer manner than ever before is that duplicity and lying go hand in hand with what are called “power.polities”. It does seem that the world is hastening fast to the condition of the days before the Flood, of which it is said “the earth was filled with violence”.—Genesis 6; II.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Vatican has been very busy in European politics, but the pope must have had a rather bad shock when the news of the pact between Hitler and Stalin was published. (This is not a pact between the German and Russian peoples—they are hut pawns in the political game.) The pope has apparently wrought hard to keep Communist Russia behind its own borders, hoping that Catholic Poland would prove a strong barrier against the Catholic’s bogy, Communism; but his chief partner id that purpose has made a bargain with the enemy. Franco, too, must have pulled a wry face when his former aide in delivering Catholic Spain from the terrible “'reds” went over to the enemy. One may comment that neither the pope nor Hitler is burdened with any particular care about Communism, as such: both have ulterior purposes in mind; both seek mainly after power, and take the means to advance their interests as circumstances give the opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Bank of England moved much of its business into the country, and the Bankers’ Clearing House, and other institutions are doing the same. Public buildings are protected against air raids, with heavy sandbag covering for the walls in case of near-by explosiqps, and in every way, as far as seems possible, there is preparation for the dreaded breaking out of the terrible thing which will mean the destruction of life and property and, it may confidently be predicted, of all that men hold dear. One thing is certain, namely, that there will be no settlement in the world till the time of trouble has done its full work and Jesus’ great prophecy as recorded in Matthew 24 has been fulfilled.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark147"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark148"></a>Kendal, Westmorland</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">• A recent issue of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font8"> carried a paragraph which said that the chief constable of Kendal had instructed the managers of the local cinemas to keep the doors of the cinemas closed at the end of the shows so as to ensure that the audience should not disperse while the few bars of the national anthem were played. The report was sent direct to the editor in Brooklyn by a local correspondent. It was incorrect, as inquiry reveals; was based on rumor and imagination. The police gave no such instruction, and the chief constable was injio way involved. We regret any inconvenience that may have been caused to the chief constable.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark149"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark150"></a>Commonwealth Stands by Britain</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">• A single dispatch from London tells that Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, Palestine, India, Tanganyika, Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, Jamaica, Bahamas, Bermuda, British Guiana, Falklands, Sierra Leone, Malta, Tonga and Basutoland unqualifiedly took their stand with Britain in the war against Hitler. The only exceptions were Southern Ireland and an ineffective resistance in Quebec.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark151"></a>Checking Up on a Jesuit</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Checking Up on a Jesuit</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">H It’s all right being a Jesuit, and A' f s? telling any kind of whopper, until Jjwk <sub>S()nlc</sub> courageous and inquisitive * person checks up, and then there is trouble. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Telegraph Register</span><span class="font8"> had a nice column story entitled “Jesuit s Work Removes Black Hole of Death”. In pathetic and eloquent phrase it told how “a kind-hearted Jesuit priest” couldn’t stand it to see the awful slums in which San Antonio’s Spanish-American people live, how he had taken the matter up with city authorities and then with Washington, and as a result of his efforts $10,000,000 would be expended in</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">-clearing and better-housing project.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Also, the story, which bore a San Antonio date liner-contained this convincing statement :</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The situation was desperate. Father Tranche.se set up the Catholic Relief organization, opened food depots throughout the district, fought starvation with bread and other food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It all sounded so good for the Jesuits that the matter was referred to a San Antonio attorney for the facts. He interviewed “Father” Tranehese himself, and asked him the direct question, “Who was responsible for getting that housing authority down here; was it the Junior Chamber of Commerce?” and “Father” Tranehese replied, “It was Maury Maverick and the Junior Chamber of Commerce.” This statement was and As the truth, and this is well known to everybody in San Antonio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And now about the rescue from famine. The attorney investigated this and discovered that —</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">the only depot established by Tranehese </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font8"> the district was at his ehurch house, and then he dished out only bread, stale bread, and thin soup and poor coffee, and this was only to his parishioners and did not approach to the smallest or slightest degree in reaching the mass of the pecan workers; that this was the only depot that he had anything to do with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Query: Who is it that is so anxious to put the work of this Jesuit priest in San Antonio in such a brilliant light before the readers of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph Register?</span><span class="font8"> And would you not think that even the shameless </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph Register</span><span class="font8"> would know better than to publish such a lot of lying drivel without investigation? One paragraph in the story reads as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">father Tranehese is a hard man to frighten. At last his detractors threatened him with death and then with worse. One man wrote: “I could start a story that there is a priest who writes love letters to young girls and gives jewels to women of his congregation.”</span></p>
