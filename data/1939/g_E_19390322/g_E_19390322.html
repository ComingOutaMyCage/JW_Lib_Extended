<div><img src="g_E_19390322_files/g_E_19390322-3.png" alt="" style="width:43pt;height:41pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuit organization, perceiving that in the Roman Catholic Church “saints” were highly esteemed, resolved to win for himself deathless </span><span class="font5">glory by excelling them all. That spirit dominates the Jesuit system to this day. “The Society of Jesus,” 'which is the name that Loyola and his followers appropriated^. to themselves as a distinctive designation, carries with it the suggestion that they, above all others, were the companions of Jesus, and is indicative of the claim they make both to superior sanctity and to sanctified superiority. At one time or another the Jesuits have been suppressed and banned in every country of Europe, only to succeed in returning and continuing their activities. They are now very active in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Referring to- the Jesuits the Milwaukee </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald^Citizen</span><span class="font5"> gives the following information: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Founded in 1534 by St. Ignatius Loyola (a Spaniard) in Paris, the Order was the chief instrument of the Catholic Reformation, Ite work did much to stop the progress made by the so-called Protestant Reformation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Reverend Father’<sup>1</sup> Robert I. Gannon, Jesuit president of Fordham University, in an address at Philadelphia, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Liberalism ia like a worn-out shoe which should he thrown away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The liberalism of the 19th century meant freedom to do as you please, but true liberty is freedom to do as you should. The old liberalism. is dead and gone, and we should be glad of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What he really meant was that the whole world should submit to the j pope of Rome (Pius XI), who himself confessed to a Jesuit and was guided by. Jesuit “counsel”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only is Jesuitism opposed to liberalism; it is definitely in favor of cooperation with Fascism. Indeed, it is practically certain that the Fascist program as represented in Italy, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">MARCH 22, 1639</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Germany, Spain and elsewhere is. the result of Jesuit intrigues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The editor of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Our Sunday Visitor</span><span class="font5"> states, “ . . . the Holy Father has not condemned Italian Fascism as such, and neither have we. We have often noted that it is conceivable that the Church, can get along with a totalitarian ruler if he grants the Church full liberty to carry on her work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The support of the Hierarchy and its chief representatives is definitely back of the Fascist program, as the following examples will clearly indicate.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Backing the Butcher</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font5">dispatch from Philadelphia states that at a mass meeting called by Denis Cardinal Dougherty for the purpose 4,000 persons pledged their support to Franco the Butcher and his heathen Moors in their efforts to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">de</span><span class="font5">stroy the government of the Spanish Republic, American volunteers in Spain were sneer-ingly referred to by Hierarchy leaders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Jesuit magazine misnamed </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“America” </span><span class="font5">stated that of the American volunteers </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">who </span><span class="font5">served the Spanish Republic in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">war against </span><span class="font5">it waged by the combined forces of Hitler, Mussolini, the pope, Franco and the Moors,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Most of the 3,200 Americans were Jewish and foreign-born riff-raff Americans: a small percentage were respectable citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Commenting on this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The New Republic </span><span class="font5">thinks the editors of “America” overplayed their hand, and questions both their sincerity and their truthfulness. Good!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Reverend Father” Francis X, Talbot, editor of the foregoing Roman Catholic weekly, wrote to President Roosevelt protesting because an <sup>;</sup>8,000-ton freighter sailed from the United States to Valencia, Spain, with foodstuffs, clothing and medical supplies. If the vessel had sailed to some port controlled by Franco the Butcher, and had been loaded to</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ . ' •&quot;' • &lt;&nbsp;■ the gunwales with munitions of war, would he have said anything? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ignatius W. Cox, of Fordham University, who is a Jesuit, is in ‘ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;favor of letting Loyalist Spain have</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the surplus foodstuffs of other na-.tions, provided the Roman pope is given charge of the distribution, so. that he may illustrate the words “Do good to those who hate you”—using the goods of others to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now, what do you suppose was going through the mind of “Reverend Father” Ignatius W.. Cox, when, in a magazine article entitled “Is Democracy Doomed?” he states, “There is little difference between Communism and a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">perverted</span><span class="font5"> form of Fascism.” Look for it, and in every Catholic article you will find the tell-tale adjective that was the objective in the first place. Mr. Cox is_ merely boosting Fascism, which is Catholic Action, and is trying to help his readers to put on the blinders and think that there is a good Fascism, which he represents, and a bad one which nobody represents. Fqr every sensible person knows that in Spain all kinds of Fascism, those of Hitler, Mussolini, Franco, and the pope, wprked together to destroy the Spanish Republic and put all that is left of Spain back under the iron heel of the Roman Hierarchy. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The only reason why the Jesuits favor Fascism and oppose Communism is that Fascism recognizes the Roman Hierarchy. In an address in Jersey City “Reverend Father?’ R. Rush Rankin, Jesuit, in answer to a question, stated he would -prefer Fascism to Communism. That stands to reason, but it is equally certain that the Jesuits and the Hierarchy would as readily co-operate with Communism as with Fascism, if that suited their purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">; In this connection it is of interest to mention that the Communist party of western Pennsylvania, though the Communists are condemned by both Jesuits and Hierarchy, came out in a manifesto in behalf of Pennsylvania’s Irish Catholic Lieutenant Governor Thomas Kennedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Meanwhile America is being subjected to constant anti - Communist propaganda by paeans of which the Jesuits hope to divert attention away from their own subversive activities. Numerous booklets are on display in Catholic churches and bookshops whooping up the “Communist” bogey. However, intelligent observers are not being fooled, as ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">is indicated by the following excerpt from an article by Aaron E. Carpenter, president of the Houghton Company, in “The Houghton Line-”: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The chief topic of discussion these day? at every patriotic society th which I. belong (and I belong to several) seems to .be the danger of Communism. Personally, I think we are in greater dagger of Fascism than of Communism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I have talked With laboring men all over the east and I have met very few Communists. We have had one in our own organization for twenty years. Politically he seems quite harmless. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the other hand, everybody who reads the papers today most realize the danger of Fascism and-the Totalitarian State in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore, I regret to say that in the past two years 'I have met many men of substantial means and education and with no little influence in their respective communities who are heartily in favor of the Fascist State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The United States has gotten along for over 160 years without either form of the totalitarian stdte, and in my opinion one form is almost as bad as the other and I think that many patriotic societies and people of means could spend Ihei^-time and &gt;&nbsp;money much better in trying to stamp out Fascism rather than Communism. :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I do-net-think there is one chance in a million that America will ever, go Communistic; but she could go Fascist; and Americans, want neither.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Major General George Van Horn Moseley,'in the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Journal and American, </span><span class="font5">stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We do not, have to vote for a dictatorship to have one jn America. The issue is not as clear-cut as that. We have merely to vote increased government responsibility for our individual lives, increased government authority over our daily habits, and the resultant Federal paternalism will. inevitably beecane dictatorship. For, when we make the government responsible for finding a living for all of us, that government must inevitably crack' down on talk of the more abundant life and shift the emphasis to the enforced duty of the worker to produce as a patriotic act—-to produce or be-liquidated. :</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Dissimulation a la Jesuit</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">The Catholic Press meanwhile tries to dissimulate in true Jesuit S j siyle by means of items to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">C J</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> «i 1 </span><span class="font5">tjj,, cptholm press is against any form of dictatorship in* this country, and therefore delighted with the defeat of President Roosevelt’s Supreme Court packing and reorganization hill; but before 1,200 Roman Catholic- firemen in Brooklyn the “Reverend Father” Duffy defended Germany^ Italy and Japan and denounced the Spanish Republic. That, however, is not news. It is news, however, when a “Reverend Father” defends the Spanish people rather than their traducers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. Halford E. Luceock, of Yale Divinity Sehool, in an address in New York city, observes that—</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Fascism comes to America, and it has already come in some parts, it will not be marked with the swastika and labeled “Made in Germany”. It will not even he called Fascism, but will be called by that high-sounding- and highly praised name “Americanism”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">John T. Metcalfe, one of the Dies committee investigators, listed twenty-four Fascist organizations in the United States, and it is significant that seventeen of the twenty-four have the word “America” or “American” as part of the title of the unAmerican outfit the base of which is opposition to the principles of democracy whiejj have made America a nation of intelligent, Libertyloving people.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19390322_files/g_E_19390322-4.png" alt="" style="width:200pt;height:245pt;">
<p><span class="font5">Condemned and deserted</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Franciscan, </span><span class="font5">Roman Catholic periodical, carried an article which regretted that “the Dies’ inquiry into un-American activities omitted one important ‘ism’ ”, the work of Jehovah’s witnesses,, which it dubs “Rutherfordism”. It resents the liberty exercised by these Christian workers in the dissemination of Bible truth, and their exposure of rackets, including the religious racket.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rather than enlighten the people </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Franciscan,</span><span class="font5"> together with the Jesuits and the Hierarchy, would drag them back to the superstitions of the Dark Ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">/T $50,000 of American taxpayers’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">L money goes toward the erection of , the statue of St. Francis of Assisi . <sup>on</sup> Christmas Tree Point, near San &quot;&nbsp;Francisco. This gent, to advertise his “humility”, once actually rolled in the</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">gle confront you. Let’s face courage. Do not be afraid. Once</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">mud with swine. But this was nothing compared to the moral mud in which the Franciscan monks rolled in Germany. Readers will recall that, in the summer of 1D3G, out of about 500 Franciscan (St. Francis of Assisi) monks in Westphalia 276 were convicted by fellow Catholics on charges of sodomy and 61 others confessed their guilt by fleeing across the border. Just then Pope Pius XI suppressed the order in that vicinity. It is now a good time to do something to build up a reputation for that old freak and the miscreants -who revere him, and to get stupid Uncle Sam to foot the bill. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Ready for Action</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">It appears evident that the Jesuit program is not merely an educational one, as is that of Jehovah’s witnesses, who would not take up arms for or against any worldly cause. On August 28, l!J38, at San Diego, Calif., only a month after the head of his church made the statement to which he has reference, the “Most Reverend” Chhrles Francis Buddy, bishop of San Diego, delivered himself of the following, in an address to Catholic Youth:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Days of sharp strug-it frankly and with when the Fascist</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">government would have hindered Catholic youth clubs, the pope said that whoever attacks Catholicism attacks him. And whoever attacks him dies. History proves this to be true. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pius IX, in an encyclical letter of August 15, 1854, said: “The absurd and erroneous doctrines or ravings in defense of liberty of conscience are a most pestilential error —a pest, of all others most to be dreaded in a state.” In a later encyclical he condemned those “who assert the liberty of conscience and of religious worship” and “all such as maintain that the church may not employ force”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">. Obviously the princi-pies of the Roman Cath-p &lt;&lt;&nbsp;olie system are diamet-rically opposed to the principles upon which the government of the United States was founded. This conflict of principles, although clearly evident, is probably not fully appreciated by the average Catholic, but is well understood by the Hierarchy and “the more intelligent of the laity”. This is shown in a statement made by Hilaire Belloc, the famous Catholic author, published in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Truth-Seeker </span><span class="font5">of October 1, 11)38:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“ . . . the</span><span class="font5"> necessary conflict between the civil state and the Catholic Church, where the two are not </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">identified,&quot;</span><span class="font5"> a conflict which has disturbed Europe for centuries, must still take place in the United Slates because the Catholic Church is in its root principles at issue with the civic definition both of freedom and of authority. For the purpose of the state, religion is cither a universally admitted system or a matter of individual choice. Hut by the definition which is the very soul of Catholicism, religion must be, for the Catholic, first a supreme authority superior to any claims of the state; secondly, a corporate thing and not an individual thing; thirdly, a thing dependent upon authority and not upon a persona! mood; fourthly, a guarantee of individual freedom in all that is not of faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Tn general that conflict [between the civil state and the Catholic Church] with which Europe is acquainted to the full and which has filled the history of two thousand years from the time of Nero to our own, is inevitable. ... No one can know the United States without admitting that when the conflict shall then' arise, an equilibrium will not be established or preserved, for the conflict will lie novel and will seem monstrous. . . . The chief political problem presented by religion has, then, still to be solved in the New World. . . . Presented the problem certainly will be, and in one or other of the many fashions, stable or unstable. more or less tragic, it will have to be solved. . . . The new and separate spirit which has made America, which created a spiritual condition peculiar to that continent, may produce, perhaps will soon produce, at any rate tends to produce, some quite unique experiment in the field of religion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Meanwhile the Hierarchy is extending its influence and exerting its power , in every direction, obtaining favors, concessions and privileges the granting of which is more or less in violation of the Constitution of the United States and the principles of democracy and freedom. A few scattered examples will serve to illustrate this point.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Favors to Catholics</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">February 15 Justice Gilbert V. Schenck of the State Supreme Court dismissed a petition brought by Joseph Wheless on behalf of the New York League for the Separation of Church and State to prevent the free use of the Chancellor's Hall in the State Education Building by the Roman Catholic Siena College for a lecture by a priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Attorney Wheless was successful in the Court of Appeals ease which ruled that the transportation of parochial school children at State cost was unconstitutional, the legislature at Albany adopted an amendment to make it constitutional.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With regard to the subject of transportation for parochial school pupils at Government expense, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Truth-Seeker</span><span class="font5"> remarked:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No one acquainted with the dogmas</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19390322_files/g_E_19390322-6.jpg" alt="" style="width:44pt;height:44pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">and policies of the Catholies will suppose that they will rest content with transportation at public expense of pupils of parochial schools. Next they will demand free text books, and then the payment by the State of the salaries of teachers in Catholic schools. They have so demanded in some of the States and came near winning lately in Ohio. Their partial victories will strengthen them in gaining full State support. Nor would they be content with that. The ultimate aim of Catholics is that their schools alone should be supported at public expense. Protestant schools in Catholic countries do not share in the public funds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The explanation of this undermining of the secular public school lies in the militancy of the Catholics and the lack of militancy of Protestants and the vast unchurched majority. The Catholics are well organized. They constitute a compact and cohesive minority. Their votes are controlled and deliverable to a greater degree than that of any other large group of citizens. To the big newspaper, the Catholic Church is the holiest of “sacred cows”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An advertisement of the Eucharistic Congress at New Orleans mentions the city as one—</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">where Sisters are transported free in street cars in gratefulness for their many labors for the city in the past, whore the Catholic faith is openly professed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1938, for the first time in history, the United States Government, through the District of Columbia Health Department, apportioned 20 physicians to look after the teeth and the general health of students in the parochial schools. This was arranged for the Roman Hierarchy by an act of Congress in the last session, in which the word “public” was omitted from before the word “schools”. The work of turning everything in the country over to the Roman Hierarchy proceeds apace.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>A $17,000 Gift</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">The city of Albany, always alert to please the Hierarchy, gave a Roman Catholic brotherhood a tract of land valued at $17,000, receiving in return the assurance that the land would be used for a school for Catholics. A certain taxpayer thought this was going too far, and instituted suit, being represented by Joseph Wheless, New York City attorney. As a result the deed giving the Roman Catholic brotherhood title to the land was declared void. The Catholic order entered an appeal to a higher court. They are not going to let $17,000 slip away as easily as all that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The implicit concession that Catholic education would be a sufficient consideration for the gift of a $17,000 tract of land to a Catholic organization is a dangerous precedent and is another step toward the complete undermining of the American public school system, which, whatever its faults, is to be preferred a thousand times to the kind of “education” envisaged by the Roman Hierarchy and exemplified in such countries as Italy and Spain, where illiteracy is the rule rather than the exception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That this danger is appreciated by educators and Americans generally is indicated by the alarm expressed by public-spirited citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The provision in the report of the President’s Advisory Committee on Education that part of the $855,000,000 Federal fund might be used by the states to furnish reading materials, transportation and scholarships for pupils in private (parochial) as well as public schools, brought a storm of protest from leading educators who instantly recognized it as a first step in the destruction of the American public school system. Among the opposers of the measure were Professor Jesse II. Newlon, of Teachers College, Columbia University, George S. Counts, professor of Education at the same institution, and Professor Jerome Davis, of Yale University, president of the American Federation of Teachers. The defense of the proposed measure came from Fred J. Kelly of the never-before-heard-of United States Office of Education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In his book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Home Stoops to Conquer,</span><span class="font5"> E. Boyd Barrett points out that, in effect, the Hierarchy “demands that she have the exclu-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MARCH 22, 1939 </span><span class="font5">sive right to decide when and where and how to erect schools (without any reference whatsoever to taxpayers) and that the taxpayer should be compelled to foot the bill. What in essence she demands is the imposition on non-Catholic citizens of the odious injustice of ‘taxation without representation’.”</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">In the debate at Atlantic City on the advice of the President’s Advisory Committee that millions of Federal funds lie used by the states in furnishing reading materials, transportation and scholarships for pupils in parochial and other private schools, Professor George D. Strayer, of Teachers College, Columbia University, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let’s not have any ehtireh. Catholic, Protestant or Jewish, using public money to make propaganda for any policy or belief peculiar to itself. Let all these churches stand on their own feet. Let them not use the arm of government through controlled education to enforce their religious and political philosophies. History shows the tragedy of church-State-controlled education. Let’s not have it repeated in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the same occasion an audience of 800 persons adopted with only nine dissenting votes a resolution by Professor Harold Hand, of Stanford University, condemning the proposal for Federal aid to non-publie schools as— a clear violation of the principle of separation of Church and State, therefore vicious and unAmerican.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The attitude of the Roman Hierarchy toward education is significant. It is expressed by its representatives in no ambiguous terms, as is evident from the following statement by “Reverend Father” Orestes Augustus Brownson, quoted with approval in his book on Catholic Schools by the “Reverend Father” James Aloysius Burns, late president of Notre Dame University ;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We deny, of course, as Catholics, the right of the civil government to educate, for education is a function of the spiritual society, as much so as the preaching and the administration of the sacraments; but wo do not deny to the state the right to establish and maintain public schools. ... It may found and endow schools and pay the teachers, but it cannot dictate or interfere with the education or discipline of the school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">* In view of the Hierarchy’s constant cry that it is being misrepresented and “insulted”, note should be taken of the fact that this is a statement by one of its outstanding proponents.—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This highly entertaining proposal, that the Hierarchy dictate the policy ^and the Government foot the bill is put forward in aH seriousness by a man who stands in the forefront of Catholic educational circles. But there js more, much more!</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Will Teach “Democracy”, and Bow!</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">Catholic leaders in the United States, in response to a call of the late Pius XI for defense of democratic government,, have inaugurated an educational program, ostensibly to train more than 3,000,000 Catholic pupils in &quot;enlightened, conscientious American citizenship”. The public schools are. not good enough for “democratic” instruction of the kind approved by the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the &gt;&nbsp;behest of the pope, U. S. bishops are rallying, so they say, to the defense of democratic government and are preparing to teach democracy in 10,000 Catholic schools, high-schools and colleges. What have they been teaching in these schools until now? Let a graduate of Duquesne University answer:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To protest at Duquesne University is futile. Petitions arc ignored, the student paper is silenced, and smooth words about the Reds are tossed around. This applies even to us Catholic students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are times, however, when even devout Catholics must cry out against the decrees of the university’s administration. Now is one of those times. For the administration has had the audacity to openly invite a Fascist ambassador of an Ethiopia-raping, Spain-bombing Italy to address this semester’s graduating class! In this time of anti-democracy, in this time when the church is being more and more identified with Italian Fascism, Duquesne University bends over backward and invites “his excellency, the Royal Italian Ambassador to the United States, Fulvio Suvich”, to give its graduates a final message for their role in the world. And I, for one, protest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I am a graduating student and a worker. My Catholic friends in both fields know the intellectual plight of the Italian student and the lingering misery of the Italian worker. And they don’t want those conditions in America. Shall Fulvio Suvieh tell us differently<sup>1</sup>? Or shall the administration at Duquesne tell us differently? Most likely yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We call on the Catholic Radical Alliance and other progressive Catholics, the American Legion and other patriotic, groups, to protest this open flirtation with Fascism by the administration at Duquesne University. To have Suvich tell us of democracy is similar to having Satan deliver a sermon on sin.—Duquesne Graduate, ’38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Roman Hierarchy’s proposal to teach “democracy” was treated in full in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> No. 504,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Catholic education is inseparably bound </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">up </span><span class="font5">with priestcraft, which.is the</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">smnmum bunum, </span><span class="font5">the chief good, of the Hierarchy system. Consider the following.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Over his own signature Kari J, ■ Alter, bishop of Toledo, Ohio, makes the statement :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">___</span><span class="font5"> It requires 20 years of continuous study'to prepare a priest for the altar; </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">If </span><span class="font5">he is to serve later on in a special capacity </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font5">a doctor of theology, philosophy, canon law or some educational office, then three years more of graduate study must be provided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Do you remember that place where Jesus said to His chosen twelve apostles, “Now go to some seminary and spend </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">23</span><span class="font5"> years .getting ready to do something and then go ye into ail the world and preach the gospel to every creature”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One would think, however, after all their education, the “learned” priests would know exactly where Cardinal Hayes went when he died. Bat note the confusion as indicated in newspapers, meanwhile remtunbering that newspapers seldom print anything concerning Catholicism that does not have the O.K. of some agent of the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The San Francisco </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font5"> had a,big headline “Cardinal Hayes Dead”. Then it had a lesser headline that he was in an “eternal sleep”; Then the next day Mr. Cieognani:cautiously stated that he could do more for his archdiocese in heaven than he could in New York. Then four days later thousands attended mass for the “repose of his soul” in “Purgatory”, Question: Where is Cardinal Hayes ?</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Sample of Catholic Education</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">Since actions speak louder; far louder, than mere words, their conclusion is that Cardinal Hayes went to “purgatory”—the cardinal who was called “the most spiritual man” and “the Cardinal of Charities” went to “purgatory”. Now consider the. following utterance of one of the learned priests aforementioned, as published'in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Register</span><span class="font5"> of November 15, 1936:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only docs the Roman Catechism accept the reality of fire in purgatory, but the Fathers of the Western Church defend its existence. St. Augustine, speaking of purgatory, remarks that “the fire in purgatory is more painful than anything-one can possibly suffer in this life”. So, too, in similar words of St. Ambrpse we read: “I judge the transitory fire of purgatory to be more intolerable than</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">weary tribulation in the present life”; and? it was </span><span class="font5">(St Thomas’ opinion that “the least pnin of purgatory exceeds the greatest pmiishment of this life”. Some commentators have interpreted the Scriptural reference to the fire element in purgatory as being a spiritual, fire, and Origen looked upon it as a mere figure of speech (De Principiis ii, 10), Despite these divergent opinions, we might well ' accept the salutary dictum of Cardinal Bellarmine that, “if there is no real fire, there will he something much more terrible, which God has prepared in order to demonstrate His power.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fascism here, “purgatory” hereafter, seems to be the basic formula of Roman Catholic education. A little less learning and a little more Bible information would stand the priests and educators of Rome in good stead. They are still eager to extend their “religious” education to the public schools of America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A report from Albany is that a special committee of the state, board of regents, consisting of Owen D. Young, Roland B. Woodward, Susan Brandeis, Thomas J. Mangan and William J. Wallen, will try to figure out some way of giving “religious” instruction to the school children of New York state. The whole scheme is illegal, as all these regents well know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But the Hierarchy practically controls New York state. It has repeatedly defeated in .the New York legislature the proposed Child Labor Amendment to the Constitu</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">tion. It is estimated that 83 percent of the citizens of New York state are for the amendment; but the Hierarchy has the politicians “by the snoot”, and so the will of the people is not considered. The Hierarchy’s opposition to the Child Labor legislation is based upon the flimsiest “reasons”. It professes to fear Federal control of children and their education, but its Teal reason is that relieving children from work in mines and factories would make it possible for4hem to improve their minds, which is something the Hierarchy does not want.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This calloused unconcern for the welfare of children, many of them Catholic, contrasts painfully with the following profession of love for the “Christ-ehild” who has since grown to manhood and been exalted to the rulership of the pniverse:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a Ruler he Could have had our respect, ad* miration, fear,, love'too, of a sort, but an aloof love, not the kind of love with tears and laughter </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">MARCH 22, </span><span class="font5">1SSS</span></p>

More than anything else, that is what Jesus wants from us, when we lift him out of Hia Christmas Crib and press Him to,our hearts; that joyous love which the heart outpours when we give it to a baby.—The Confraternity of the Precious Blood, Reverend Father Stedman, Director, 5300 Fort Hamilton Parkway, Brooklyn, N.Y.

<p><span class="font5">The Roman Hierarchy condemned the World . Youth Congress- recently held at Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, New York, and as soon as it was over did all they could to blacken its name. The Congress passed praiseworthy resolutions of fraternity of all men, condemnation of war, conscientious- refusal to kill, pressure for peaceful solutions, condemnation of bombardment of civilians, and appeals for arbitration, and these were signed by representatives of 47 nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bulgaria, Hungary, Iraq, Japan, Santo Do-/ mingo, Russia, Italy, Germany arid the Vatican City state did not sign, and do not want what the youth want, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Under a Rome-controlled government one.,-may expect courts to make rulings attempt- . ing to define what is worship or an act of worship and what is not. Obviously, when a court is privileged to make such a ruling, freedom of worship is at an end. It is tantamount to saying, “You may worship gs you please provided you accept the court’s' definition of what is worship.” An example of this tendency is furnished in the New York Court of Appeals’ opinion that school children can be enforced to salute the flag because it “is not an act of worship”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A comment on this decision, published in the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Herald-Tribune</span><span class="font5"> of January 22 (1939) is of interest here.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Vatican continues to claim for itself, temporal power, to proclaim its belief in the divine right of kings, and to make its concordats and protocols with monarchs and dictators. It would fain establish diplomatic relations even with the United States, and bargain with this, government, not for freedom of its members to worship according, to their beliefs, for that right is declared and protected, drat rather for some some </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">-form </span><span class="font5">of acknowledgment of its own authority over the souls and consciences of men. Such recognition is evidently beyond, the power of this government to give, and it seems clear that if could not consistently take any action which would recognise or admit such authority. So the Vatican finds itself </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">the anomalous position of accepting and taking full advantage of the freedom of worship which prevails in this country, and at the same time denying the truth of the principle on which that freedom is based.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">’Whether you call them &quot;movies”, “motion pictures” or “the cinema”, makes little difference to Rome, as long as she can control them sufficiently to eliminate things she does not want, and add such features as will glorify &quot;the church”.

<p><span class="font5">Hierarchy - Jesuit censorship of the press is more and more in evidence. As a result pictures of persons kissing cardinals’ rings, etc,, constantly appear in American papers, many of them seemingly posed for the benefit of the public. The idea seems to be to get Americans used to the idea and to break down their natural repugnance to such creature-worship. The ceremonies incident to the late pope’s demise were featured on a large scale, a vast propaganda.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The subservience of the press to special interests, including the Hierarchy, is manifested farther in the editorials, With respect* to this point, U.S. Senator Sherman Minton said:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The United Catholic Organizations’ Press Relations Committee, under Jesuit management, will allot the various editors of the United States to supervision with a view to still more effective control-of the news channels. As, a result, one may expect to see more and more of the propaganda which has been, shoved under the noses of liberty-loving Americans for the past decade or so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">New York newspapers 'sickened themselves and everybody else by claiming that Commodore Irviryft Presbyterian commander of the Queen Mary, looked at a St. Christopher medal, given him by a passenger, allegedly asked the medal if he could successfully deck his big ship without the aid of the striking tugboatmen, and was told in reply to go ahead. This whole nonsense, dictated by the Devil, .and exploited by Catholic newspapermen, could never have had any more foundation than mere joking on the part of Commodore Irving, but the suckers that believe the newspapers will take it all at 100 percent; and that the Roman Hierarchy knows well, and counts on it, to put its racket across.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">0 I </span><span class="font5">write you about a courageous police offi-ei£! herd in Saskatchewan, Canada.

' Each of these' towns also Has its own con</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">stable. One Sunday We had our sound ear set </span><span class="font5">up in a small town called Vonda and played the “Hypocrisy Exposed” records, When the last record was being played the town constable, doubtless instigated by . the clergy of the Roman, cult, suddenly appeared and ordered the operator to “get the hell out of the town”. But we calmly finished the lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After seeing that his bluff did not work, the constable got greatly enraged and went to get the mounted police to arrest us. The driver of the sound car also took that to the police barracks, to explain our mission, and arrived in time to hear an interesting colloquy between the police and the constable. The Devil overplayed his part. The mounted police here was a man worthy of his title and position, and believes in upholding law and order instead of submitting himself to the old singing harlot. He explained to the constable that we were within our rights,, and that no one might unlawfully interfere with our work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then the constable</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">undertook to bluff the mounted police, saying that he would get someone else to drive us out of town; but his bluff did not work. The mounted police became severe with him, giving _him most pointed and emphatic advice </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">that no </span><span class="font5">unlawful interference with our </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">work by </span><span class="font5">anybody whomsoever would be tolerated under any consideration. Seeing that his bluff had failed, the constable left the barracks in a hurry and disappeared. Then the mounted police said, “I guess the Catholics are afraid they are slipping.”—William Ellinoy, Saskatchewan.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">.Lord Lytton once said: “Discover what will destroy life, and you are a great man; what will prolong it, and you are an impostor.” Although some may think that the solution </span><span class="font5">of health or cancer topics should rightfully be monopolized by cliques of “members in good standing” of the American Medical Association, we Americans are awakening to the sordid fact that, as part and parcel of the cancer problem, we have a right to look into this question of monopoly in medical matters. While “cancer specialists” seek and obtain ever-in creasing funds plus legal restrictions and exclusive research privileges, they can and do use no small amount of fund and effort in the suppression and persecution of students in parallel fields of endeavor, to the general detriment of real progress and to the specific harm of the individual sufferers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When instead of killing cancer they kill the patient, they cry “Contamination” in the handling of the nostrum—serum. How can it be any different when this body is subject only to a self-appointed “committee of investigation” rather than to the irrefutably logical fact that serums and vaccines are products of contamination and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ipso facto</span><span class="font5"> their </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“essentia est contaminare”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Kant, the German philosopher, once said to his friend, a professor of medicine: “If a man reaching thirty years of age still believes in the beneficial action of medicines, he most certainly is an idiot.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Wilford Allen, Connecticut’s famous physician, for many years faculty member of New York Homeopathic Medical College, at the meeting of his profession in New Haven, Conn., made an emphatic statement, that rise in cancer is attributed to the use of serums.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. Sapir, of Yale University, once stressed that the treatment of the sick must be based on understanding him as an individual and that the basis of disease may be psychological.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sir W. A. Lane, England’s foremost physician, teaches a cancer-bewildered world how to live in order not to have cancer. Please tell me who is right, who is wrong.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">We are not concerned as to what one calls his nostrum, vaccine or serum, or what not; in truth, these are by-products of pus matter, which has been created in the flesh of some animal not able to defend itself, and after this has become a “scientific” utility and pronounced as “harmless” in theory. In reality and action it is worse than the proverbial “seven plagues”, because our scientific boys fail to identify and isolate their tragic phantom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This pus mixture, when injected into the blood-stream of the human body, remains dormant as long as vitality of the patient is maintained ; and if this happens to occur the world then hears the blare of scientific trumpets via pyrotechnics of free publicity, with the view of exploiting the afflicted in the interest of profit-mongers and high-pressure sale-houses, but never for the good of suffering humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And, the moment health is weakened by slight illness, which may be brought on by physical or mental overwork or debauchery, this sleeping phantom, the tissue-destroyer, has an opportunity to start its terrible work, for which it was created in hopeless ignorance of the existence of laws of nature, and then no one can tell whether it will attack the brain or other part of the body of its recipient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One may go through life without having serious manifestations of what has been injected into his blood-stream, thus thinking he was “immunized”, but, suddenly, it may begin its satanic work on his child, or even “unto third and fourth generation”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among recent developments in certain quarters of the medical trust’s own society, we find a so-called “liberal element” advocating a further policy of federal subsidization, while a more prosperous reactionary element will lobby that the old order of public exploitation may exist.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>The Christian’s Defense</span></h5>
<p><span class="font10">R</span><span class="font5">ELIGIOUS politicians often make strange and inconsistent statements, A ease in point is this: Recently a noted religionist in the National Congress pleaded for increased national armament, and in his speech declared that inadequate national armament for defense will “mean war , . . ending in the destruction of Christianity and our religious institutions”. The gentleman was only partially right. That all religions will suffer complete destruction in the worst tribulation that ever came upon the world is certain, because the Lord Jesus stated that Jehovah God has so decreed. Christianity will abide forever, because Christ Jesus, the great Christian and Savior of the world, is alive for evermore and into His hands all power and authority in heaven and in earth are committed, (Revelation 1:18; Matthew 28: 18) Christianity needs no amount of military armament for defense. If the nations of the earth see fit to provide great and extensive war equipment, that is the business of the nations and the nations’ responsibility. Such armament will be no aid whatsoever to the true followers of Christ Jesus. The Christian is one who truly follows Christ Jesus and who relies upon Jehovah and who therefore says, as it is written in the Scriptures<sup>1</sup>: “My help cometh from Jehovah, who made heaven and earth.”—Psalm 121:2, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah caused to be written in His Word, the Bible, His promise giving full assurance to the Christian that the Christian is dependent entirely upon the power of the Almighty God, whose power cannot be successfully resisted. Therefore, in the language of the Scriptures, the Christian now says: “My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.” (Psalm 7 : 10) “Because of his strength will </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">wail upon thee: for God is my defence. Unto thee, 0 my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence, and the God of my mercy.” (Psalm 59:9,17) “He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not<sup>1 </sup>be greatly moved.” (Psalm 02:2) “But the Lord is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge,” (Psalm 94:22) Jehovah’s witnesses being in Christ Jesus and knowing that Jehovah God is their Father, they know that all protection, refuge and defense come from Jehovah through Christ Jesus and that such help and protection does not come from worldly armaments. While their enemies rage against them true Christians are not at all disturbed or frightened. Like their Head and Leader, Christ Jesus, they say: “I -will love thee, 0 Lord, my strength. The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower. I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised; so shall I be saved from mine enemies.”—Psalm 18:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Religionists often refer to the Bible, but they do not rely upon the promises which Jehovah has put in the Bible, given to those who follow Christ Jesus. It is only the true Christian that can rely and that does rely upon Jehovah’s precious promises. It would be entirely inconsistent for a Christian to say that the armies of the earth can destroy Christianity. Of course, the congressman who used that expression did not know what he was talking about. Armed forces can kill men, but he who is wholly devoted to Jehovah God and His King has complete and full assurance that, if he is faithful unto death, the Lord will give him a resurrection to everlasting life. (Revelation 2:10) Relying upon God and Christ Jesus, the true Christian does not fear man or devil.—Matthew 10:26,28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. Now the nations of earth rage against each other and they build up great fortresses and provide all manner of instruments of destruction. The credulous people vainly imagine that a nation that is well equipped will prevail for ever. Dictators foolishly think they can conquer and rule all nations of earth and continue for ever. They even boastfully declare that they will destroy all Christianity. The big religionists, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, join with such dictators in a conspiracy to destroy Christians. Take note now of what Jehovah says about such: “Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing The kings of Jfie earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. He that sit-teth in the heavens shall laugh ; the Lord shall</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">have them in derision. Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.” (Psalm 2; 1-5) To Christ Jesus, the world’s rightful King, Jehovah says concerning the dictators and their religious conspirators and their allies: “Thou shaft break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.” —Psalm 2: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The kingdom of God under Christ is the only hope for lasting peace, righteousness and life. The Christian knows this truth and trusts in the Lord. He knows that the Kingdom is here and that within a very short time the godless shall perish and the righteous shall be for ever left on the earth and will for ever on the earth carry out God’s mandates. —Isaiah 9:</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6, 7.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>Would Make a Big Difference</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “Reverend Doctor” Mrs. Frederick B. Fisher has been given her deceased husband’s job in a Methodist church in Detroit. She was well equipped for the business, as appears from the fact that she designed her own costume, consisting of “a purple crepe cassock, bordered with piping of ecclesiastical red. Over it is a white silk surplice with flowing sleeves and a fringed stole of the purple crepe”. Besides all this she had “a purple velvet beretta on her head” and over her shoulders a silver cross. Now, if that wouldn’t fit any woman to run a Methodist pulpit in Michigan, what would? Any person who is a good reader can buy and read sermons by the bar</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">rel, </span><span class="font5">and, no doubt, with all that purple crepe, she ought to get along. The first time she gets to work she ought to dig out the apostle’s text in which he says, “I suffer not a woman to teach,” and explain that Paul meant the best in the world but in his day they had not got the hang of manipulating purple crepe cassocks, white silk surplices, fringed stoles and velvet berettas as they have now. That would make a big difference to the apostle, and you know it. You shouldn’t embarrass others by asking what this ecclesiastical red piping is. You know it is something good, ot Mrs. Fisher would not have used it. Some people have to have everything explained to them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ The “Reverend” R. R. Bailey, Ph.D., diocesan organizer of religious education, claims that for the last ten years the Church of England has lost 50,000 children from the Sunday schools annually, while the Nonconformist churches have lost an average of 90,000. The total loss of children from the Sunday school in the last ten years is thus set at 1,400,000, and the total collapse of the British Sunday school cannot be far away. This is the well-deserved reward that .comes to. the British clergy for the pains they have taken to teach the people that the Bible is to be held in light esteem, and that those who teaeh them the truth are their worst enemies, and the worst enemies of society, whereas, in deed and in truth, they are the best friends of both.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark76"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark77"></a>The Aegean Islands of Death</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Aegean islands of death, as they are known to the Greeks, are now among the most famous of earth’s hell-holes. Since Metaxas seized the liberties of the Grecian people, in August, 1936, more than 13,000 people who dared to think for themselves have been imprisoned on these islands. To get any allowance at all from the Metaxas regime they have to prove to the authorities that they have no means or resources. When that is established they are allowed ten drachmas (sixpence—thirteen cents) per day. Two dozen or more prisoners pool their resources, all sleep in one room, sift their own wheat, bake their own bread and provide as best they can fuel, water, shelter, and other necessities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Metaxas has put a price of £150 on the heads of exilds who have escaped, and the children of those who are caught trying to get away are held as hostages. Before being taken into exile some of the poor unfortunates were beaten with clubs oh the soles of their feet until they could not even stand. Here is an example of the rule of the Devil and of his children: Metaxas, Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, Franco, and the pope.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>“A Pack of Shameless Lies”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Would you think that any so-called “government” would unblushingly forge the signature of an opposer of its practices to a letter, in which he was supposed to denounce his own public statements of the government’s misdeeds as “a pack of shameless lies” and then circulate it all over the country? The Greek government of Metaxas did that. One Kaphandaris made the original protest. The government then published and circulated the lying manifesto, and when Kaphandaris denied and repudiated it and insisted that his original charges were correct they imprisoned him in a monastery thirty miles from the post </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">office </span><span class="font5">at Zante. Of such stuff are governments by dictators made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Greece Pays 40 Percent of Interest </span><span class="font5">♦ Greece is unable to pay anything on the principal, but this past year paid 40 percent </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">the annual interest due on the $50,000,000 loan made by the United States to aid her in earing for refugees after the World War.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark81"></a>Religious Pressure in Greece</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Religious racketeers are always anxious to squeeze every possible concession out of the politicians, and the politicians, in turn, look to the racketeers of superstition to help them keep in the saddle. In Greece, where the Greek Orthodox Church has the inside track, orphans and foundlings must be placed only in Orthodox institutions and school children must attend church on Sundays, Any person found teaching any other “religion” than the Orthodox may be fined or imprisoned and foreigners may be expelled. The erection of churches other than Orthodox without the permission of the minister of education and ecclesiastics is prohibited, and should any such buildings be erected without such consent they will be demolished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Aspirin and Mouth Organs</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Yielding to the combined pleadings and threats of Germany the governments of Yugoslavia and Greece entered into trade agreements with Germany to supply timber, tobacco and other things Germany needed or, at any rate, wanted. When they wanted something in return the Yugoslavians had to take a huge quantity of aspirin, enough to kill half the people in the country, and Greece had to take several hundred thousand mouth organs. The cheerful tones of those mouth organs ought to be a big help to the Greek Orthodox patriarch in his present efforts to hold on to his job by shutting down on all Other religious business jeopardizing his particular line of baloney. If the Grecian boys make the air too heavy with “Horst Wessel” and “Deutschland uber alles” music, the old folks can kill their nerves with the aspirin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Dictating Religion in Greece</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The dictator of Greece has issued laws, effective immediately, that no one may circulate literature objectionable to the Greek Orthodox Church. The penalty is two to six months’ imprisonment, or exile.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Joseph O’Connor is a man who has something to do with the Roman Catholic Church of the Immaculate Conception in that part of New York city known as Astoria, lie </span><span class="font5">appears to be one of the chief beneficiaries on the financial end of that institution. Being a priest of the church, it is his business to see that things are kept moving in the '‘Immaculate Conception” branch. lie must see to - it that the shekels keep coming in, and that the flock is kept secure and safe from obtaining any knowledge concerning the purposes of the Most High God, “whose name alone is Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a nice job for O’Connor when things go smoothly and well; but occasionally he has - his disappointments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of his parishioners is a woman by the name of Mae Kelly, who lives in Astoria. One day she came to Mr.‘O’Connor with a story. , She told how Jehovah’s witnesses were in town distributing their “scurrilous attacks” upon the Catholic church. They had actually been on her street, and one of them, Joseph Leathers by name, had called upon her. She tried to drive him off the street, but he wouldn’t “drive”. She encouraged her son and a group of boys to mob Leathers and picket him. But that didn’t work. She called the police, but they declined to arrest him. After all these violent efforts in behalf of the “holy” “church”, she and her son were yanked into the domestic relations court, where the boy was charged with juvenile delinquency. What should she do next?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A way was found whereby it appeared that Joseph Leathers could be punished and caused to desist from publishing the truth among the Catholics in Astoria. Mrs. Kelly went to the Magistrates’ Court in Long Island City and upon making complaint she was given a sum. mens against Joseph Leathers, requiring him to appear in court upon a charge of disorderly conduct. It was charged that he had attempted to force his way into Mrs. Kelly’s home and had used abusive language toward her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Undoubtedly Mr. O’Connor was greatly pleased with the activities of Mrs. Kelly. Here was a true crusader, a “defender of the faith”, fighting for the interests of the “holy” church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">O’Connor seized upon this as an opportunity to bring down the wrath of the church and the law and anything and anybody else available upon one of Jehovah’s witnesses. He would advise her, show' her how to act and what to say; and possibly then “his holiness” the pope might reward his priestly efforts with a new skirt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So O’Connor arranged a list of witnesses and called together a group of zealous Irish shes of the church. The pastor himself instructed them. They were coached to say that Joseph Leathers Tried to push his way into the Kelly house’; that he Tailed her a sucker for the priest’; and that he ‘forced her to listen to a record on the phonograph’. They were told to say that Leathers proclaimed himself as an enemy of the flag and of the government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After all this, Mr. O’Connor leaned back with complacency and looked forward to the day when the law would put this innocent pioneer behind the bars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. The ease was tried on August 18 in the Magistrates’ Court before Judge Anthony P. Savarese. Mrs. Kelly and the Irish shes were there. Mr. O’Connor was not there. It would not do for him to be seen; so he let the others “man” the front trenches while he, also be-skirted, kept vigil in the rear. The testimony of Mrs. Kelly and her friends was not very impressive. It showed that<sup>1</sup> they did not like the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font5"> booklet and other publications carried by the defendant. They manifested great anger over the literature and that was all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The defendant told a convincing story of how Mrs, Kelly had instigated riotous conduct against him; how she had even given him a false name, intending to dodge service of a court order. After all the testimony was taken and counsel had argued the matter, Judge Savarese took the ease under advisement and in due time entered the following decision:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Trial of this case was had in Part I, Long Island City, Magistrates’ Court upon August 18,1938, and ease was adjourned for decision until September 13, 1938, at Traffic Court, Jamaica, by Judge Savarese, both sides agreeing to file briefs in the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Court:</span><span class="font5"> Briefs filed both by the attorney for the defendant and the District Attorney’s office. The point raised by the District Attorney during the course of the hearing to the effect that this defendant was soliciting- contributions without a license in violation ,of the law is ably and amply answered in the defendant’s brief, wherein is cited the case^of People (Lovell) against the City of Griffin, opinion of Chief Justice Hughes, of the United States Supreme Court, rendered March 28, 1938. Even the District Attorney in his brief conceded it was no violation of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As to the Disorderly Conduct charged in this case, the Court-feels that the complainant resented the preachings of this defendant because of the fact they were contrary to her own religious beliefs. That if there was any disorderly conduct in this case, from the evidence before the Court, it was in a large measure precipitated by the defendant’s son and the boys who harassed this defendant on the occasion in question and the time before that. There is no evidence of disorderly conduct on the part of this defendant within the meaning of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Under all the circumstances, the complaint is dismissed and the defendant is discharged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A few days aftdr the court’s decision, the priest, O’Connor, with sadness of heart told one of his devoted parishioners that Mrs. Kelly and her friends couldn’t keep their story straight. He bitterly wailed: “After all I told them, they made a botch, of the ease.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And thus one more of the Hierarchy’s attempts to establish a Fascist rule in America, and particularly in New York city, cracked up on the rocks.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures tell what becomes of dead infants. Just notice the way it reads in Jeremiah 31:16,17: Thus saith the Lord, Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the Lord; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy. And there is hope in thine end, saith the Lord, that thy children shall come again to their own border.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That, in the light of Matthew 2:16-18, is so plain that even a theologian could hardly fail to understand it. If further light is wanted, how about the preceding verse, which explains that the little folks simply ‘are not’?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus saith the Lord, A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not.—Jeremiah 31; 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The one who knows where the little folks are is Jehovah God, and four times in those three verses occurs the expression “saith the Lord”, which really means “saith Jehovah”. Would Jehovah God, who knows how parents love their little ones, mislead His children about where their dead children are? The question answers itself. But this is what the Catholic press has to say on the subject:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has been the practice of the church, for many years, to pray to deceased baptized infants, they are certainly in heaven and hence they can intercede for us. The souls in purgatory are friends of God and hence we may pray to them and seek their intercession before the throne of God.—“The Companion of St. Francis and St, Anthony,” Montreal, January, 1938.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Two Baby Jesuses in One Magazine</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ “The Companion of Saint Francis and Saint Anthony,” Vol. 12, No. 12, distinguished itself by manufacturing two Baby Jesuses. The one in Montreal is in the nature of a wish. The “Reverend Father” Anthony, O.M.C, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">May the Baby Jesus bless and protect our Church, our government, our homes arid families, our relatives and friends, our Companions, and remain with them always. Our Christmas message. It comes from the pulpit of the manger. The tiny Jesus, poor unknown, a stranger in His own land is the silent orator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Surely one can have more confidence in the “man” Christ Jesus, who died for “the sin of the world” when He was 33 J years of age and who is now a highly-exalted heavenly King. To refer to Him as a “Baby Jesus” and a “tiny Jesus” is not only undignified, but a dishonor to Him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The second place was on' page 18, and tells of something alleged to have happened a few miles northeast of Rome. It shows how busy the Devil is to confuse the minds of the people and to make a mockery of God’s gracious arrangement. An article by “Reverend Father” Robert, O.M.C., says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">St. Francis erected with his friend, Giovanni de VeEita, the first Crib and the Divine Babe appeared in it on Christmas in the year 1223. Ever since the Crib has been an appealing Nativity Devotion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">St. Francis must have had something more than grapejuice to see in his empty crib a . Divine Babe that did not exist and could not exist. The real Jesus had ascended to heaven and had said, “The world seeth me no more,” and later appeared to Saul (who became Paul) with a glory exceeding that of the noonday sun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

At the circus in question, out of six persons in the picture three were priests in lace nighties intended to reach just below the fleshy part of the thigh. My, but they did look cute! There is not a whit more sense to that foolishness than there would be for a Buddhist or Shinto priest to cross the ocean and go through a like performance. New York and other American cities are periodically treated to like exhibitions of the world’s most impudent politicians and most conscienceless racketeers, where Jewish, Protestant and other judges are dragged into a Catholic ehureh to hear a priest, dressed in red, conduct the foolish ceremony of a “mass”.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark89"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark90"></a>- Cashing In on the Quins</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Cashing in on the Dionne quintuplets, the Hierarchy has been oh so pleased to co-operate in spreading all over the world pictures of the cute little tykes kissing the ring of Bishop Melligan.. Then, too, it helps in the “educational” work now going on of preparing all the American people for the time when they must do likewise or expect to be bumped off in accord with the teachings of the so-called “Holy Mother Church”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the quintuplets arrived the Dionne family had nothing but children—a fortune, to be sure, but with cash dividends conspicuous by their absence. Now they will have $300 a month income for being the parents of the quins, but atop of that demand a judicial investigation. Each of the quins is now worth a good-sized fortune in her own right; all are healthy, and the guardians had planned to install the entire family in a park of several acres where all would be carefully watched as to their health, especially the quins. The demanded investigation will probably upset all that. It is easy to guess who is back of all the trouble-making, and who .it is that ‘ wants the Dionne fortune.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yea, they are greedy dogs [with their collars on backwards] which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand; they all look to their own way, every one for his gain from his quarter. Come ye, say they, I will fetch</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">WE Have no desire to moralize on the subject of tobacco. We are not moralists, but practical students of cause and effect, urging the elimination of bad causes so that bad effects may be eliminated in turn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If it is true, as our scientists today agree almost unanimously, that tobacco is a poison that slowly but surely poisons the entire system, then it is equally true that freedom from the poisonous habit will bring better health, vigor and vitality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the past twelve years we have treated thousands of tobacco users. This wide experience in studying the bad effects of tobacco has convinced us that nothing else contributes so surely to poor health as does tobacco, especially cigarettes. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have been searching all these years to find a safe and dependable way to control the smoking habit, but in every attempt we have been confronted with one baffling problem, that of finding a remedy that does not require the smoker to use his nicotine-wcakencd will power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this connection, we have clearly demonstrated that will power is closely associated ivith breathing; that the habitual smoker breathes almost entirely through the upper lobes of the lungs; and that this faulty respiration causes an intoxication of the breathing control center and a weakening of the will power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This simple self-treatment offered herein is based on two scientific premises: first, the strengthening of the poisoned breathing center with oxygen forced deep into the oxy gen-starved lower lobes of the lungs; and, second, the stimulated elimination of nicotine toxins from the system with copious quantities of plain drinking water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Water Treatment: Immediately upon arising every morning drink one pint of hot water. In the middle of the forenoyn, one-half hour before lunch, in the middle of the afternoon, and one-half hour before dinner, drink one pint of coon water, not iced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Oxygen Treatment: Whenever you feel like smoking, breathe deeply, forcing enough oxygen deep into the lungs to expand the chest to its full capacity, and hold your breath while you count eight, then expel the air with a forced “puff”, and repeat this five times. This will take one minute. liepeat as often as any desire to smoke returns; at first, as often - as every half hour or so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The treatment should be used according to one of the following two plans:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Plan One: For smokers who desire to cut down on smoking. Confine your smoking to one smoke after each meal, and one before retiring. Use the deep-breathing exercise between these smokes. Continue the “water treatment” daily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Flan Two: For smokers who desire to quit the habit “for good”'. The first week, reduce your smokes to four a day. The second week, to three a day. The third week, stop smoking. Use the treatment as outlined above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are daily asked this question: “How long must I take the self-treatment?” The time varies, ranging from five to thirty days. —Damon and Damon, California.</span></p>

November 10, 1933, he inquired when the German people had ever broken their word. Exactly six months later he announced that they had recreated a German air force, which, by treaty, they had agreed not to do; and after six more days announced conscription, which, also, they had agreed not to do. May 21, 1935, he stated that the German government would scrupulously fulfill all its obligations under the Treaty of Locarno; and nine mobths and seventeen days later denounced the treaty and violated it by occupying the demilitarized Rhineland zone. March 7, 1936, he said Germany has no territorial demands to make in Europe; and two years and four days later annexed Austria. August 27, 1936, he said Germany' would not intervene in the war in Spain ; and three days later 28 German planes arrived in Cadiz. January 30, 1937, he said the period of surprises is over and peace is Germany’s dearest treasure. Only twenty-seven days after he reaffirmed the sovereignty of Austria he seized the country.

<p><span class="font5">PUT a wick in oil (called a flare or torch) and it will give some light and heat around the outside, where it can burn some air. In the center it is all smoke and carbon, giving only a few candle power. This is poor combustion, because most of the fuel is waste. This represents a person of poor health, with poor or lazy lungs and shallow breathing. These often have sunken and flat chests. Forced breathing with exercise will remodel the flat chest and weak lungs. Good health will result speedily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Take a lamp with a round and hollow wick, with a glass chimney; this increases the air that it burns and gives a little more light and heat and better combustion or mixture of air and Oil, which is a little more efficient. This represents a person of a little better health but with still not enough heat to properly burn his food. Some people use artificial heat during mealtime. This helps some, but is not nature’s way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Take a light and place a mantle over the flame. (The lungs are the mantle of the body. A mantle looks like a fine sieve.) This enables more air do mix and burn with the oil or flame, so that it gives off a white, hot light like an electric light of about two hundred candle power. The heat increases with the light. (Lack of heat lets food sour in the stomach.) This is good combustion and is claimed to burn with 98 percent efficiency, or consumes only 2 percent oil. Ninety-eight percent of the fuel this lamp burns is air. In the body it is called “breath of lives”. This represents a person of good health with good lungs and using them. As efficiency increases the fuel and food decreases and more air is burned. This gives less waste. No food or fuel burns in itself without air; not even gasoline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The air contains all the life-giving elements and can burn and balance any food or fuel by supplying the lacking elements. This can be proved during mealtime. When one takes notice that his food is not burning properly, let him start immediately to take deep breathing and continue after meal for five to ten minutes or until he feels results. Don’t wait until it sours and then take some dope to make it burn. This is important.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">High efficiency or good combustion requires and gives off great heat, which is lacking when food doesn’t burn or gets sour. Nature gives many signals. Few people know what they mean. For instance, a cold is merely this: The temperature is too low for good combustion or for the food to burn, and the system is choked with food. More breathing and, exercise and less food will remedy the condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Surely a good body with good lungs would be more efficient than the best machine or light a man can make or build. This should start every honest person to thinking for himself. One can’t buy the truth or health. The 'same air burns every kind of fuel, and balances them all; some fuel or foods take more air than others. Persons with little breathing can burn only food that burns easily or with less air. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Therefore the lungs are the chief organs that determine the efficiency of the body. All the other organs of the body depend on the lungs for their existence. They handle all the food of the body. All the food that enters the mouth and the stomach reaches the lungs and is there balanced and energized, having entered the blood. The lungs are the least considered organs of the body. They don’t even make pills for them. The butchers throw them away but eat the other organs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All one has to do who desires better health is to increase the efficiency of the body. That may mean more breathing capacity or eating less food, as the case may be. When poor efficiency (poor health) exists there is a lack of energy felt in the body. Through the lack of proper knowledge this causes the eating of . more and better food, which generally works to the opposite, lowering the efficiency still more, and conditions get worse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every cubic inch of increased breathing capacity results in better health to the entire body. There are no defective parts of the body that nature cannot repair. You do the breathing ; the body .will do the repairing, or keep healthy. One breathes only about one-tenth of the amount when asleep, and persons of poor health breathe so much less that some look like a corpse in the morning. They are very tired, due to the fact that they are starved to death for the want of ‘ffireath of lives”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There arc many enemies to breathing. Anything tha't burdens or disturbs the nerves automatically reduces breathing. Brain-workers have trouble with their breathing and food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Everything opposite to happiness makes breathing difficult. Some children almost strangle when scolded; this is bad at mealtime or after meaJ until food is fully burned up or digested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Increased or forced breathing can be practiced in connection with any kind of exercise. All one needs to do to he convinced is to try, and no more proof is needed. Get your lungs strong some way best suited to yourself. Miracles will follow. If your food makes trouble, draft eat so much, and not so often. Practice deep breathing after each meal, especially abdominal breathing if troubled with constipation If belts are worn, use the kind that stretches or contains elastic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If one is not well he is short-winded, whether he knows it or not. If not convinced, run around the block and ask someone to listen to your breathing. That is how one determines the health of a race horse. If the wind is good, then the health is generally good. Good breathing capacity and good health run parallel to-, each other. This is nature’s way of right-living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Besides poison food we eat, like aluminum salts, etc., there is a most alarming poison people breathe which goes by unnoticed, that is due to the burning of oil and gas with open flame. They burn the very life elements one needs and fill the house with poison gas or exhaust. Gas or kerosene ranges and heaters where the fumes are not carried to the chimney should not be used in the home. Why not keep the home healthful, and regain health at home instead of seeking health resorts’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a knowm fact that when people get sick in homes where gas is burned they seldom recover unless removed from such a home or unless different fuel is used for cooking. Generally the cooks get sick during the winter months. You can’t fool nature by breathing poison for the life elements. In grus or oil you buy only a small part of the fuel; the bulk is life elements robbed from the home. Examine a gas burner; note the small hole for gas and the large opening for the life elements (air) to enter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A pioneer from Pennsylvania went to Florida to work one winter. He had expected to see most of the people in good health, but upon returning he said: &quot;I found more people with eolds during the winter there than in-Pennsylvania.” The sunshine does no good unless one breathes it in ; and if one does that he wdll be well in any state or country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In warm states they don’t need permanent heat, and depend more on open heaters: Inhaling this poison they often lose more health than they gain by the extra sunshine.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By J. Hem&amp;ry {London)</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark112"></a>Journey to Rome</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">• The prime minister has been to Rome, has had his talks with Mussolini, and apparently things are much as they were. The conversations occupied 2 hours 40 minutes. Those who fear Mr. Chamberlain’s policy of appeasement and consider that he is no match for the cunning and forcefulness of the two dictators Hitler and Mussolini feel relieved that he has given nothing away. The result of the journey remains to be seen. That the British prime minister was welcomed by the people of Rome, and was welcomed by the Italian people, is indicative of their desire for peace between the greater nations of Europe: it has much the same significance as the demonstration of the German people in Munich when Mr. Chamberlain went there. The now noted umbrella seems to be a symbol: it and his manner of dress are in violent contrast to the sword and the uniform of the war-hungry politicians. Mr. Chamberlain and his companion Lord Halifax, foreign secretary, also visited the pope, and were received by him in the splendor of his palace. There also, it is reported, were merely the exchanges of friendly relationships. There is no question of the pope’s pleasure in this visit; for the Roman Hierarchy wants the good will of Britain at this time when Roman Catholicism is being crowded in by the dictators. Pius XI was hoping presently to tell the great democracies of Britain and the United States of his love for them and of his admiration of democracy as a form of government. The dictators have realized that which most of the democratically governed peoples have not yet learned, that is, that the Papacy is a great political organization, and that if the dictators are to rule their people the Papacy must be subdued or got out of the way altogether. The Hierarchy is astute, with the cunning of Satan: it will seek the favor of the democracies and of the dictator states (it has a concordat with both), being all things to all men in pursuit of its aim to get control of the earth. The professed Protestant religious organizations have much blame upon them for this blindness of the people about Rome’s purpose; for they exalt Rome as the first and greatest of the religious farces in the earth and acknowledge it as the mainstay in these days when the worship of God is being supplanted by the pursuit of pleasure or by the worship of the god of forces. The pope presented Mr. Chamberlain with a gold medal bearing on one side portraits of the two Englishmen whom he canonized a few years ago ■—the only Englishmen canonized since the Reformation; on the reverse side is a portrait of the pope, who fixed them as “saints” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">“heaven”. The pope said he kept the portraits of these men near to him and constantly invoked their prayers that such valiant defenders of the faith may be raised up in this day. Mr. Chamberlain is a Unitarian, but perhaps he may be led to try for the help of these “saints”, though as a non-believer in the atonement of Jesus for the sin of the world he </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font5">not a Christian, and he needs to be converted before a Roman “saint” can pd his prayers. Perhaps now these “saints” will get busy on his conversion or an accommodation may be arranged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On present showing it appears that the British premier and Mussolini will get closer together than either of them with Hitler: the interests of Britain and Italy are nearer each other than those at the Berlin end of the Rome-Berlin axis; and Mussolini has more humanity in him than the German Fuehrer understands.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark113"></a>Strife and Confusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">• Not only is the air over the oceans and continents filled with conflicting statements by the politicians, and, too, by the vituperations of some, but the homelands of the peoples are filled with them. Morning by morning the newspapers report or distort the overnight speeches of the politicians who most heartily differ both as to the effect of past policies and as to what ought to be done. Times of stress always bring violence of speech as well as action, normal to the conditions: a politician is a hero or a villain according to his partisan’s or opponent’s reactions. Some politicians believe in administering their medicines by doses; some are like surgeons: they believe in the knife. Perhaps both are useful in their world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is now widely admitted that the Government departments which were responsible for the recent air-raid preparations acted like men in a panic. Criticism, especially of tilings in the past, is a comparatively cheap and easy matter; but there is no question that the £1)0,000,000 expended by the Government was almost wasted. The gas masks are gone, and the hurriedly dug small trenches are pitiable things when contemplated as shelters •against air attacks. Steel is being ordered in large quantities with the expectation of having some real protection against the devastating bombs now allowed as a future certainty. No one knows when the dread thing may happen; many think the next few months will not go past without the outbreak of war; others are sure that, the possible enemies of Britain are not in position to undertake what must be a certain victory or their own destruction. The astrologers, aided by the popular press for circulation purposes, have it both ways: according to these stargazers and prognosticators war is going to come soon, and it is not. You take your choice according to the paper you buy. The newspapers are pandering to the credulity of foolish people: at present there is something of a craze for the daily news of the stars. Most of the news is probably made up at a desk in the newspaper office, stated according to the mentality of the persons who make up the “readings”.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark114"></a>Industrial Conscription</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">® A Fleet Street journalist who is a prospective Labor candidate for Parliament has been speaking plainly about the Government’s voluntary national service registration. He declares that its agreement, made under some pressure, to have its scheme made voluntary for three months as a trial is nothing but a sham. Venturing, he says, on the danger line of the Official Service Acts, he avers that the Government in agreeing to give their proposals a trial for three months on a voluntary basis deliberately arranged that the system could not be successful, because of delays in organization which would inevitably prevent such a system from having a chance to prove itself before the compulsory phase must become operative. As the Government has a majority that will do its bidding, and very many of the party ready supporters of compulsory service, there seems to be little doubt that within a few months there will be in Britain a compulsory enrolling of labor and of all persons able to take up some form of service for the interests of the State. The Labor man . says, “There remain very few weeks before every man and woman will be forced to enljst in some form of Government service, foregoing all their industrial rights, forfeiting all their social privileges, and sacrificing their individual liberty. The right to work where they like will be taken from trade unionists; the right to shop where they like will be lost to co-operators ; the right to print what they like will be taken from the press; the right to speak what they think will be denied to preachers ... in a few weeks’ time such freedom will sustain the fiercest attack ever known in the history of this country.”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark115"></a>Thunder from the Left</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">© The two big literary guns of the Left, II. G. Wells and J. B. Priestly, are in action. Air. Wells, the seer, sees a great revulsion of feeling coming against the present so-called “National Government” and its policy of appeasement of the two dictators of central and southern Europe, and because of its dilatoriness in enacting measures for the relief and betterment of the people; also, as he believes, because of the growing conviction that the members of the Government have not sufficient mental equipment to take the care of the great interests in their hands. He prophesies an early sweeping election that will clear the ground of them and give place and power to a government which really represents the people and their needs. Mr. Priestly is as definite in what he has to say about the apparent recklessness of the Government and their determination to keep the .Right people in the Right place. In the meantime the Labor party is entering into labor. It is not united, and, fearful of losing what Labor has gained for itself in its long years of struggle with capitalism, it refuses to combine with those who are not of its party though as much opposed to the continuance of the present National Government as it is. However, Sir Stafford Cripps, perhaps its most able man, has thrown a bombshell into the camp by making a direct appeal apart from the leaders of the party, and it may be that he will emerge as leader of a united party which can show some promise of realizing Mr, Wells’ vision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Latest news from the war conditions of Europe are- 1 he ri-organizat ion of the German army, and that Hitler is again mobilizing it, this time for its Spring exercises with some concentration on the western front, an action which will set France on the jump and surely keep Britain on the war danee. Also Jjjfanco got his big prize, Barcelona, with the only certain result: an early end of his rebellion. This is a great victory for the Italians, who are greatly rejoiced, for the German gunmen, for Franco’s Moors, and for him, the “'great Christian gentleman”; for the British Catholic press and for Roman Catholicism in general. What it is to be for the conquered and in its repercussions through Europe remains to be seen. .</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark116"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark117"></a>“God’s Money”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">• A preacher of the Church of Scotland told the members of its General Assembly that they, the clergy, should take up a new attitude about money; they should stop talking about it in the “old mealy-mouthed-way”. It should be demanded; “the money is there; it is God’s money, and God’s' church is needing it; the church is not getting it, but other things are, and the church must just get it . . . the necessity is staring us in the face.” More church buildings are required to keep up the establishment. That complaint is common to all the religious systems: they are in the same condition as the nations whose population is lessening. Presumably moral pressure will be put on such congregations as are now supporting the big buildings these organizations have erected and maintain at heavy expense, made harder to bear by reason of the cost of the parson and his manse. The system is a costly one at any time. Expecting to continue to be able to milk the flocks the religious organizations have taken the way used by the big banks and insurance corporations: they have erected big and imposing structures, professedly for the glory of God, but actually for their own glory. The God whom they profess to worship did not call on them to do this for Him, and as professed disciples of Jesus and in the ‘true apostolic succession’ they ought to have known better than copy Rome and try to impose on the world. If they were of God’s church the call for money would not be made; the “churches” would never have been more than convenient meeting places. Here, then, is the way out of their difficulty. Let them realize on their church buildings, and let their preachers become disciples of Jesus copying the way of the apostles, and their troubles would be dropped overnight. This course they will never take; they will never be got to believe it to be the right way. Jesus said of such as they, “How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?” (John 5:44) The big church buildings, with the dogmas they represent, and the big and little preachers (as such) will perish together. These men can see the red light which means a stoppage in their run, but they shut their eyes to the red light of the warning which is continually being shown to them. But as to that it may be said they are color-blind, and they have no hesitancy in saying that those who warn them are crazed.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark118"></a>“Moral Rearmament”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">• This is one of the catchwords now in cur-' rent use. It is used, mostly by that oil and water combination of religion and morals and worldly wisdom known as the “Oxford Group”, whose chief representative is Frank Buchman. Perhaps it is Frank’s coinage; for it appears to have had its birth at a conference of Groupers who met in Switzerland in September. The weed-end around September 11 is somewhat marked: Hitler was waiting for the British premiers visit to Munich; the small “antiGod congress”—about which the Roman Catholics made so much noise for their own ends —was being held in London; the Groupers were morally rearming in Switzerland, and, outstandingly, Judge Rutherford called the world to face the facts. The meaning of the term “moral rearmament” is about as elusive as the dogmas of the Group, which is in no way connected with the city of Oxford or its colleges. That it is attractive to some is apparent ; for it has numerous “sharers” throughout the earth. It is surely an unlimited society; for Hitler is one of Mr. Buchman’s friends, and Himmler, one of the chiefs of that terrible organization, is a Grouper. One wonders what sins he confesses when he is in a sharers’ meeting. That it is not of God, nor has any relation to Christ, is apparent to those who know Christ, and that it has no use for the Word of God can be seen by any person who compares its claims and practices with the Scriptures. It claims to bring its sharers, those who have experienced a “change”, into direct relationship with God; and it is claimed that God accepts all these as they claim His guidance and leave their minds open for His direction for all business affairs and all other matters of life. Jesus said, ‘No man cometh to the Father but by me,’ and none can flnd-God or have any access to Him except in His appointed way.—John 14:6.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark119"></a>Popes Pius IX and Pius XII</span></h5>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">P</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ope Pius IX, noted for his severity and perfidy, for the utterance of the dogma of the “immaculate conception?, _for the claim to infallibility, for the re-establishment of the Inquisition, for the shooting or decapitation of 500 Roman citizens, for the destruction of the Roman constitution which he had guaranteed, for his unreserved surrender to the Jesuits, and for the fact that he was the last one of the popes to hold both temporal and spiritual rule (until 1929), and was the first pope ever to have visited America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Giovanni Maria Mastai Ferretti (Pius IX), though alleged to be of Jewish descent, became a priest in 1819, at which time he was 27 years of age, and four years later, in 1823 and 1824, served as auditor to the apostolic delegate Muzi, at Santiago, Chile. Having been a Freemason in bis youth, he visited the Freemasons at Philadelphia, Pa., U. S. A,, on his return to Italy in the summer of 1825. If memory serves correctly, one pope was expelled from the Freemasons; and this may have been the one.—See Judge Rutherford’s book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies,</span><span class="font5"> pages 254-257.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pope Pius XII, Eugenio Pacelli, is also noted for his severity. This severity was mentioned twice in the first account of his selection, as published in the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">WorldTelegram</span><span class="font5"> of March 2, 1939. How about reestablishing the Inquisition? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As Cardinal Pacelli, Pope Pius XII is accredited (under Gasparri) with bringing about the accord between Mussolini and the Vatican which re-established the temporal power of the pope, February H, 1929. Will he be as totally under Jesuit control as Pius IX? The principal feature of his trip to America was the reception of a degree at the Jesuit Fordham University, in New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">World-Telegram</span><span class="font5"> erred in its headline, “Pius XII is the first pontiff ever to have seen America,” as above shown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is no doubt that Pacelli is right on his toes. Six feet tall, and of a long-lived family, he is a devotee of the airplane, and went ' all over the United States in one when here in 1936. That he will “move heaven and earth” to bring all mankind into, complete submis- * sion and subjection goes without saying.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“ . . . a Catholic bishop arrogantly threatens the president of the United States unless he conforms to the will of the Hierarchy.
