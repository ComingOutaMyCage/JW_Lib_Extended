<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Convention of Kingdom Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">in Lucerne, Switzerland, Sept. 4-7, 1936 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">m. c.</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"> Harbech</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HE most impressive convention of Jehovah’s witnesses ever held in Central Europe—as many expressed themselves—took place this year from September 4 to September 7 at Lucerne, Switzerland. The convention itself was a strong evidence of the fulfillment of prophecy, that Jehovah has built up Zion and that He has appeared in His glory. The Lord’s people had the use of a new wonderful building beautifully situated right on the shore of the Vierwald-stattersee in Lucerne, in the heart of Switzerland, which is populated chiefly by Catholics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As to participants of many nations, the convention may be compared only to the international convention which took place in Paris in 1931. There were representatives at Lucerne from the following countries: United States of America, Spain, France, Belgium, Holland, England, Denmark, Danzig, Scandinavia, the Baltic States, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Rumania, Austria, Finland and Switzerland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">By Thursday evening, September 3, a large number of visitors had arrived in Lucerne, and at the opening of the convention, Friday afternoon, the three convention halls were almost filled. The number of those taking part grew from hour to hour, until Sunday about 3,500 brethren and Jonadabs were gathered together to study Jehovah’s Word and to give an effective witness to the glory of His name. They came by special train, by autobus, by private car, by bicycle, and some traveled great distances on foot. Without question, in that large number there were many Jonadabs.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Faithfulness of German Brethren</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Knowing of the great difficulties under which the German brethren labor and witness, it was very encouraging to think that several hundred German brethren had come to Lucerne in the face of danger and death. There was evidence of German spies, and even when about to enter Switzerland a number of German brethren were arrested on the frontier. The Secret Police in Germany was aware of the convention, and just before the convention a large number of German brethren were again arrested and their passports were taken away from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The themes of the discourses were prescribed by the Society’s office, and thus all discourses were in harmony with </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> articles, supplementing each other beautifully. All discourses were amplified by loud-speakers, and the most important ones were recorded on gramophone records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Newspaper reporters were present, and several published sympathetic reports in the press. One in particular, observing the whole organization, mentioned the marvelous unity, the determination and the courage of Jehovah’s witnesses in their battle for truth and righteousness.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>President's Address to Kingdom Publishers</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Sunday forenoon Judge Rutherford refreshed all who were present by many practical and Scriptural thoughts. Amongst other things, he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A true Christian needs not to be encouraged to serve the Lord, because he realizes the privilege to serve the Lord unselfishly. The purpose of our gathering together is to make progress in getting understanding and wisdom concerning Jehovah, in order that we may be the better equipped to keep our covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He then explained the scripture, “For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This Scriptural rule has reference to all of the Lord’s people, without regard to their position or to the class in which they find themselves. However, to the spirit begotten ones more is given and more is entrusted, and therefore more will be required of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord requires three things particularly of a true Christian, namely: to do justly, to exercise mercy, and to walk obediently and humbly before the Lord. This means that we must be just to all, and if the Lord gives us an opportunity to exercise justice, we must do so with mercy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To be loyal means that we must act exactly in harmony with the will and the interests of the Lord. It is possible for one to act in harmony with God’s will and yet not to be faithful. The responsibility grows with knowledge and understanding how to be faithful. To be loyal means to carry out the assigned duty exactly. But faithfulness means more than that. It means to do all within our power and to constantly, faithfully and zealously do what Jehovah has commanded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our devotion to Jehovah must not be divided. It is an evidence of fear of men when we seek to please men. A fearless follower of the Lord fears neither Devil nor man. A faithful Christian will not use the soft pedal with respect to the truth and its proclamation. Faithfulness means to be fully devoted to the Lord God, first, last and all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the conclusion of the forenoon session a Resolution presented by the president of the Society was accepted with great applause, a copy of which follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">RESOLUTION AT LUCERNE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(Adopted unanimously)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah’s witnesses now assembled in Lucerne, Switzerland, having come from many parts of the earth to worship Jehovah in spirit and in truth, take this occasion to give thanks to the Almighty God, whose name alone is Jehovah, for His manifold blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Knowing full well that Jehovah always faithfully performs His promise, and that long centuries ago He promised that He would establish on earth His kingdom of righteousness with Christ Jesus as the world’s rightful Ruler; and now seeing from the fulfillment of prophecy that the day of Jehovah’s kingdom is here, we rejoice in the privilege of being His servants and His witnesses and we do declare our unqualified allegiance to the Almighty God and His kingdom, and delight to make known to suffering humankind that the kingdom of God under Christ is the only hope of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We fully appreciate that Satan is the great enemy of all who serve Jehovah God and that Satan has used religionists at all times to oppose and persecute those who worship God in spirit and in truth. For this reason many true followers of Christ Jesus are today prevented from attending this convention, they being held in restraint in Germany and in other places, not for wrongdoing, but because they serve God and Christ Jesus and declare His Word and His kingdom as God has commanded them to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The law of Jehovah God is supreme. He is above all; and as Jesus and the apostles served God first, last, and all the time, and as they declared so we declare, we will obey God rather than men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We call all good people to witness that in Germany, Austria and other places Jehovah’s witnesses are cruelly persecuted, imprisoned, fiendishly abused, and many of them killed, and all such wickedness is done against them by a cruel, malicious, wicked power, incited so to do by the religious organization, to wit, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which for many years has deceived the people and blasphemed God’s holy name. The Hitler government, aided and incited by the Jesuits of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, has inflicted and continues to inflict all manner of cruel punishment upon true Christians even as Christ Jesus and His apostles were persecuted for righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God has commanded His servants to now give warning to such wicked ones (Ezekiel 33: 8,9) that full responsibility may rest upon the wicked for their wrongdoing, and for that reason we now sound the warning to the rulers in Germany and to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and to all like organizations that cruelly persecute the true and faithful followers of Christ Jesus, that the fate of such God declares is complete destruction. (Psalm 145:20) Jesus Christ, at Matthew 25, pronounces Jehovah’s judgment against such wicked persecutors who persecute the true followers and brethren of Christ Jesus, in these words: ‘Inasmuch as ye have done it to [cruelly ill-treated] the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his angels. These shall go into everlasting destruction. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We vigorously protest against the cruel treatment of Jehovah’s witnesses by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and its allies in Germany and in all other parts of the world, but we are delighted to leave the end thereof entirely in the hand of the Lord God, who, according to His Word, will render a full recompense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We sound the warning to all mankind that if they would live they must refuse to give aid and support to religionists who persecute the true followers of Christ Jesus, and that they must take their stand on the side of righteousness and give heed to the words of Jehovah, to wit: ‘Behold my servant, whom I have chosen ... He shall show judgment to the nations. . . . And in His name shall the nations hope. ’—Matthew 12: 18-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As the followers of Christ Jesus we have no part in and no interest in the political affairs of this world. Our sole purpose and co</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font5">ission is to make known the name and the kingdom of God under Christ, that the people may be informed and intelligently choose whom they will serve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We send loving greetings to our persecuted brethren in Germany and bid them to be of good courage and to rely solely upon the promises of the Almighty God Jehovah, and Christ, and to remember the words of Jesus: ‘Shall not God avenge His elect shortly? He shall avenge them’ (Luke 18: 7, 8) ; and, further, the words of the Lord Jesus addressed to His faithful servants: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.’’ (Revelation 2: 10) Blessed is your lot that you are permitted to endure all manner of suffering for the sake of the name of Jehovah and His kingdom under Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The everlasting peace, joy and life of the people depend entirely upon the great ‘ ‘ Prince of Peace ’ ’, whose government will be administered in peace and righteousness.—Isaiah 9: 6, 7; 32: 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Resolved that a copy of this resolution be sent to Mr. Hitler and to the pope at Vatican City as the head of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Both letters were sent by registered mail, and a confirmation was received from Vatican City and also from Berlin, that both copies reached their destination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Publishers in Catholic Territory</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Monday was the day assigned to service and to the public witness in the evening. Preparations were made to cover the central part of Switzerland within a circle of 50 kilometers of Lucerne with the booklet </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Choosing.</span><span class="font8"> The original cantons of Switzerland, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden and Lucerne, are so-called “Catholic territory”. A thousand publishers started Monday morning early. At the same time the city of Lucerne was covered with booklets and the leaflet inviting to the public lecture at night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The president of the Society and the chairman of the convention had received a letter Saturday afternoon from the military and police department of the canton Lucerne, stating that the distribution of the literature would come under a commercial police regulation and that permission must be had.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Monday forenoon two brethren called upon the city president and also upon the cantonal authorities and gave the explanation that the literature is not to be sold and that the distribution of the booklets had already begun. The chief of the Cantonal government then received a sample of the booklet in question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thereupon the Cantonal government called a hurry-up meeting and decided to confiscate the booklets and to forbid the public meeting that night. This decision or official notice was then served upon the president of the Society and upon the chairman of the convention. A telegram protesting against this action was then sent to the president of Switzerland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">While the conferences with the authorities took place, the distribution of the booklets was finished in the whole of the territory provided for the occasion. Of course, the Devil was very mad about it all! Approximately 108 brethren were arrested, but all were soon released.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The first arrests took place in Ruswil, a village where the last burning of ‘‘heretics” took place in the eighteenth century. Others were arrested in Altorf, Uri, the home of William Tell, the author of the Swiss motto, “Liberty and equal rights for all!” Some had to deposit a certain sum of money in order to be released, while others were escorted to Lucerne by the police and there imprisoned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One policeman in the canton Unterwalden committed a very outrageous act. A brother had been stopped by a civilian who asked him to show his papers. The brother requested this man to prove his authority to question him. This he refused to do, whereupon the brother drove on. Shortly thereafter the civilian came along on a motorcycle and without notice or warning fired several shots into the tires of the brother’s car. The brother was then taken to the office of the cantonal police, which justified and approved the illegal action of the policeman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In spite of the desperate efforts on the part of the clergy and the police to prevent the distribution of the booklet </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Choosing,</span><span class="font8"> more than 10,000 copies thereof were placed in the hands of the people within about an hour; 2,215 copies of this booklet were confiscated during the campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From a specially Catholic village a small parcel containing the ashes of publicly burnt booklets was received here. A letter was enclosed therein, stating that the “very reverend Dean” had ordered this auto-da-fe and that if we would come again we would receive a good beating. The letter was not signed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Futile Attempt to Stop Lecture<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark38">1</a></sup></span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Such were the events outside of Lucerne. The fight continued in the city itself. Judge Rutherford declared to the president of the city that he would give his lecture in any case and that, if they wanted to, they could proceed to arrest him and to clear out the whole building. Judge Rutherford kept his word; he gave the lecture “Armageddon”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Quite a large crowd, about 2,000, gathered outside the hall (a voice amplifier in the corridor enabled all of these to hear), and some occasionally voiced their indignation because of such unnecessary and violent measures. The people clearly gave to understand that they knew only too well who was at the back of these shameful happenings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some of the conventioners went among the crowd in order to find out whether the people were really of the opinion that our activity was undesirable; they were agreeably surprised to see that the contrary was true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Judge Rutherford spoke powerfully about the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Some of the higher police officials were in the hall and heard the lecture. When asked whether or not those things stated by the speaker were true, all the policemen admitted that they had not heard anything objectionable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Until late in the night one could see some small groups of people standing in front of the Congress Hall discussing the illegal procedure of the Lucerne authorities. There had been no disturbance of any kind, which shows once more by what subtle means the representatives of the Hierarchy try to make the most peaceable men appear as criminals.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Publishers Standing for Their Lives</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">It was a treat to hear Judge Rutherford speak to the convention after the time when the convention should have been closed according to program and before the beginning of the public lecture. Among other things, he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For fifteen hundred years the religionists have claimed the sole right and ability to explain the Bible. Because one is a preacher or a clergyman, that is no reason to believe that he understands the Scriptures. Let us examine the facts, and then everybody will be able to see that the prophecies are being fulfilled. Ezekiel told of a great organization which would arise in the earth and which would consist of religion, politics and finance, and that these elements would work against the interests of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here in Lucerne we have today the absolute confirmation of the fulfillment of prophecy. This convention was announced four months ago. The hall was rented and paid for. The hotels kindly made the necessary arrangements in order that we might stay here, and the Society had deposited 20,000 franes as a guarantee for the payment of the bills to the hotels, so that they shouldn’t suffer any damage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No religious organization has done that so far. A church organization would first have taken up a collection. The president of the Society was to speak to the public this evening at eight o’clock. This meeting was announced ten days ago on placards, and many even ’phoned to say that they would attend the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">However, it is sure that the clergy told the people to stay away from this lecture. But fearing that the people of Lucerne might take no notice of this warning, the clergy ran to the politicians of the canton and said: “There will surely be disturbances if this lecture is held. ” That was but a pretext; for everybody knows very well that the conventioners do not cause disturbances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus the clergy caused the Cantonal government to hand us today an order prohibiting to speak publicly in this hall, for the reason that the religious susceptibilities of the people of Lucerne might be offended. That also is but a well-known excuse; because if anyone thinks that his religious susceptibilities might be hurt, he can stay at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I always thought that Switzerland was a free country, and it has been a good, old republic for over a thousand years. The Constitution of Switzerland guarantees religious liberty and the freedom of speech and assembly. The clergy didn’t trust the people, and rightly so, and they were afraid that so many francs would no more go into their pockets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I do not know whether I shall be able to speak tonight, but I went to see the president of the city this afternoon and I told him that I would go to the convention hall and speak there at eight o’clock. I gave it to him in writing that we had not come here to cause any disturbances; for nobody who loves the Lord will do any such thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is evident that there is a conspiracy in order to fight against God and against His kingdom. We do not know now what may happen at eight o’clock; but we do know one thing, and that is that the Lucerne authorities together with the clergy are afraid that the people might learn the truth. However, we shall not injure anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At your expense you have come to this convention from nearly twenty different countries. You have spent much money and your only desire and endeavor was to help your fellow man to learn something about God’s purpose. My dear brethren, even if we had no other sign, we would see the fulfillment of prophecy before our eyes today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Cantonal government may do something this evening in order to prevent the public meeting. If it does, it denies the Constitution of Switzerland, it takes away from the people the right and freedom of assembly, and then it shall also bear the responsibility. In his own good time the Lord will repay to all, for the truth is powerful and will be victorious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Concluding, I will but say this: By the grace of the Lord I shall be here at eight o ’clock. I ask you to remain quiet and not to leave the hall. Be respectful, even if the police should try to clear out the hall. I am very glad that this happened, for it will all contribute to a much stronger witness than might have been possible otherwise. The decision of the government to prohibit the lecture of this evening will make more people see the truth than anything else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then go home to your country with the firm determination to proclaim the truth more than ever and to trust in the Lord. I hope that the police now hear what I say and that they tell the clergy about it. Tonight I shall only say that which is written in God’s Word, and the Lord will do the rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Swiss Officials Groveling Before the Harlot</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After the decision of the government had been communicated to the press, the papers did not fail to declare themselves against it. Practically all the daily papers discussing the happenings in Lucerne wrote of their astonishment at such a measure of the Lucerne government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A leading Swiss paper, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Die Neue Ziircher Zeitung,</span><span class="font8"> even wrote that it was regrettable that Judge Rutherford coidd not speak, because his lecture would have afforded an opportunity to get better acquainted with the aims of this man and of the movement as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How much this measure of the Lucerne authorities is like those taken by the German Police State is seen in the order of prohibition of all public meetings organized by Jehovah's witnesses, which order the Lucerne government issued after the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The smaller hall of the Congress building had been rented by contract for follow-up meetings, and the government having in its written order only prohibited Judge Rutherford to speak, we advertised the first follow-up lecture in the papers. This lecture was to take place Thursday, September 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">However, when the advertisement was published in the papers, the Lucerne City administration told our office here on the ’phone that this lecture in the Congress Hall was prohibited as well. Immediately the local company of Jehovah’s witnesses rented another hall, and in the evening the numerous people who came to the Congress Hall were directed to the newly rented place. However, when we arrived there, there was a detective who told us orally that this meeting was not allowed to be held either.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When asked to produce a written motivation of this order, he showed the written prohibition of the town council, according to which Jehovah’s witnesses are forbidden all further activity in the canton of Lucerne. Then there arrived 72 policemen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many people who stood before the building were very angry when they learned the reason for this order of the town council. They said that they now saw their real enemies. Even policemen stated that they were very sorry that they had to proceed against us in this way, for they said that our cause was a good one and that they were interested in it.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>A Joyful and Successful Witness</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The brethren were very joyful because of these events in Lucerne and they all stated that they would carry on the fight with even greater energy than heretofore. A fire has been lighted which surely cannot be put out any more. The whole population must be informed about this wrong and unjust procedure of the authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Closing, we would mention that our stay in Lucerne generally made a very good impression. This we have been told by civic authorities as well as by the Hotel Association and private people who had let rooms to us. They said that our people had left everything in the best order, that they were kind and considerate. We were pleased to hear this as well from a lawyer who came in touch with well-known men of the city. ‘The spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are God’s children.’ This word of the apostle is surely appropriate in this connection. However, Lucerne has not been aware of the fact that under the influence of its religious leaders it has done a great wrong to God’s faithful servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Judge Rutherford’s lectures were all recorded, and also the adoption of the Resolution. Copies will be made, and thus the lecture and all the wonderful proceedings will be made to re-echo in all the valleys of Switzerland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Kind provision was also made for the pioneers and the Lord’s poor. Eight hundred free lunches were provided. Thus both the spiritual and the physical needs were amply taken care of, and all went home with joy and thanksgiving, determined to press the battle to the gate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Warning and Witness in Glasgow and London </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By M. A. Howlett</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font8">T IS becoming more clearly apparent that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is desperately trying to gain control of the British Empire. In Scotland, the home of sturdy and vigorous Protestants of bygone years, there is now very little protest. Within the last few years the Hierarchy has made rapid strides. Glasgow, one of the largest cities in Scotland, is now a stronghold of Catholic Action. Under the circumstances, what was more fitting than that a warning be delivered and a witness given in that city?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From July 31 to August 3, 1936, there gathered in convention in Glasgow about 3,500 of Jehovah’s witnesses. The main feature of the convention was the public witness. The speaker was Judge Rutherford; his timely topic, “Arma</span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">geddon.” So great was the interest stirred up by the extensive advertising that it was quickly seen there was no single hall large enough to accommodate those who wanted to hear this topic discussed. Judge Rutherford has always been listened to with much interest in Glasgow, but never with greater enthusiasm than on this occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The largest available auditorium, the Coliseum, was first obtained. It became apparent a second hall would be necessary. The Bedford, a close-by cinema theater was procured. The speech was advertised well in advance. The people of Glasgow began to talk and make inquiries, until it was seen a third hall would be necessary, and so the City Grand Hall was obtained. Never before has Glasgow had such a public witness.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Publishers Did Their Own Advertising</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">One most noticeable and remarkable fact was that the entire campaign of advertising this important speech was conducted by Jehovah’s witnesses themselves. On the two days of Saturday and Sunday, immediately preceding the big public witness, over a hundred automobiles paraded through the city constantly with large placards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Groups of Jehovah’s people themselves, ranging from thirty, fifty, seventy-five, and up to a hundred, paraded as ‘‘sandwich men”, going through the streets of Glasgow, thus calling attention to the important message to be delivered. Nearly a thousand of such witnesses participated in this means of advertising the Kingdom message. The hundreds of thousands of people in the busy streets of Glasgow were greatly impressed with the zeal of the Kingdom publishers. The Hierarchy got busy, the “Catholic population” was warned not to attend this meeting. As a result many hundreds of honest Catholics came. Satan thus overreached himself. Two hours before the Coliseum opened its doors a queue began to form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Three thousand two hundred filled the auditorium to overflowing in a few minutes; others hurried to the Bedford adjoining. Two thousand one hundred packed out this theater very quickly. Still the crowds came. Eighteen hundred walked a matter of many blocks to the City Grand Hall, filling that, and many w’ere unable to obtain admission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Judge Rutherford spoke in the Coliseum, and his speech was carried by the British Post Office telephone lines to the Bedford and the City Grand Hall; thus the 7,100 people who were able to obtain admission listened eagerly to the message of warning delivered at that time.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Glasgow Took the Message to Heart</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The speaker, in plain, simple, easily understood language, made it clear that to all people of good will the message would bring hope, comfort and consolation, and yet at the same time a warning would have to be declared placing the responsibility squarely upon the shoulders of those who were opposing the kingdom of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was shown that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy was the most powerful agent ever used by Satan to besmirch the name of Jehovah, and to actually turn the people away from serving Jehovah God. It was apparent that the major portion of the audience were happy to hear the message of Jehovah’s Word so clearly, forcefully and fearlessly declared. They whistled, they stamped, they clapped, they shouted. This was the grandest witness Scotland had ever had.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One honest Catholic was heard to say: “I’m a Catholic. I was always led to believe that Judge Rutherford was a faker. Tonight I came here prejudiced, but I thank the Lord I have my eyes open now. That man has done more good here in the city of Glasgow tonight than the Orangemen have done in the last twenty-five years.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another honest Catholic approached one of Jehovah’s witnesses and said: “I’m sorry to admit it, but I burned the books of Judge Rutherford’s I had at the advice of the priest. After hearing that message tonight, I want to know where I can procure all the judge has written, so that I may learn how to take my stand on the side of Jehovah and His kingdom.” Her face shone; she was happy. There were many such expressions. Glasgow will remember that witness.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Kingdom Publishers' Convention at London</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">On Sunday, September 13, the message of warning was again delivered, this time in London. Alexandra Palace is a huge auditorium, comfortably seating ten thousand people. Through the means of a modern system of amplification, employing a large number of speakers, run at low level, the speech could be heard perfectly in every part of the auditorium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Again Judge Rutherford delivered his stirring message, warning the people of the British Isles of the approach of “Armageddon”. Emphasis was laid on the fact that for many centuries a great organization with its headquarters in Vatican City had spread its God-dishonoring doctrines of “religion” into practically every country of earth. Clearly it was shown the striking difference between religion and Christianity. The audience of approximately 12,000, some of whom were served by powerful loud-speakers on the outside of the building, quickly caught the point of distinction made by the speaker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Englishmen are more or less conservative in their expression, but as the various points were clearly made, the enthusiasm mounted high and thunderous applause greeted each point. The seething caldron of unrest in Central Europe is giving much concern to all thinking people; especially was this apparent at the Alexandra Palace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the speaken showed from the Scriptures and the physical facts that the great Roman Catholic Hierarchy was behind all this disturbance and that the Hierarchy was spreading its tentacles into the various departments of the British Empire, all English conservatism was thrown aside and the whole audience clapped and cheered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Once more the great metropolis of the British Empire had the message of warning. The appeal was made for all people of good will to forsake the organizations of hypocritical religion and take their stand on the side of Jehovah and His kingdom. London can never plead ignorance of the coming Battle of Armageddon. The warning has been delivered.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">At the conclusion of the London convention the vast audience adopted unanimously the resolution below:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">RESOLUTION-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(Unanimously adopted at London)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah’s witnesses now assembled at London, the capital city of the seventh world power, there to worship Jehovah in spirit and in truth, take this occasion to give thanks to the Almighty God, whose name alone is Jehovah, for His manifold blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Knowing full well that Jehovah God always faithfully performs His promise, and that long centuries ago He promised He would establish on earth His kingdom of righteousness with Christ Jesus as the world’s rightful Ruler; and now seeing from the fulfillment of prophecy that the day of Jehovah’s kingdom is here, we rejoice in the privilege of being His servants and His witnesses and we do declare our unqualified allegiance to the Almighty God and His kingdom and we delight to make known to suffering humankind that the kingdom of God under Christ is their only hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We fully appreciate that Satan the Devil is the great enemy of all who serve Jehovah God, and that Satan has used and still uses religionists as his agencies to oppose and persecute those who worship God in spirit and in truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The law of Jehovah God is supreme, which should be obeyed by all persons, and by His grace we will obey the law of Jehovah God, and not the law of man when such is contrary to God’s law’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We direct attention to the clear distinction between religion and Christianity. Religion is a form of worship based upon the traditions of men, which forms of worship Satan has caused men to adopt and teach, thereby deceiving and misleading millions of sincere persons. Christianity is the true worship of Almighty God by keeping or obeying His commandments. We delight to declare ourselves the followers of Christ Jesus and that we are therefore Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In obedience to God’s law as written at Ezekiel thirty-three and other places in the Bible, we sound the warning concerning His purpose to destroy all the wicked and those who willfully violate His law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">True to and in fulfillment of Jehovah’s prophecy there has arisen and yet exists in the world a powerful religious organization with its headquarters at Vatican City, Italy, and which designates itself as the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and which official body rules, dominates and misleads millions of sincere persons, who by it are designated as ‘ ‘ the Catholic population ’ ’, but which persons are not members of the so-called “Catholic church’’. That aforesaid religious organization falsely claims to be a Christian organization, whereas in truth and in fact it is a political organization, against the kingdom of God under Christ. Contrary to the Word of God the Roman Catholic Hierarchy participates in the political affairs of all nations of earth and desperately attempts to rule all nations by cruel dictators. Their methods today are the same as employed by that organization during the wicked Inquisition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We call all good people to witness that in Germany, Austria and other places Jehovah’s witnesses and true worshipers of Almighty God are cruelly persecuted, imprisoned, fiendishly abused and many of them killed, and that all such wickedness and persecution is done against them by a cruel, malicious, wicked power, incited so to do by religionists, led by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. It is now boldly announced by the public press that the Hitler government and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy are in full accord. The Hitler government, aided and incited by said religious organization, has inflicted and continues to inflict all manner of cruel punishment upon Christians, even as Christ Jesus and His apostles were persecuted for righteousness ’ sake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God has commanded His servants to proclaim His waining, that full responsibility may rest upon the wicked for their wrongdoing; and for that reason we now sound the warning to the rulers in Germany and in other places, and particularly to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and to all like organizations that cruelly persecute the true and faithful followers of Christ Jesus and who oppose the publication of Jehovah’s kingdom message. God declares that the fate of such wicked ones is complete destruction. (Psahn 145: 20) Jesus Christ has declared that He counts His faithful followers a part of himself, and at Matthew twenty-five He pronounces Jehovah’s judgment against those who persecute the true followers of Christ Jesus, employing these words: ‘ Inasmuch as ye have done it to [cruelly ill-treated] the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his angels. These shall go into everlasting destruction. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We vigorously protest against the cruel treatment of Jehovah’s witnesses by the Boman Catholic Hierarchy and its allies in Germany and in all other parts of the world, but we are delighted to leave the end thereof entirely in the hand of the Almighty God, who, according to His Word, will render to them a full recompense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We call attention to the indisputable truth that the world’s greatest crisis is at the door, and we sound the warning to all mankind according to God's Word that those who would live must refuse to give aid and support to religionists who oppose Jehovah’s kingdom and persecute the true followers of Christ Jesus, and that they must take their stand on the side of righteousness and give heed to and obey the words of Jehovah God, to wit: ‘Behold my servant, whom I have chosen . . . He shall show judgment to the nations . . . And in His name shall the nations hope. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As the followers of Christ Jesus we have no part in and no interest in the political affairs of this world. Our sole purpose and commission is to make known the name and the kingdom of God under Christ, that the people may be informed and intelligently choose whom they will serve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">W’e send loving greetings to our persecuted brethren in Germany and other parts of the earth, and bid them to be of good courage and to rely solely upon the promises of the Almighty God Jehovah, and Christ, and to remember the words of Jesus: ‘ Shall not God avenge His own elect </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font5"> He will avenge them speedily’ (Luke 18:7,8); and, further, to give heed to the words of the Lord Jesus addressed to His faithful servants: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.” (Revelation 2: 10) Blessed is the lot of those who are permitted to endure all manner of suffering for the sake of the name of Jehovah and His kingdom under Christ.—Matthew 5: 10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The everlasting peace, joy and life of the people depend entirely upon the great “Prince of Peace”, whose government will be administered in peace and righteousness.—Isaiah 9: 6, 7; 32: 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Resolved that a copy of this resolution be sent to Mr. Hitler and to the pope at Vatican City as the head of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and be freely published throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">September 13, 1936.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A Belated Third Report of the European Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations.” Jehovah’s witnesses are to be found everywhere fulfilling this commission. No matter in what country the witness is being given; no matter what language is used, the same spirit of earnest zeal is seen. Judge Rutherford was greatly used by Jehovah to give probably the most effective public witness and warning yet given in some of the European countries. Great opposition was manifested by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, but to no avail. The physical facts are so clearly seen today that Armageddon is rapidly approaching, that there is no excuse for slacking the hand in this day of battle. Jehovah’s witnesses in the European countries are not so favorably situated as in America. The countries there are comparatively small and hemmed in by very strict national and international regulations. This applies particularly to such countries as Germany, Austria, Bavaria. In the British Isles freedom of speech has always been the heritage of the people, but this is likely to be taken away shortly. Scotland used to be the home of sturdy Protestants, but, like all other countries, is being gradually invaded by “the great harlot”, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, as she seeks to seduce every country under the sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Within the last decade, the city of Glasgow has increased its “Catholic population” until now there are as many Catholics as Protestants. Judge Rutherford delivered the message of warning in that city on August 2, 1936. So great was the interest that it required three auditoriums to hold the people that came. “Armageddon” was the subject used, and the message was received with greater enthusiasm than at any other time in Scotland. Over 7,000 people crowded into the auditoriums, and many were unable to gain admission. Of course, the Hierarchy was busy warning its “population” not to attend the meeting, but this only served to make a large number of honest Catholics come. They came, and many were the expressions of disgust with the priests as these honest Catholics saw they had been hoodwinked by that wicked bunch. One Catholic woman said she had previously burned the books of Judge Rutherford because her priest had told her to, but after she heard the witness she wanted everything she could get hold of, so that she might learn how to take her stand on the side of Jehovah. Jehovah’s witnesses attending the convention in Glasgow threw themselves into advertising the big public witness. Over 1,000 participated in the “sandwich” parades. Groups of witnesses, in numbers of 35 up to 100 in a group, walked up and down the busy streets of Glasgow announcing in this very effective way the public meeting. Over one hundred autos covered the city and outlying districts with banners and placards. On Sunday, September 13, 1936, London was awakened to the fact and warned of the near approach of Armageddon. Jehovah’s witnesses moved on that city from all parts of the country. About 3,000 joined in publicizing the big witness. Here, too, over a thousand joined in the “sandwich board” parades. People were greatly impressed with the unusual sight of seeing quiet, earnest, cleanly dressed men and women, with happy smiling faces, calling their attention to the coming witness in the Alexandra Palace in this unique way. Strange, but none ridiculed; many, however, said they were glad to see some people with the courage of their convictions. Crowds came to the Alexandra Palace; some got in, many heard on the outside. Powerful loud-speakers served from the roof of the building. The speaker’s voice was thus carried a great distance from the Palace into the densely populated area. It would be impossible to estimate how many people heard in this way. A mighty shout also went up when the audience of approximately 12,000 joined in lustily shouting “Aye”, at the conclusion of the reading of a resolution calling for all people of good will to take a firm stand on the side of Jehovah and His kingdom. Never has Great Britain had such a witness in two of its largest cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Switzerland is the oldest republic in existence, being over a thousand years old. On beautiful Lake Lucerne, nestling between the towering peaks of the Swiss Alps, lies the ancient city of Lucerne. It was on the shores of this lake, within a short distance of the city, where William Tell, of ‘the arrow and apple’ fame, made his bold bid for freedom from the oppressive yoke of a kingdom dominated by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. At that time the Swiss republic was established. On September 4, 1936, there gathered in this beautiful and historic city a convention of Jehovah’s witnesses. On Monday, September 7, there was to be a large public witness. Quiet, earnest, happy and determined came over 3,500 publishers of the Kingdom message, from twenty-one different countries. One motive, one thought, dominated all: the honoring of the name of the great Jehovah and His King, Christ Jesus. Some had traveled far on foot; others had come a journey of many days on bicycles. Many endured great hardships to get there. One Kingdom publisher, a cripple, hardly able to walk, and poor in this world’s goods, propelled himself in his wheel chair over the country roads a distance of nearly 200 miles; but he got there. And was he happy! This cripple was from Germany. Nearly 300 Jehovah’s witnesses and Jonadabs. courageously journeyed across the German border into Switzerland in the face of the possibility of arrest and imprisonment in a concentration camp. There were those of many languages in Lucerne, but only one mind pervaded the whole. Satan came also, as he usually does.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A large municipal building housed the convention. Here was to be the large public witness. The &quot;harlot” got busy. She began to allure and seduee the police officials. Lucerne is mostly Catholic. Catholics have votes; police officials need votes to keep them in office. And so the &quot;whore” prevailed. Judge Rutherford was served with a notice from the city president that arrest would follow any attempt to hold the meeting. Judge Rutherford in turn served notice personally upon the president that he would be at the auditorium at eight o’clock that evening and that the meeting would be held. He placed the responsibility of any trouble squarely upon the shoulders of this city official. Two hours before the meeting the hall was packed. A large crowd gathered outside. The police came and surrounded the building with the purpose of keeping the people out, but the auditorium was filled long before the police got there. Judge Rutherford stepped to the platform on time and a tremendous applause rang out. The people wanted to hear the message. As the message was carried to the outside through loud-speakers placed in the lobby of the auditorium, the crowds there cheered and shouted &quot;Bravo! Bravo! ” Needless to say, it was clearly pointed out who was behind this attempted stopping of the witness; and from the comments heard throughout the entire audience it was seen that an even greater witness had been effected. Satan always overreaches himself. Jehovah always prevails. Some few disgruntled ones on the outside demanded that the police officer in charge have the loud-speakers shut off that were serving the people on the outside. The officer said: &quot;I have no authority to do any such thing. I am only here to carry out the orders I have. That speaker can stay on just as long as it likes; I’m not going to touch it ”; and he said this with a smile. Copies of the Resolution were handed out to the police who were forming a cordon around the building, and many read it with much interest. A more docile-looking bunch of men could not be found. Most of them were ashamed to be there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon Judge Rutherford, and never was he heard to greater advantage. This was undoubtedly the grandest witness ever given in this day. ‘ ‘ The Sword of Jehovah and of Gideon” was the battle shout. ‘We ask no quarter; we give no quarter. There shall be no compromise,’ was the theme of the whole convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A public witness was also delivered in the capital cities of Scandinavia. Copenhagen in Denmark, Stockholm in Sweden, Oslo in Norway, and Helsingfors in Finland, received the Kingdom message. A representative of the Society visited these countries and delivered the message of ‘ ‘ Separating the Nations” contained in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Choosing</span><span class="font5"> booklet. Great interest was manifested, and much literature placed, showing a definite division now taking place among the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Judicial Insanity in Chicago</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HE flag-saluting cult is again on the job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Not satisfied with expelling children from school, sentencing them to public institutions, choking, beating and maltreating them, it has now branched out to broader fields. It has taken on adults, and proposes to do great things in support of its idol.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mary Schlachetka, one of Jehovah's witnesses, was fined by Judge Joseph Hermes of the Women’s Court, 1121 South State St., Chicago, the sum of $200 with $10 costs on a charge of disorderly conduct. The disorderly conduct consisted in refusing to salute the flag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is evident that the members of the “salute or go to jail” denomination are insane. Insanity has been defined as a disease of the mind which causes a person not to know the nature or quality of the act he is doing. They say much about preserving liberty and respect for the flag, but their minds are so warped, and tw’isted with devotion to their patriotic ritual, that they cannot see they are desecrating the principles of freedom for which the flag of America has stood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Judge Hermes’ decision puts him in the class of the Massachusetts judge that sentenced three children to a reformatory because they dared to adhere to the Scriptures, Exodus 20:3-5, and stand upon their rights, acknowledged by the fundamental law<sup>T</sup> of every state in the Union and of the United States itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Judge Hermes may get a little cheap publicity out of the Hearst rags, and kindred soilers of paper pulp, but he should see what the reputable press of the United States thinks of that Massachusetts episode. It will not be long now before it is in the hands of the readers of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font8"> They would have had it long ago, but too many other things pressed for space.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Judge Hermes would have been a good tool for the inquisitors a few hundred years ago, and will doubtless be a good one for the inquisitors that are even now straining at their leashes and yelping in chorus to get at their prey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Just as sure as the descending sun gives evidence that the darkness of night is close at hand, so do the actions of the flag-saluting sect supported by decisions of judges like Judge Hermes prove that the liberties of the American people are fast going into oblivion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The usual custom has been to lock up the insane people in places where they cannot injure anybody. Now it appears that the crazy ones are going to run and boss the world for a while.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Madame Liberty is in for a tough time. Her statue in New York harbor will probably serve as a grave-marker, soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Judge Rutherford’s Testimony at the Harbeck Trial at Berne</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Boris Todtli, Gewerbestrasse 31, Bern, represented by the undersigned lawyer,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Complainant, </span><span class="font8">against</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">1. Mr. M. C. Harbeck, Allmendstrasse 39, Bern, 2. Mr. Franz Zurcher, Allmendstrasse 39, Bern, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Defendants, </span><span class="font8">to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Richteramt IV of Bern :</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. President:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">By permission of the Court J. F. Rutherford makes the following statement under oath:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I am a resident of Brooklyn, New York, United States of America; I am the writer of some of the literature concerning which the accused are charged; I am president of the organization with which the accused are associated and represent, the work of which organization is devoted to the preaching of the gospel as commanded by the Lord and which is for the benefit of the people. That this learned Court might have a better view of the matter pertaining to the accusations laid against Messrs. Harbeck and Zurcher, and the work in which they are engaged, the following statement, by the permission of the Court, is made:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I am a native-born American citizen of Scotch parentage, and am in no wise related to the Hebrew people. I have nothing in common with or nothing against any person because he is a Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Organization : Three legally constituted corporations operate together and are, to wit: the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, organized under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania; the Peoples Pulpit Association, organized under the laws of the State of New York; and the International Bible Students Association, incorporated under the laws of Great Britain. I am and since 1917 have been the president of these corporations. Said incorporated organizations operate as publishers of Jehovah’s witnesses, the latter name meaning all persons who are wholly devoted to the Almighty God and to Christ Jesus. For more than sixty years this organization has carried forward its Christian work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The sole purpose of the organization represented here by the accused is to aid the people to gain a knowledge of the Holy Scriptures, and that free from all prejudice, and to this end its publications appear, to wit, in seventy languages and dialects, and its operations extend throughout the nations of the earth. It has no desire and makes no effort whatsoever to participate in the political affairs of the nations of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Money : The money to carry forward the work of this Christian organization is supplied by the voluntary contributions made by persons who are unselfishly and deeply interested in the enlightenment and uplift of the human race. No money has ever been contributed by or received from any person who is a Jew and used to carry on this work. The charge that the organization and its work is financed by Jews is entirely false and made without any excuse or justification. Teachings : It is charged that the accused Harbeck and Zurcher distributed “trash literature”, which is in violation of the law, and which literature is published by the aforesaid organization. The charge is utterly false and without any foundation in fact. The organization, as shown by its literature distributed, does not adopt or follow the teachings of any man. It publishes the teachings of the Holy Scriptures only. In brief, the Scripture teaching, as promulgated by the literature distributed, is:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That the Creator of heaven and earth, the supreme power of the universe, is the Almighty God, the Most High, whose name alone is Jehovah; that Christ Jesus is the Son of God, and the Chief One of Jehovah’s great organization, and that Jehovah and Christ Jesus together constitute the “Higher Powers” as that term is used in the Scriptures; that all true followers of Christ Jesus are servants of Jehovah God and commissioned and commanded by Jehovah to bear testimony to the people (Isaiah 61:1,2), and therefore these people are properly and Scripturally called Jehovah’s witnesses. (Isaiah 43:10-12) Christ Jesus is the great “Faithful and True Witness” of Jehovah God, and He declares that every one who is of the truth is obedient to the commandments of the Lord. Christ Jesus being the first and the head of Jehovah’s great organization, He became the founder of Christianity more than 1900 years ago, and the term “Christian” is properly applied only to those who are the true and faithful followers of Christ Jesus, obeying God’s commandments as Jesus obeyed. The organization of which the accused are a part is not against, but wholly for Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is a wide distinction between religion</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">and Christianity, and that distinction is made clear by the words of Christ Jesus as appear below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Religion consists of any teaching and formalism practiced and based upon the traditions of men, and which recognize some deity or superior power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Christianity is based solely upon the commandments of the Almighty God, Jehovah. The Jewish clergy of old designated in the Scriptures as scribes and Pharisees were duty-bound to obey God’s commandments, but they abandoned His commandments and substituted therefor the traditions of men. Those clergymen approached Jesus and said to Him: “Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? . . . But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandments of God by your tradition? . , . Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.” (Matthew 15:1-6) Any religion that is named “Christian religion” is improperly named. There are many religions. There is but one Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many centuries before the coming of Jesus Christ to the earth the Devil organized religion with Nimrod as the chief visible one, and which religion defamed God’s holy name. Thereafter various heathen nations organized or adopted a religion to suit their desires, all of which were against the Almighty God. The nation of Israel, although bound by covenant to obey God’s commandment and to avoid intercourse with the heathen nations because of the religion of the heathen, yet openly abandoned God’s commandments and adopted a religion based upon the traditions of men, and for that reason the nation of Israel was destroyed. Everywhere in the Bible God expresses himself as against religion because it tends to turn the people away from Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was the religious Jews that opposed and persecuted Christ Jesus, and for that reason He told them that they were the children of the Devil, thus clearly establishing the author of “religion”. (John 8: 42-44) Paul, once known as Saul, practiced the Jews’ religion and persecuted Christians; but when God revealed to him the truth and he became a Christian he immediately turned about and served God in spirit and in truth. -His own testimony upon this point is conclusive: “For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it; and profited in the Jews’ religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers. But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called me by his grace, to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood.” —Galatians 1:13-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And while he was practicing the Jews’ religion Paul was never persecuted, but when he became a Christian he was violently persecuted by the religious Jews because he told the people the truth. Jesus foretold that all His true followers would be persecuted by religionists; and it has ever been thus.—John 15:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sometime after the death of the apostles of Jesus Christ a religious organization came into existence, and which is called Catholic. That religious organization is governed and controlled by a small body of men designated as the “Roman Catholic Hierarchy”, while all the people that support that organization are called “the Catholic population”, and such people are not members of the Catholic church organization. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy claims to serve God and Christ Jesus, but in fact it has long been a political and commercial organization as well as religious. It has improperly carved and applied to itself the term “Christian religion”, whereas in truth and in fact there is no such thing in existence as the “Christian religion”. The terms “religion” and “Christianity” are diametrically opposed one to the other, but the people in general are kept in ignorance of this important fact. Jehovah’s witnesses are not against Christianity or Christians, but, on the contrary, are the true advocates of Christianity, which means the teaching of and obedience to the commandments of Jehovah God. It is the Word of God as taught by Christ Jesus and His apostles that exposes the duplicity and hypocrisy of organizations that practice religion. God declared that His due time would come to expose the fallacy of religion and let the people know the truth of and concerning himself and His name; and that time has now come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses have no fight against anyone. They are wholly for God and His kingdom. They are engaged in publishing the truth of God’s Word as set forth in the Bible, and as God has commanded, and it is the truth of God’s Word that exposes hypocrisy, fraud and deceit, and makes known that Satan is the arch enemy of God and of man and that Satan uses men to organize and carry on in the name of Christ a work that deceives the people and keeps them in ignorance of Jehovah God and His purpose to give obedient men a great blessing through His kingdom. Only God’s enemies could desire to hide the truth from the people. It is because Jehovah’s witnesses teach the truth that they stand accused in this Court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pictures : A picture is a means of conveying to the mind by sight what is stated more in detail by words. Long ago Jehovah God by His prophecies made many word pictures thereby foretelling what should come to pass in future days. Among those prophetic pictures God disclosed that a great religious organization would become political and commercial and would resort to all manner of means and wrongful practices to carry out its purposes. Said word pictures also disclosed that the Devil is back of and the author of such wrongful organizations and practices. A picture in the book cited by complainants, and appearing at pages 96-97 of Book One, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font8"> is an example in point. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy exactly fits the word picture given in God’s Book and the picture or illustration published as here cited. It is a well-known fact that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy participates in the politics of every nation and attempts to control all the political offices. That organization has long been known as commercial and as such has accumulated a great mass of property and money and many of its cathedrals contain guns and ammunition. Surely it cannot be claimed that these things have been done for the purpose of teaching the people the plain and life-giving words of Jesus Christ, but have been done and are being done for other reasons. The picture represents religion, Big Business or selfish commercialism, and unrighteous politics. The record of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is smeared with human blood unrighteously shed. It is only necessary to refer to the many historical statements concerning the wicked Inquisition carried on by the Hierarchy, in which many people were cruelly put to death by burning at the stake and by other wicked means. It is a well-known fact that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is now supporting and pushing forward the revolution that is in progress in Spain and that such revolutionists are committing many ruthless and cruel acts. In Germany many persons have been wrongfully killed at the instigation of religionists. The garment worn by the priest, as shown in the picture and in which also he wears a hat similiar to that worn by the priest of the heathen fishgod Dagon, is exactly in keeping with the facts, and upon the skirts of that garment appears human blood. Without a doubt Jehovah God had in mind that very same thing when He caused His prophet to write these words: “Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.” (Jeremiah 2: 34) The picture therefore is true to the word picture given by Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The illustration or picture in Book Two, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font8"> page 109, concerning Revelation 17:16 is exactly in harmony with the word picture of the Scriptures. This false organization practicing religion the Lord in His Word refers to as a “whore”, manifestly meaning that the organization claiming to worship God indulges in illicit relationship with the political element of the world. (James 4:4) The Lord also declares in His Word that He will put it into the minds of the kings to destroy that wicked organization, and it seems quite apparent that God is now permitting the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to make such an exhibition of itself and its cruel practices before the kings or rulers of the earth that they will soon clearly see her hypocrisy and then carry out God’s will as He has expressed it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Every picture in the publications under consideration is fully supported by the Word of God, and without a question of doubt these things the Lord God caused to be written and published that the people might be enlightened. The pictures are not published for the purpose of holding up to ridicule any person or inciting them to wrongdoing, but for the purpose of portraying the truth as the truth appears in the Holy Scriptures, and that in order that the people might be properly warned according to the commandments of Almighty God and that the people might learn the worship of Almighty God in spirit and in truth as He has commanded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If the publications embraced in the charges are “trash literature”, as charged, the Word of Almighty God is “trash literature”. Such a conclusion is wholly unreasonable. It is manifest that the lawmakers had no intention to forbid the distribution of the Holy Scriptures or a published explanation of the same. These publications contain the truth and nothing but the truth; and, said the Lord Jesus Christ: ‘Sanctify them with thy truth; thy Word is truth.’ —John 17:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Motive : The complainants Todtli and his supporter Fleischhauer by the very words of their accusation or complaint show that they are wholly ignorant of the Scriptures and the meaning thereof and that they have no faith or confidence therein. Their charges that the literature published is “trash literature” is too absurd and ridiculous to merit serious consideration, and this Court should not be wearied by having to wade through their diatribe. Their complaint shows that they are moved by malice, hatred, ill will, and that they have no idea or intention of rendering any good service to the people. That those men, the complainants, are the agents and representatives of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, seems certain. They are not interested in the publications that do good to mankind. Their purpose is to put to silence all publications of truth in order that the people might be kept in ignorance of God’s kingdom, and while the religio-political organization, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, pushes its campaign to gain control of all the nations of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In support of this statement I refer the Court to a book written by E. Boyd Barrett entitled </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Rome Stoops to Conquer.</span><span class="font8"> Mr. Barrett for many years was a Jesuit and is fully acquainted with the methods of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and speaks with authority. His book discloses that the Hierarchy resorts to all manner of underhanded and wrongful schemes to gain control of the governments of the earth. I ask to file a copy of that book as apart of my testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The publication of the truth of God’s Word, which foretells the arising into power of just such political-religious organization as the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, greatly angers men of the Hierarchy, and for this reason they persecute and lie about the publishers of the truth. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy is now carrying on a systematic underhanded and cruel persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses in Canada, in America, Australia, Austria, Japan, Germany, and in many other countries, and the sole reason for such persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses is because they publish the truth of God's Word as He has commanded that the truth shall be published and because the truth is enlightening and beneficial to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Complainants state that I was imprisoned during the World War, but complainants are careful not to disclose all the truth of and concerning the same. It was the religious clergy, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, that entered into a conspiracy and carried out that conspiracy, to frame and did frame false charges against me, and my brethren in Christ Jesus, and caused us to be imprisoned upon false charges of hindering the prosecution of the War. Their real purpose was to rid the earth of those who preached the gospel of God’s kingdom under Christ Jesus. By reason of the influence of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the Roman Catholic judge of the court denied us bail bond and we were held in prison for nine months illegally, at the end of which time the Supreme Court of the United States heard the matter, admitted us to bail, and then the government dismissed all charges against us, and thereby the clergy were greatly chagrined and their purpose defeated. They now attempt to use their own wrongful acts to besmirch and destroy the influence of others who are giving their lives for doing good to mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If the books written by me do not disclose the truth, then why do not the clergy come before the public and openly discuss the matter and tell them wherein these publications are not true? I have heretofore challenged the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and other clergymen to select any man they may choose who will take their side and defend their position in a public debate of these Bible questions. They refuse. Millions of people of the United States have signed a petition calling upon the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to defend their side in an open debate with me, and they continue to remain silent. Are they and their agents at all interested in aiding the people to understand the truth and to do for them that which will be a benefit to the people ? Manifestly not. They refuse to tell the truth, and attempt to throttle all others and thus prevent the truth being told. They thereby make manifest that they are public enemies. For many centuries the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has promulgated false doctrines, cruelly misrepresented and defamed the name and Word of Almighty God, and Christ Jesus, and now they would prevent people from gaining a knowledge of the truth by any possible means. Being unable to make defense of their own position before the people they resort to the law in an attempt to prevent the publication of the truth of God’s Word. In the language of the Scriptures they “frame mischief by law”, and God declares that for so doing He will destroy them: “Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law? They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood. And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">off</span><span class="font8"> in their own wickedness; yea, the Lord our God shall cut them off.”— Psalm 94:20, 21,23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kingdom : Complainants claim that the accused and their associates are trying to establish a world government. That statement not only is false, but is ridiculous. Complainants thereby also show that they have no knowledge of and no faith in God’s Word concerning His righteous government and that therefore they are against God and His kingdom. No man on this earth, whether a Christian or otherwise, will establish a righteous government; but without a question of doubt God will establish such a righteous government through Christ Jesus, because He says: “I have purposed it, I will also do it.” (Isaiah 46:11) The publications in question emphasize and proclaim the plain teachings of the Holy Scriptures concerning the establishment of God’s government of righteousness to His glory and for the benefit of obedient men. Jehovah promised that He would set up such a righteous government on earth under His King, Christ Jesus. The Lord Jesus when on earth taught His followers to pray always: ‘Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as in heaven.’ And every Christian does thus pray. The time is here when the people must be informed of God’s purpose to set up His righteous government of which government Christ Jesus is the Head and concerning which Jehovah God says: “The government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end.” (Isaiah 9: 6, 7) “Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.” (Isaiah 32:1) The people of every nation are now in distress and perplexity and God calls their attention to His kingdom and points to Christ Jesus the Head thereof and says to them: “In his name shall the nations hope.” (Matthew 12: 21) The Lord commands His wit</span><span class="font8">nesses to go forth and publish these truths to the people and to warn them in order that the people might have opportunity to know of and seek the way of righteousness. I cite the following scriptures to show that every true Christian must obey this commandment of the Lord to publish the truth and to warn the people, and the failure to do so would result in his own destruction.—Matthew 24:14; Acts 3: 23; Ezekiel 33:7-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The accused and their associates are not asking the people to join some organization. They are not seeking or receiving members; they are not attempting any injury to any person. Their responsibility is to proclaim and publish the truth as commanded because it is the Lord’s will. The law of Jehovah God is supreme, and is above the law of man, and all who are in a covenant to do His will must obey God’s law and His commandments, and this they delight to do. In doing so they call down upon their heads the opposition and cruel persecution of God’s enemies. In obedience to Jehovah’s commandments the accused and others of Jehovah’s witnesses go forth and publish the truth to the people that the people may be warned and that they may find a place of refuge, which God has prepared for them, and that they may receive His blessings. Nothing could be of greater importance and aid to the people than this. It remains for Fleischhauer and Todtli to denounce these publications as “trash literature”. Their charges are not worthy of serious consideration by honest men. They show that they have no faith in God and in Christ Jesus and no knowledge or understanding of His Word. They have not hesitated to resort to falsehood. They have quoted isolated passages from the publications entirely out of their setting, for the very purpose of causing a misunderstanding. They show that they are void of honesty and truthfulness. When they come into Court claiming to act upon a high plane they should come with clean hands. On the contrary, their hands are dripping with unrighteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Regardless of the false and malicious charges made against the accused here and others, and regardless of the cruel opposition set up by these men and their principal, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the good news of Jehovah God and His Kingdom under Christ Jesus will continue to be preached, because it is the will of God that it shall be told to the people and His will must be done. The only hope for the people is that they may know and rely upon the Word of God and obey His commandments. The publications in question, therefore, are of the highest importance for the well-being of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Berne, August 21, 1936.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Instilling “Love of Liberty” in Minds of the Youth of Maryland</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">C</span><span class="font8">HAPTER 239 of the laws of Maryland provides for patriotic programs including the salute to the flag, in order that “love of liberty and democracy may be instilled in the minds of the youth of America”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Because they loved God and would not disobey His commandments, six children of Albert Ludke refused to participate in the flag-salute ceremony in Oxon Hill schools. The teachers were disturbed and the school board was disturbed. At first they were inclined to respect the views of the children. They had some faint idea that it might interfere with religious freedom, and knew that it certainly wouldn’t help instill “love of liberty and democracy” in the hearts of the children to expel them from school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The American Legion claims to be a patriotic organization. It claims to have great “love of liberty and democracy”. Because some of its members fought in war, it has placed itself on a high mount of self-esteem, where it would fain oversee all things, dictate all things, and be all things. Without any conception of what constitutes liberty or democracy some of its members and posts have made themselves ridiculous trying to force the “love of liberty and democracy” in the minds of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From their high point of self-approbation, self-glorification, self-sufficiency and natural-born conceitedness, a few of the Maryland Legion posts observed what was happening in the Oxon Hill schools, and immediately decided, without invitation, to inject themselves into the affair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Marlboro Post No. 115 was the first on the job. The members gave deep thought to the matter. They gathered data on the legal powers of the school board. They didn’t gather any data on the right of school children to worship God in accordance with the dictates of conscience. They didn’t consider that necessary. All they desired was to find legal support to punish these children. They held special meetings and indulged in much discussion. Plans were drafted and finally they demanded action. The law must be enforced. The children had to ‘love liberty and democracy’ or go without an education. Democracy and liberty were being endangered by these youngsters, and Marlboro Post No. 115 was going to see that something was done about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Treasury Post No. 35 also horned in for the preservation of “liberty and democracy”. This post recommended that the Department of Maryland take corrective action to inform the parents of the duty to respect the flag. Just what “corrective action” should be taken was not disclosed, but it sounds and smells like an inquisitional process to jam a little “love of liberty and democracy” down the throats of the parents.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>School Board Surrenders Its Patriotism</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The county school board was in a dilemma. The Ludke children were good pupils. They rated above the average in scholarship. They were well behaved and obedient. The board had intelligence enough to see that the denial of educational privileges would not help in teaching them patriotism. The board could also see that they might receive much criticism if they expelled the pupils. They might get a panning from the newspapers. But on the other hand, if they permitted them to remain in school, there would be the American Legion from its Olympic heights thundering complaints, threats and anathemas at them. Like as not they would be called “Reds” and “Communists”. In their distress the board members shivered and shuddered, and wished not to be disturbed by these problems of “liberty and democracy”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Finally they submitted to the demands of the un-American American Legion. They gave up their patriotism, trampled on freedom of worship and conscience, and made “liberty and democracy” look “like what the cat dragged home”. (Apologies to “Harvey”) They served notice that children who obey the commandments of Almighty God in refusing to worship the image of the nation cannot attend the public schools of Prince Georges county.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Residents of Prince Georges county, take a good look at your county school board. Observe the invertebrate and obsequious creatures you have placed in charge of your educational institutions. Then put on your garments of mourning and weep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The board guessed correctly as to what might happen. Plenty of criticism was soon to be their portion. Many people did not believe their action to be a good educational process for instilling “love of liberty and democracy” in the hearts of school children. Many thought a gross injustice had been perpetrated. Some newspapers spoke freely and courageously criticizing the school board for following the spirit of Nazism, Fascism and autocracy in place of the American spirit of liberty and freedom, and for wrongfully interfering .with freedom of worship and freedom of conscience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Something had to be done; so once more we see those helpful interpolators of un-Americanism appearing from their pragmatical heights to render aid, comfort, sustenance and assistance to the flag-worshiping cult and the school board. Takoma Post No. 28, on August 13, 1936, adopted a resolution. It contained twelve “Whereases” and two “Resolves”, and was just full of information and advice, especially advice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The newspapers were told just what they should do. They were told that they should have respect for authority. Yes, dear Isabel, that means authority having the sanction, approval, and nod of approbation of the Legion. The newspapers need not be concerned with the authority of Almighty God or His laws. The constitutional injunction to worship Almighty God should not be respected either, for the reason that this subversive, un-American and un-Christian organization has shown that it has no respect for Jehovah God or for the Maryland constitution.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>Aid and Comfort to Fanatics</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The newspapers were informed that they should refrain from giving aid and comfort to fanatics. That isn’t such a bad idea. These overheated fanatics who say “Salute or be damned” should not receive any aid or comfort from the newspapers. It is encouraging that the majority of the reputable newspapers of the country are following that policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The newspapers should present issues without bias and enlighten the ignorant. Yes, you have it right, Annabelle. That means they should print only the Legion's side of the story. That's the only way to keep “liberty and democracy” in good trim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The newspapers ’should endeavor to inculcate a sense of patriotism. And that, worthy reader, has merit. True patriotism, which recognizes the nation just as far as Christ recognized Caesar, and no more, and which recognizes Almighty God as the supreme power, should be encouraged by all newspapers. But the Legion does not know what constitutes patriotism, and is in no position to advise others about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The said resolution proceeds further with injunctions and advice to the father of the Ludke children. He is advised to learn the definition of the words “flag&quot; and “salute”, and to instruct his children concerning them. It gratuitously furnishes a definition of salute, made by them for special occasion, which states that the salute is just a sign of respect to the flag, the same as tipping the hat to a lady.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Apply the same terms and conditions to tipping the hat to a lady as are applied to the flag salute, and what have you?</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>The Legion’s New Goddess</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">You have the following: The lady is sacred. She is pure, innocent, truthful, sincere, just, brave. (Some lady. Queen Elizabeth and Bloody Mary should be living now.) She must be treated with respect; with reverence; and all must be devoted to her. She will protect and give salvation to all. Laws must be passed requiring all men to salute a lady at sight. Anyone failing to salute will be refused the privilege of walking on the street, or of receiving any benefits from the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thus the lady becomes a goddess and the tipping of the hat becomes an act of obeisance to a sacred object, which is nothing more nor less than an act of worship. The flag-salute matter of Oxon Hill is not yet over. The children are still being denied the privilege of attendance at the public school, but another organization has now entered the arena. The American Civil Liberties Union, an organization which has some real love for the principles of liberty, democracy, freedom of worship and freedom of conscience, has volunteered its services, furnished counsel, and will assist the parents in presenting the matter to the courts so that the school board can be educated as to its duty and privilege in the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the meantime the busy and ubiquitous members of the Legion and the so nice and submissive members of the school board can reflect on what they have accomplished; for it is admitted they have accomplished something.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They have denied educational advantages to six children in whom they can find no occasion or fault except concerning the law of their God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They have insulted and dishonored the flag by denying the liberty of which that emblem is supposed to be a symbol.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They have put Prince Georges county on the map as a place where religious freedom is barred and where the flag-saluting cult is boss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They have tried to stifle conscience and to make hypocrites out of innocent children; but, thank God, in that they did not succeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Petition Puts Roman Catholic Hierarchy on the Run</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HE national petition circulated by Jehovah's witnesses has the Roman Catholic Hierarchy on the run, and as the hunting season begins they are hunting their holes. The Hierarchy views with deadly terror any public debate with Judge Rutherford. As in their hearts they know they have no answer to make to the charges they are certain he will bring, they are doing all possible to prevent circulation of the petition. They figure that the best answer is no answer. They do not dare and do not wish to fight in the open like men. In a real fight they show only their rear quarters. In the picture Samson smote the Philistines “hip and thigh”. These were the only places he could reach. Hence this kick, in the same place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One of the Kingdom publishers drifted into the office of the Denver </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Register</span><span class="font8"> and cheerfully asked everybody who loves fair play to sign the petition, so that matters can be discussed in the open—American style. There is no reason, if he is honest, why any priest or prelate should refuse to sign a petition which starts off thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Roman Catholic Press protests the broadcasting of Judge Rutherford’s speeches by radio for the reason, as claimed, that he misrepresents the teachings of the Catholic Church concerning the salvation of the human race Millions of persons claim that he does not misrepresent such teachings, and many others are confused as to what is the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The people in the office of the Denver </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Register</span><span class="font8"> showed their Catholic training. They took the petition inside where the more-or-less men copied it for their paper, and then their spokesman came out and said, in effect, that they did not dare sign it because “Father” somebody or other was away on his vacation. So the Kingdom publisher, a lady, took her leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As soon as the lady left the office the Denver </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Register</span><span class="font8"> wrote a big scarehead two columns wide:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“rutherford is seeking to </span><span class="font5">REGAIN AIR THROUGH DEBATE”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of course, as every reader of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font8">well knows, Judge Rutherford was never off the air. The Roman Hierarchy in its big press campaign from the Atlantic to the Pacific to force him from the air actually bluffed and bulldozed and bullyragged less than 30 stations out of more than 300 into discontinuing the broadcasts of his Bible talks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Denver </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Register</span><span class="font8"> staff that did not dare sign a petition being circulated by a lady until after they had received permission from some person dressed in skirts, sex not known, but guessed, then went on to say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under the subtle guise of a radio debate to explain his beliefs, “Judge” Joseph F. Rutherford, who has been ruled off the air in many cities for his bitter attacks on religion, is attempting to regain his broadcasting status. Petitions are being circulated all over Denver, probably in other sections of the country, asking that a debate between Rutherford and some Church official be arranged through the Federal Communications Commission. Rutherford’s teachings have been inimical to the Church and religion. The proposed debate is a mere advertising stunt, and no priest would take part in it. Catholics and any others interested in the promotion of religion and opposed to bigotry will be careful </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">not</span><span class="font7"> to sign this petition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For the information of those who may be approached by “Jehovah’s witnesses” for their signature a copy of the petition, preceded by a copy of the framed, printed appeal that accompanies it, is printed below:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every fair-minded person is deeply interested in the life and happiness of the people. Would you like to hear open, frank discussion of this subject by a high Catholic official and a well-known judge, over a nation wide chain of radio stations? If so, please read and sign this petition.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Early in May we had some correspondence In reference to Joseph Rutherford who broadcasts over WMCA. The scurrilous nature of some of his addresses was called to your attention an-i you agreed to&quot; censor his speeches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Ter the past few weeks he has been ir.offena-ive but last Sunday he again went forth on an anti-Cntholic tirade. He Misrepresented Catholic doctrine and made a bigoted attack on the late Cardinal Gibbons end his belief.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">varicating freely, wholly and unreservedly, that paragraph contains five distinct, willful and intentional falsehoods. It is designed to mislead Catholics and to keep them in ignorance of the challenge to debate contained in the petition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Those holy chanticleers with long skirts, scapulars and fish hats like to use Latin texts. Here is one for all of them to use from now on and forever: “Ante tubam trepidat” (“Before the trumpet sounds he trembles”). They have become panicky, terror-stricken, scared and frightened before the challenge gets to them. The courage of their mighty men is all oozed out and —with apologies to the ladies—they have indeed</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font7">leans not to sign any petition presented to them without reading it over carefully to ascertain its purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are not at all interested in the programs of Rutherford if they are intended to express his beliefs or his principles. He is entitled to legitimate freedom of speech, just as any other citizen, and far be it from us to seek interference with this right of any citizen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But if such programs are intended to revile the hierarchy of the Catholic Church and cast aspersions and slurs upon our beliefs and our Church as was done in previous programs, we do protest and object to such programs in as much as they are a prostitution and abuse of free speech and an offense against a large body of law-abiding citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Two weeks later the “Right Reverend” Peter</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">M. H. Wynhoven (be sure to stick in the words “Right” and “Reverend”) had the following, again in bold display, on the front page of his paper:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Caution! Attention is again directed to the circulation of a petition in New Orleans, which we understand is being signed by some persons without knowing what it is all about. The petition begins with a statement to the effect that the Roman Catholic Church is opposed to the Rutherford radio programs. Some, concluding from this opening statement that it is a protest against the Watchtower programs, have signed it. We know of one case where a Catholic parishioner ascertained that some eight Catholics had signed it, caught up with the woman circulating the petition and, after reading it over, scratched out the names of these Catholics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The petition turned out to be a demand for a debate between Catholics and others connected with the program. Catholics are warned that Church authorities have nothing whatever to do with such a move and they positively should not sign such a petition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In as much as it appears that such </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> petition with signatures will be used, we suggest that Catholic organizations of New Orleans adopt resolutions and go on record as opposed to any such proposal and to the presentation of any program intended to abuse or vilify the Catholic church and her ministers or east ridicule upon the beliefs of Catholics. We caution Catholics once more not to sign any petition without reading it over completely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Take a squint at these two advertisements and see what they reveal:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">a. Catholic people are not supposed to use their own judgment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">b. The “Right Reverends” assume that even when Catholics have had the petition right in front of them when they signed, they yet did not know what they were signing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">c. That, in one sentence, “Right Reverends” believe in “legitimate” freedom of speech and, in the next, take care to explain that they believe in nothing of the kind; which latter statement is the exact truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">d. That having been cautioned once against using their own brains, it is found necessary to repeat the warning.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">e. That it is right for one person to destroy the property of another.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">f. That it is right for one Catholic to act in such a manner as to destroy acts of good will by other Catholics.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">g. Catholics are again warned not to sign. Why all the heat and all the anxiety?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">h. Catholic organizations are urged to take up the fight to see that there be no open, honest public discussion of Catholic doctrines.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">i. It is taken for granted that any public discussion of her teachings would make the Catholic sect appear ridiculous. And that is true.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Still perturbed as late as September 17, Wynhoven’s paper, in black type on the front page, again said frantically:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Doorbells! Complaints have again been received about representatives of an organization ringing doorbells and requesting persons to sign a petition in regard to a radio program. Catholics are warned not to sign any petitions whatsoever without reading them over carefully to ascertain just what they contain and what they are intended for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The way the matter broke in on the readers of the Pittsburgh </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic</span><span class="font8"> was as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Rutherfordites’ Latest. The latest activity of the members of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, followers of Judge Rutherford, whose radio attacks on all organized religion are carried by stations in various parts of the country, is the circulation of petitions which appear to be requests for the banning of the judge from the air, but which turn out to be a demand for a debate between him and someone representing the Catholic church. Reports from cities as widely separated as New Orleans, Detroit and Los Angeles state that Catholics have been prevailed upon to sign such petitions under the impression that they were asking for the elimination of the Rutherford programs. Needless to say, Catholics should have nothing to do with papers offered for signature by this group. It is suggested that readers of this notice warn their neighbors to beware of any petition presented to them, the object of which is not clearly worthy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah's people can only smile at the terror caused by their honesty and faithfulness toward Jehovah God—and keep right on doing His will until the great vindication takes place.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>Many Other Catholic Press Objectors</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Not only have the “religious” Catholic papers objected, but here is a two-column scare story in the Waterbury </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Democrat</span><span class="font8"> aimed to accomplish the same end. The paper is owned by Mr. Maloney. Guess his “church”. The headlines read:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">CHAMBER OF COMMERCE RECEIVES COMPLAINTS OF ALLEGED MISREPRESENTATION CATHOLICS ASSAILED”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One comical thing happened in the Redwood City (California) area. Some bright priest got the idea to shut off Jehovah's witnesses by circulating a petition, similar in typography to the one used by Jehovah’s witnesses, but headed with the caption “Get Judge Rutherford Off the Air”. Workers were sent out with little green testimony cards similiar to those used by Jehovah’s witnesses. The scheme blew up, because when the Catholic workers went to the homes of the people they found, to their dismay, that the people themselves wish to hear what the priests do not want them to hear. By this blunder the petition work was really helped in Redwood City.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Not being entirely satisfied with either the methods or the objectives of the Roman Catholic cult, two of the Kingdom publishers of Minneapolis called upon John Dunphy, priest, one of the dignitaries of the sect most interested in having WDGY blown up. Some will be interested in their report of their visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After about five minutes Dunphy appeared and I introduced myself by name and then Mr. Morrison by name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I then handed Dunphy the petition testimony card, stating that I would like to have him read it. Dunphy took plenty of time to read the card and then exclaimed loudly, “Why all this secrecy? Why not come out with the name—who the judge is?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I stated that the judge’s name was on the petition, and handed Dunphy the petition, which he read carefully and slowly. I then asked him if he wouldn’t like to sign the petition. Excitedly Priest Dunphy roared, “I’ll have nothing to do with it! Judge Rutherford attacks our church. If he will let us alone, we’ll let him alone! ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Morrison: “Do you believe in free speech?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dunphy: “Yes, I do, but Judge Rutherford shouldn’t attack the Catholic church.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Morrison: “The judge never attacks any person, but does attack the teachings of the Hierarchy by quoting from the Bible. Whenever anyone sets forth teachings concerning the Bible it becomes public property and anyone is at liberty to discuss it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“ No! ” roared Dunphy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“But,” remonstrated Morrison, “if a politician makes a speech, doesn’t it become a subject of general discussion?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Yes,” assented Dunphy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">* ‘ Don’t you think, ’’inquired Mr. Kjorlien, “that it would be a good thing to have a fair, open and honest discussion over the radio, so that all the people could hear it? Let some high Catholic ofncial take one side and give Judge Rutherford a chance to answer?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“ No! ” roared Dunphy, “it would cause too much controversy!’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Kjorlien: “We formerly broadcast Judge Rutherford’s lectures over WRHM and the Catholic Hierarchy protested to the manager and tried to get the programs off the air at that time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dunphy: “We have a right to fight back! That’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">what I’ve got against Coughlin; he attacked President Roosevelt and called him a liar. We’ve got to be loyal to the constitution. I never heard Judge Rutherford.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Morrison: “What constitution?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dunphy: “The United States constitution.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Morrison: “This petition wouldn’t have been brought to the people here if it hadn’t been for the action of the Hierarchy at Philadelphia in connection with WIP.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dunphy; “That’s their fight. We have nothing to do with that.” Then motioning us to the door, “I won’t have anything to do with the petition. You go to St. Paul, to the Chancery on Dayton avenue, and see Archbishop Murray. They are over us and they will give you a statement. I don’t want to talk about it, it makes me too excited. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Northern Rhodesia Moffats Well Scrambled</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font8">T IS always a pleasure to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> to tell the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Northern Rhodesia, at Mufulira, a certain Schaefer boxed the ears of Negro workers in the copper mines so severely that he burst the eardrums of several, and fifty required hospital attention because of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The district officer, representative of the Northern Rhodesian government, residing at Mufulira, and responsible for the well-being of one of the most childlike and lovable groups of natives in the world, was and is John S. Moffat, son of “Rev.” Malcolm Moffat, “missionary,” and descendant of the Moffat family with which David Livingstone, the discoverer of Northern Rhodesia, was connected by marriage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The foregoing are the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The original story appearing in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> No. 425, page 206, first paragraph, correctly cited Schaefer as the compound manager who did the boxing. No information at that time available in the United States could prevent the misconception and therefore the misstatement that the Rev. Malcolm S. Moffat was the one responsible for the conduct of Schaefer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In due time, in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> No. 432, page 439, last paragraph, an attempt was made to correct the “Moffat” error, with results not one hundred percent perfect, as the following gracious and kindly letter from the South African branch of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society makes clear:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Having given us the reputation of “striving for absolute accuracy” (as per current issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> No. 432, page 439, last paragraph) we feel that we must live up to it and therefore have to call your attention to the fact that in sorting out the Moffats you have inadvertently stated that Moffat junior was the man who boxed the cars of the natives. While as district officer he was to a certain extent responsible for conditions obtaining at Mufulira, it was, nevertheless, Ben Schaefer, the compound manager, who did the actual boxing. See paragraph 31 of the Commission’s Report and your own article in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age </span><span class="font7">No. 425, page 206, paragraph 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You will be pleased to learn that your slashing attack on the Moffats has opened the eyes of a number of the Europeans in the Rhodesias to the true situation. You will be interested in some of the enclosed clips, one of which has a good whack at the Moffats. The closing paragraph in “Unity’s” letter in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Northern Rhodesian Advertiser,</span><span class="font7"> issue of May 9, is also good!</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Fascism in Trinidad, British West Indies</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font8">E THOUGHT that freedom of conscience and freedom of speech were two of the main pillars of the British system of government. The Executive Council of Trinidad last week taught us that either we had been mistaken all along or that an experiment in the Fascist system of government is to be tried out in Trinidad. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Trinidad Royal Gazette</span><span class="font8"> of August 20 contains a proclamation by His Excellency the Acting Governor in Executive Council prohibiting “absolutely the importation into this colony of any past or future issue of the publication entitled </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> and of any other publication or literature published or issued by or under the auspices of the aforesaid Golden Age Publishing Company, Inc., or the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, or of any of their agencies in other countries”. Were it not for the serious consequences to the parties immediately concerned, this proclamation would deserve to be framed and exhibited as an object for ridicule and contempt. . . . The Watch Tower Society has nobody’s word but His Excellency’s for their preaching sedition, the Acting Governor apparently knowing the tenets of their faith better than themselves!!! . . . </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The People</span><span class="font8"> is humiliated to think that such a proclamation could be issued in a British colony, and, worst of all, in Trinidad, where one likes to feel that progress and not reaction is the guiding principle of administrators. . . . Within recent months </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> has been publishing some very caustic attacks on its religious opponents and also on the League of Nations. ... If Judge Rutherford holds that the League of Nations is an “organized hypocrisy” he is entitled to say so; even though His Excellency does not share his opinion, which should not surprise the Judge. ... If he cares to preach that the existing governments of the world will soon perish, he is entitled to do so; so long as he does not call upon anyone to rise in revolt against them.—■ </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The People,</span><span class="font8"> Port of Spain, Trinidad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Rome-Controlled Press and the Honest Press</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font8">N Pope Pius’ address at Castel Gandolfo, September 14, 1936, he said, “The Catholic press is persistently suspected.” That much of his address was the truth. The Hearst press is persistently suspected, too, and all the rest of the Fascist press. Even the children in the streets know that not a word they say is to be believed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The children do not yet know, but they will know soon, that the pope, Mussolini and Hitler are in a conspiracy to overrun the world, and that, after Ethiopia, the Spanish Republic was and is the next victim. There is no crime this gang of freebooters would not commit. They are aided and abetted in the crime by the Rome-controlled press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Here is a sample of the propaganda of the Roman press itself. It is from the Baltimore </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Rcvieiv.</span><span class="font8"> It is a statement wholly false, but serves as a guide to the Rome-controlled publishers that do not dare to stand on their own feet like men, but shiver in fear of the boycott. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> cartoonist, as his pictures in this issue show, has not a grain of respect for publishers who are merely printers of what Rome lets them print—meanwhile letting the seekers for truth and honesty </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">starve.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">ANSWERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">1. The Loyalists or Leftists constitute the present party or “government” which is trying to rule Spain. The Rightists are the loyal Catholics who are trying to gain Religious Freedom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">2. The Loyalists are being supported by Soviet Russia. The Communists who are supporting the Loyalists, are killing priests, nuns, members of religious brotherhoods—men, women and children; burning churches, schools, convents and monasteries, exiling bishops, priests, members of Religious sisterhoods and brotherhoods.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">3. The mediate cause of the rebellion was the campaign of Murder, Fire and Robbery for which the Loyalists or Leftists are responsible. The Leftists are the enemies of Freedom of Religion, Freedom of Speech, Freedom of the Press. The immediate cause of the rebellion was the kidnaping and murder of Calvo Sotelo, one of the dauntless leaders of the Rightists. His assassination was the spark that lighted the fire of rebellion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">4. They are fighting for Religious Freedom, Human Rights, Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Press, for the very salvation of their country which they are trying to rescue from the bloody grasp of the Soviet-backed Communists, who are now in control of the government in Spain.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">5. The Rightists.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">But there are some honest and capable publishers, and in this issue there is plenty of material from their columns to make the Rome-controlled ones hang their heads in shame till the end of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Having planned the murder of millions of honest Catholics, it is well that the pope should say of these objects of his wrath, miscalled “Reds”, what he said of them in his speech at Castel Gandolfo:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“So that we cannot, and could not for one moment, doubt as to what is left for us to do, to love them, and love them with a special love born of mercy and compassion; to love them, and, since we can do nothing else, to pray for them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(It would have been an act of kindness for him to leave out his prayers. Countless examples in history show that the worst thing that can happen to anybody is to have the pope pray for him.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The minute a newspaper refuses or neglects to play the part of a lickspittle to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, it can expect to receive some little loving attention like the one quoted below<sup>7</sup>, which appeared in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Register</span><span class="font8"> (Roman Catholic) and speaks for itself on the abject manner in which the newspapers of Philadelphia grovel before the Hierarchy at a word of command, and even when they were dead right in their original position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Philadelphia </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Record</span><span class="font7"> ran an editorial denouncing the Spanish revolt against the Madrid government. Somehow, its staff was unaware of the indignities that Catholics had been suffering at the hands of the Leftist regime—quite a reflection, we take it, on the news services supplying the paper and also on the amount of reading done by the staff. The next day, realizing the mistake made, the paper printed another editorial, which it was hoped would offset Catholic criticism. But </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Standard and Times</span><span class="font7"> quite correctly denounced the first editorial. J. David Stern then wrote a letter of apology to Cardinal Dougherty, and professed the stand of the paper for religious freedom and tolerance. His Eminence, in a gracious reply, expressed his gratification. We congratulate the Catholics of Philadelphia on the watchfulness of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Standard and Times.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">May 28. “Don Manuel Azana, the new president of Spain, has a special claim on lovers of English literature. He is the translator into Spanish of Borrow's Bible in Spain.

<p><span class="font8">July 25. “The military uprising in Spain is the final outburst of latent Fascist, clerical and aristocratic forces which for many months have sought to undermine the Left Republican government at Madrid. Ever since the Popular Front, comprised of Syndicalists, Communists, Socialists, and Republican parties, won its victory in the elections of February 16, there have been rumors that the army would use force to annul the decision of the people. Grandees who were being deprived of their landed estates, capitalists who feared revolutionary measures in favor of workers’ organizations, and the Jesuits who had experienced an economic renaissance under a former premier, Lerroux, were all at hand with ample funds to finance the movement.” “. . . The Foreign press was feeding on stories of Spanish atrocities and the burning of a few churches was exaggerated a hundredfold.” —New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Aug. 14. “The Fascist generals are of the true brand.

<p><span class="font8">Aug. 28. “The Spanish government may be an incompetent government, a foolish government, a thoroughly bad government; but it is the government of the Spanish people chosen by their ballots. It is a government supported by a majority of the elected representatives of the people. Therefore, the desperate resistance to its overthrow by a military clique shows that the Spaniards are ready to fight for what they believe is liberty, whether or not it really deserves that name. Who is omniscient ? Who can do more than fight for the faith that is in him ?”—Gerald W. Johnson (ablest editor in American journalism) in Baltimore </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sept. 1. “The rebellion did not originate in Spain. It is not the work of Spaniards. It is not a war on Communism. It is a Fascist war on democracy. It was plotted in Vatican City and Rome and Berlin, and not in Moscow. The government of Spain is not Red. It is democratic. It was overwhelmingly elected by the Spanish people. It functions under one of the most liberal and enlightened constitutions yet brought into the world. . . . Mussolini boldly announces his support of the rebels. Hitler promises recognition and active support if the insurgents can take Madrid. So does the Spanish Republic face the Fascist war lords. Its back is to the wall. In high official utterances the ablest of modern popes condemns the sovereignty of the people as a vicious and dangerous fallacy.”—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Fellowship Forum.</span></p>

From this basic problem stem others of the same overwhelming character: a low health level, lack of sanitation facilities, a high infant mortality, a high incidence of petty crime, a high percentage of illiteracy, faulty transportation and communication, primitive public conveniences, institutions and necessities, an incubus of usury, all-pervading bureaucratic corruption and graft and, in the aristocratic classes, a habit of social irresponsibility and an impulse to settle all restlessness by repression and violence.”—New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times.</span></p>

Fifteen, twenty times the crest of the ridges changed hands in one day. Women of the People’s Front who had thrown away their skirts made a bayonet charge at nine this morning. They overwhelmed the rebel artillery, killing all the gunners, but were themselves massacred two hours later by the troops of General Mola. We are now on the crest and can see the havoc wrought. I cannot describe the bestiality the Fascists perpetrated upon the girls who defended the legitimate government of the country. Many are lying here fastened to the ground by bayonets stuck through their abdomens. . . . On the Col de Leon the Fascists advanced driving the peasant women and children before them. A measureless indignation swept through the ranks of the People’s Militia at the sight of this pathetic human screen. But there was no alternative. Either shoot down the wives and children of their own partisans, or give up the battle and deliver the revolutionary capital into the hands of the Fascists. We have just heard the unbelievably terrible outcome of that cowardly Fascist trick. When the women came within hailing distance of the People's Militia, some of them called out, ‘Compaiieros, don’t hesitate ! Shoot us down!

<p><span class="font8">Aug. 26. “Fourteen days on this front, going from village to village, revealed that almost every church and convent in the district had been a depot for Fascist arms, stocked up before the outbreak of the rebellion.’-Toronto </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Star.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">July 30. “The Catholic church has been said to have owned one-third of Spanish wealth.”— Spokane </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Chronicle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Aug. 1. “Where does the money for the Spanish Fascists come from? Foremost among the contributors one must place the Jesuits whose banks line the main business street of Madrid. The Vatican has announced in its official organ, the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Osservatore Romano,</span><span class="font8"> that it is neutral in the struggle. But reports about the activities of priests in Navarre, the most important Fascist stronghold, are beginning to trickle through.”—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">August 3. “Convents, seized for the most part by the militia in various parts of Spain, yielded 22,700,000 pesetas. (Approximately $2,950,000 on the basis of exchange rates quoted before the outbreak of the civil war. When last quoted the peseta was worth about 13c.) The seized funds were delivered to the authorities. At Gerona the bishop’s palace yielded government bonds worth 20,000,000 pesetas. The ministry of the interior broadcast that the militia at Jaen arrested the bishop of the diocese while he was fleeing in the company of his sisters and other relatives. The bishop was found in possession of 1,000,000 pesetas. Government bonds worth 8,000,000 pesetas were found secreted in his sister’s corset. The bishop and his relatives were jailed and his cathedral was converted into a prison.” —Indianapolis </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Star.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Aug. 19. “A large sum of money and securities have been found in safes hired at the Credit Lyonnais Bank in Madrid by the Community of Saint Vincent de Paul, commonly known as “Little Sisters of the Poor”. Among the valuables were £33,500 worth of pesetas in banknotes, £1,500,000 in gilt-edged securities, an enormous amount of bullion, and property titles to 93 houses and estates in and around Madrid worth over £2,500,000. There were also gelid coins of great antiquity worth a considerable sum. Hidden in safes under the money and securities were also rough cloth belts and aprons cleverly devised for the hiding of banknotes and valuables. Similar hoardings are being found daily in convents and palaces abandoned by religious orders.”—London </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">News Chronicle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sept. 5. “Treasure of Barcelona Cathedral estimated to be worth more than $5,000,000 has been seized by Loyalist militiamen. It had been hidden in a secret steel chamber close to the vestry. The door to this chamber formed part of one of the walls.”—New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Aug. 7. “The inquiry conducted by the French authorities shows that the machines which landed in French Morocco and the three others which accompanied them in the flight to Spanish Morocco were all regular Italian Air Force planes.”—Manchester </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Aug. 11. “Finally one of the huge steel bombers (one of the five Capronis bombing the Popular Front) came too close to the earth and was brought down. It burst into flames. I went to see the twisted mass of metal and the black-burned bodies of the six occupants later in the day and took note that the three machine guns on board were of Italian manufacture. The motors were Alta-Romea 650 h.p., well-known Italian mark. . . . Before the west wall of the church 1 saw the most horrible spectacle I ever beheld in my life. The bloody ferocity of Ethiopia was surpassed. In a long row, in grotesque attitudes of death lay seventy or eighty children. They had been executed. All of them wore the blue shirts of the socialist sport club. The Fascists, when they were at Buitroga a week ago, had put these children against the wall and killed them. I walked along the row of horribly tortured bodies. I could not help weeping at the sight of such a holocaust. My hands still tremble as I write these lines. On many of the dead faces of these children lay an expression of surprised pain and innocence.&quot;—Pierre Van Paassen in Toronto </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Star.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Aug. 14. “Mr. Kluckhohn went out to the aviation field (at Seville, rebel headquarters) and saw and counted the planes of both German and Italian make. He also had the opportunity of interviewing aviation officials and General Franco himself, who plainly intimated the intention of using these planes in bombing Madrid, if such a step became necessary in order to drive out the Government. German and Italian pilots were still in charge of these war machines, and were instructing Spanish fliers in the use of them.”—New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sept. 4. “Among the documents found on the body of the Italian aviator who burned to death in the fight with our pursuit planes over government lines was found an order signed by General Kindelan, in which he was ordered to fly over towns in Estremadura and drop as many bombs as possible. It is accepted in war to bomb communications and military buildings and other enemy positions. But what caused great indignation is the discovery that the order had been given to a foreigner to destroy open cities and defenseless populations with no other motive than to hurt them and to destroy priceless monuments.”—Madrid government War Ministry statement, New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sept. 14. “Sailors on the battleship Jaime I and the troops that took part in the abortive Catalan invasion of Majorca declare unhesitatingly that two Rebel planes of Italian make were used to drop bombs and then would go off across the sea in a northeasterly direction, returning in three or four hours with another load of bombs. An eyewitness deduced that the planes reloaded bombs in Italian territory, but they might have obtained them from a ship at sea.”— NewYork </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font8"> dispatch from Walter Duranty.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Aug. 7. “Messages from the Mediterranean continue to report the activities of the German warships which are visiting the Spanish ports held by the rebels. It is now known that in addition to the visits to General Franco at Ceuta and the rebel leaders at Algeciras and Melilla, the German destroyer Leopard paid a visit to Seville, where (according to Reuter's Gibraltar correspondent) its commander complimented General Llano, one of the chief rebel leaders. A French report says that German bluejackets landed and marched to the city hall singing German songs and shouting ‘Heil Hitler’.”—Manchester </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Aug. 28. ‘‘The parts were taken to Seville in two freight trains composed of fifty-nine cars, all accompanied by fifty armed Germans. These Germans assembled the planes and tanks at Tablade Airdrome in Seville and handed them to the Rebels, then joined Franco’s Foreign Legion. I also know the Rebels received much more war material from Germany than they were able to pay for in cash down.”—New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sept. 14. “Madrid’s Civil Guards and militia fought the flower of the insurgent army to a standstill outside Talavera until the German planes got into action two days ago. For this writer has been able to solve the mystery of Caceres, General Franco’s headquarters, a mystery that has sent every American and French correspondent who has learned the answer to jail here or led to their being held and permitted to send only censored dispatches. The secret is that Caceres has been made into a gigantic air base filled with German aviators who go out mornings to bomb Madrid and its Loyalist defenders and who drive the Loyalist planes that have hampered the insurgent advances from the skies. This is an amazing international situation, for foreign airmen are literally winning the uprising for one side in the Spanish revolution. . . . So carefully guarded is Caceres that the German aviators no longer make the pretense of wearing Spanish uniforms and they clamber into their planes and take off openly, as this writer is able to testify.”—New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>Moors on the Side of the Pope</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Aug. 12. “If one considers the unscrupulousness of this military rising against a government that had not even a Socialist member in it, their fiendish plan of conquering Spain with the Foreign Legion and Moors and the appalling ruin it is bringing on the country, one cannot altogether blame the working classes if they burn the houses belonging to their enemies or even shoot a few of them in cold blood.”—George Beaton, Spain, in London </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Neivs Chronicle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sept. 12. “The Rebels occupied Talavera without resistance, although the town was not ill prepared for defense, and swept on across an undemolished bridge over the River Tagus along the road to Madrid to a point thirteen miles beyond Talavera, where they halted breathless. Meanwhile the Moors, with curved knives, massacred, raped and looted in Talavera —I talked with refugees and what they said was dreadful—to their heart’s content.”—Walter Duranty in New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times.</span><span class="font8"> (Duranty’s dispatches can always be depended upon as truthful. This dispatch shows that in the pope’s “Holy War” to conquer the Spanish Republic the pope is using Moors to destroy civilization in Spain. The pope’s crocodile tears give honest people a pain in the neck. As an inciter of murder he should be given the rating of Aa Al. So fearful were the rulers of Spain of the prowess of Moorish fighters that Queen Isabella, four hundred years ago, left as her dying request an urgent message to all who might follow her, that they should never cease to undertake the complete subjugation of the Moors, as otherwise Spain would never be safe from recapture by them. The pope forgets all this.)</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark73"></a>Dishonest Press on Side of Pope</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Aug. 27. “Like Bernard Sullivan, I am a member of the Roman Catholic Church, and, having recently returned from Spain, I am amazed at the ignorance which appears to exist among Catholics regarding the situation, and the responsibility of those who have plunged the country into the horrors of civil war. The Catholic papers vie with one another to produce the most sensational and horrible atrocity stories, oblivious of the fact that such stories are constantly being denied by the International Journalists on the spot. It is as deliberate a lie to speak of the democratic government of Spain as ‘Red’ as it is a lie to pretend the Fascist rebels, as loyal sons of the Church, are fighting to preserve religious freedom.”—Miss Monica Whately, Roman Catholic, Labor candidate for Parliament, in the British </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Labor and Industrial Neus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sept. 5. “Both Hearst and the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span><span class="font8"> have featured reports from special correspondents who have been only in rebel territory. As a result these papers have created the impression (1) that the rebels are fighting for civilization against a Communist government in Madrid, (2) that the ‘reds’ have been guilty of appalling atrocities, and (3) that Madrid was about to fall on any number of occasions. But, irrespective of these deliberate falsifications, it is extremely difficult for the average man to follow the fortunes of the contestants.”—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Respect to the Flag</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">O</span><span class="font8">NE Cardinal Hayes, addressing the “Holy Name” convention in St. Patrick’s cathedral, New York, said, among other things, “We may have to battle here in America for the flag that flies over our heads. When I was a boy, we were taught to have reverence to the flag. Now it is a struggle among children to get them to respect the flag. America will never find the Catholic church an enemy, never find the Catholic church undermining, destroying the government.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">America, then, has the cardinal’s word for it that the Catholic “church” will never do in this country what it is trying to do in Spain and Mexico, and what it has in the past plotted to do, and will doubtless in the near future plot to do in England, if it is not doing so now, by Fascistic moves through Catholic agents seeking to grasp power there by every underhanded means it can employ. But, is the cardinal’s word reliable?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is doubtless as reliable as his utterance regarding the children who will not do [Catholic formalistic] reverence to the flag. Saluting a flag, an image or symbol, is of a piece with bowing to or kissing or otherwise kowtowing to a cross. (Exodus 20:1-5) One may very easily, if one has that kind of principles, bow to, and at the same time the “heart be far from”, that which the outward expression appears to “respect&quot;. (Isaiah 29:13) Respect is not of such make-up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The cardinal should know, and doubtless does know, that there is an insignificant number of children who refrain from saluting the flag, any flag, and that these do so because of their training to maintain their integrity. They are the children of Jehovah’s witnesses, from whom no trouble of any kind need be anticipated. There is here no need of “battle” of the kind the cardinal contemplates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It may be some consolation to the troubled cardinal that neither will these children salute any other flag that may at some future time seek to replace the stars and stripes, something analogous, perhaps, to the crooked cross on the swastika emblem. Flag worship, as far as Jehovah’s witnesses are concerned, is a thing of the past; both outwardly and inwardly they will worship Jehovah alone. And many others are beginning to refuse their countries first place, reserving that place to God alone, though such may not yet clearly see the propriety of refraining from offering obeisance to a country’s symbol.</span></p>
