<li>

The defendant Archdiocese of Philadelphia is an ecclesiastical corporation or juridical personality created or recognized by the laws of Pennsylvania, controlled and directed by the defendant Archbishop Dougherty and subject to his sole authority and jurisdiction.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">VIII. That among the duties within the scope of office and employment of the several above-named defendants are those of promoting the ecclesiastical and material interests of the said Roman Catholic Church and its beliefs and dogmas, and to discourage and thwart so far as possible all opposed teachings and activities.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">IX. Plaintiff as President and public spokesman of the said Watch Tower Society, has for the past ten years and more regularly conducted through the facilities of the Pennsylvania Broadcasting Company, a radio broadcasting station known as WIP, located in Philadelphia, a weekly broadcast on Bible subjects, for fifteen minutes each Sunday, and over a national or international circuit, under a contract in writing between said Watch Tower Company and said Pennsylvania Broadcasting Co., and was so engaged at the times hereinafter mentioned, up to its interruption by the above-named defendants.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">X. Plaintiff is a good, true, honest and faithful citizen, and as such hath always behaved and conducted himself, and until the committing of the several grievances by the said several defendants, as hereinafter mentioned, was always reputed, esteemed and accepted by and amongst his friends, neighbors, acquaintances and great audiences of good persons throughout the States of New York, Pennsylvania and the United States to whom he was in any wise known, to be a person of good name, fame and credit, and especially for honesty and truthfulness, and the desire to promote peace and good will amongst men.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">XL And whereas, also, the said plaintiff, Joseph F. Rutherford, hath not ever been guilty, nor until the time of the committing of the several grievances by the said defendants as hereinafter mentioned, been suspected or supposed to have been guilty of dishonesty, untruthfulness or the stirring up of strife or ill will or any other crime or dishonesty.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">XII. By reason of which said premises, he, the said plaintiff, before the committing of the said several grievances by the said defendants as hereinafter mentioned, had deservedly the good opinion and credit of all his neighbors and other good and worthy citizens and persons throughout the said States and elsewhere to whom he was in any wise known personally or through his public speaking, books and writings, to wit, largely throughout the United States and abroad.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">XIII. Yet the said several defendants above named, well knowing the premises, but greatly envying the happy state and condition of the said plaintiff and fearing and hating the effects of his widespread teachings of Biblical truths, and contriving together and wickedly and maliciously intending to injure the said plaintiff Joseph F. Rutherford in his said good name, fame and credit, and to bring him into public scandal, infamy and disgrace, with and amongst all neighbors and other good and worthy people, and to cause it to be suspected and believed by those neighbors and persons that he, the said Joseph F. Rutherford, had been and was guilty of dishonesty, untruthfulness, misrepresentations and the fomenting of religious hatred and bigotry, and to expose him to whatever pains and penalties provided by law or public opinion against persons so guilty; and to vex, harass, oppress, impoverish and wholly ruin him, the said Joseph F. Rutherford in his person and profession and activities, heretofore, to wit, on or about the 15th day of February, 1936, at Philadelphia, in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, did maliciously concert and conspire together to, and did falsely and maliciously compose and publish, and cause and procure to be published of and concerning him, the said Joseph F. Rutherford, plaintiff herein, a certain false, scandalous, malicious and defamatory libel, in the words, manner and setting forth as follow’s:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">XIV. The defendant James J. Clarke falsely and maliciously wrote, at the instigation of the other three named defendants who concurred in and in writing endorsed said letter, as follows, to wit:</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">XV. The aforesaid letter was duly mailed or forwarded to and received by said Station WIP and by Gimbel Bros., who own or control the said broadcasting station and are heavily interested in it financially, and who also own and operate one of the most extensive department stores in the said City, of which the said defendant Clarke was, as alleged in said letter, a customer with a credit account, and also as alleged a very large percentage of its customers were Roman Catholic parishioners and adherents and also auditors of the radio broadcast addresses of this plaintiff, as in said letter indicated.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">XVI. By the words of the said letter, several times repeated, naming Judge Rutherford, the said defendants meant and intended this plaintiff, Joseph F. Rutherford, who is a lawyer and a practicing attorney of the New York Bar, and was formerly a Judge of Court, and who is known and called “Judge Rutherford” by all who in any wise know or know of him, throughout the country and elsewhere.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">XVII. By the words “attacks the Catholic Church,” the said defendants meant and intended and were understood to say, that this plaintiff evilly and maliciously and untruthfully makes public statements with respect to the said Church and its history and public activities, and that he is therefore a maligner and falsifier and is entitled to no respect or credit, which allegations are false, malicious and libelous.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">XVIII. By the words of said letter “misrepresents her teachings,” said defendants meant and intended and were understood to say, that this plaintiff falsely made public statements with respect to the doctrinal teachings and dogmas of said Church which were contrary to the true intent and meaning of the said teachings, doctrines and dogmas, and that plaintiff is himself a false teacher of Biblical and ecclesiastical matters and doctrines, and is unworthy of belief and credit; which allegations are false, malicious and libelous.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">XIX. By the words of said letter “foments religious hatred and bigotry,” the said defendants meant and intended and were understood to say, that this plaintiff willfully and wickedly made publicly statements respecting defendants and the adherents of their sect intended and tending to provoke a breach of the peace on the part of the said parishioners and that plaintiff was guilty of the despicable conduct of stirring up and promoting the evil of sectarian hatred, intolerance and bigotry, while defendants seem oblivious of the hatred and bigotry explicit in their own act of attempt to deprive the plaintiff of the fundamental civic right of freedom of speech and the use of public broadcasting facilities to voice his own legitimate opinions of Bible and Roman Catholic teachings; which charges made against this plaintiff are false, malicious and libelous.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">XX. By the words “take my name off your charge account list, because I will never spend another penny in Gimbel Bros, store,” said defendants meant and intended and were understood to say, that because this plaintiff was allowed under contract with said Station and Gimbel Bros, to broadcast Bible teachings and to express opinions which the defendants were pleased to take as objectionable to themselves and their Church, they and the “very large percentage” of their parishioners referred to, would institute and prosecute a boycott against the said store and station, in order to penalize them for making and performing their contract for broadcasting the addresses of Judge Rutherford, and thus by threats and violence to bring about a breach of said contract and a violation of his legal rights; and by these threats, and many others from themselves and their said parishioners, and further threats of “further and more drastic action” to be taken if said broadcasting were permitted to continue, made by these defendants, they did cause the discontinuance of the said broadcasting and deprived plaintiff of the right further to speak over the said radio station.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">XXI. By the words of said letter “and thereby expose a very large per cent of your customers to open insult and ridicule,” the said defendants meant and intended and were understood to say, that this plaintiff, through his said broadcast addresses, made false and malicious statements with respect to the said Church and its adherents intended and tending to insult and ridicule them and their beliefs, which allegations against this plaintiff are false, malicious and libelous.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">XXII. By means of the committing of all which said several grievances by the said several defendants as aforesaid, the said plaintiff hath been and is greatly injured in his said good name, fame and credit, and brought into public scandal, infamy and disgrace, and exposed to public scorn, ridicule and contempt, with and amongst his neighbors and other good and worthy persons, in so much that divers of those neighbors and persons to whom the innocence and integrity of the plaintiff in the premises were unknown, have, on account of the committing of the said grievances by the said several defendants as aforesaid, from thence have suspected and believed and still do suspect and believe him, the said plaintiff, to have been and to be a person guilty of public untruth and a liar, and to be unworthy of public confidence, faith and credit, to be an evil-disposed and bad character publicly fomenting religious hatred, bigotry and intolerance, and falsely maligning, insulting and ridiculing many good and respectable people because merely of their religious beliefs and practices, and have by reason of the committing of the said grievances by the said defendants as aforesaid, from thence have wholly refused and still do refuse to have any transaction, acquaintance or discourse with him, the said plaintiff, as they were before used and accustoined to have, and otherwise would have had, and the said plaintiff, Joseph F. Rutherford, has been and is by means of the premises otherwise greatly injured, to wit, in the States of New York, Pennsylvania and throughout the United States and elsewhere.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Wherefore the said Joseph F. Rutherford saith that he is injured and has sustained damage to the amount of One Hundred Thousand ($100,000.00) Dollars, actual and punitive damages, and therefore he brings his suit.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dennis Dougherty, James J. Clarke, J. Carroll McCormick, and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia, a corporation, Defendants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">STATEMENT OF CLAIM</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, a Corporation, claims of Dennis Dougherty, James J. Clarke, J. Carroll McCormick, and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia, a corporation, defendants above named, the sum of One Hundred Thousand ($100,000.00) Dollars, actual and punitive damages, upon causes of action whereof the following is a statement:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">I. Plaintiff is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, and having its principal office in the City of Allegheny, in the County of Allegheny, Pennsylvania.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">II. The purpose for which the corporation, which is a non-profitmaking membership corporation without capital stock, is formed, is the dissemination of Bible truths in various languages by means of the publication of tracts, pamphlets, papers and other religious documents, and by the use of all other lawful means which its Board of Directors, duly constituted, shall deem expedient for the furtherance of the purpose stated, including for some years past radio broadcasting, as hereinafter more particularly set forth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">III. Defendant Dennis Dougherty is the Roman Catholic Cardinal Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia and its chief executive officer in matters ecclesiastical and secular; the defendant James J. Clarke is a priest of the Roman Catholic Church and pastor in charge of a church known as Church of Our Lady of the Blessed Sacrament, Holy Ghost Fathers, located at No. 714 North Broad Street, in the City of Philadelphia; the defendant J. Carroll McCormick is a Roman Catholic priest and is Chancellor or secretary of the defendant Archdiocese of Philadelphia; and the defendant Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia is a corporation or juridical personality created under or recognized by the laws of the State of Pennsylvania; and all of the said defendants are residents of the City of Philadelphia, and of the State of Pennsylvania.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">IV. The three defendants other than the defendant Dougherty, who is their superior and directs and controls them, are under the authority of the defendant Dougherty and subject to and owe full obedience to him as head of said Diocese.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">V. Among the duties and activities of the said four defendants and within the actual or assumed scope of their office, authority and employment, are those of promoting the ecclesiastical and material interests of the said Archdiocese and of the Roman Catholic Church therein and in general, and its beliefs, dogmas and teachings, and to prevent and suppress by any means available, including threats, boycotts and other more drastic means, all opposing activities and religious teachings and propaganda, as hereinafter more fully instanced.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">VI. As one of the means or instrumentalities availed of by this plaintiff for carrying on the legitimate purposes expressed in its said Charter granted by the State of Pennsylvania, for more than ten years last past it has actively conducted through its President, Judge Joseph F. Rutherford, and others, a weekly series of addresses on Biblical and religious subjects by radio broadcasts over the Radio Station known as Station WIP, located in the City of Philadelphia, under contracts in writing with the Pennsylvania Broadcasting Company, a Pennsylvania corporation operating said station WIP, which is owned and controlled through heavy pecuniary interest by Gimbel Brothers of Philadelphia.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">VII. The said contracts for broadcasting the addresses of Judge Rutherford and others were annual contracts renewed at the end of each period, the last of which was effective from April 1, 1935, and expiring March 31, 1936, and the same was to have been and would have been then renewed for a further term of one year and indefinitely thereafter but for the unlawful and malicious acts of interference on the part of the several defendants herein, as now more particularly stated.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">VIII. The said several defendants, Dennis Dougherty, individually and as Archbishop and head of the said Archdiocese and on behalf of the same and of the said Roman Catholic Church, the said defendant Archdiocese acting through the said Dougherty and the defendant J. Carroll McCormick as its chancellor and officer, and the defendants McCormick and Clarke as individuals and priests of the said Church and Archdiocese, all and severally actuated by religious hatred, bigotry and intolerance towards this plaintiff and its broadcaster Judge Rutherford and others of its speakers in said broadcasts of addresses in furtherance of the chartered purposes of the plaintiff corporation, in the month of February, 1936, and thereafter prior to and up to the time of the expiration of the then effective broadcasting contract, and for the purpose of interfering therewith and forcing a breach of the same and a refusal by said Broadcasting Company and Gimbel Brothers to renew and continue the same, as they were ready and willing to do and would otherwise have done as requested by this plaintiff, conspired and concerted together to interfere with and cause an unlawful breach of said contract and refusal to renew the same, and to deprive this plaintiff and its officers and public speakers by said broadcasts of their fundamental rights of free speech and public propaganda of their legitimate Biblical and religious teachings and to close their mouths in voicing opinions which the said defendants presumptuously declared to be objectionable to themselves and to their Church and its adherents, did in furtherance and execution of their said malicious conspiracy and concerted wrong against this plaintiff, the following unlawful, malicious and wrongful acts overt in prejudice of the lawful rights and liberties of plaintiff, to wit:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">IX. The defendant James J. Clarke, at the instance and instigation and with the consent and approval of his several co-defendants herein named, did on February 15, 1936, write a certain letter on the letter-heads of the said Church of Our Lady, etc., addressed to Station WFP and to Gimbel Bros., in which said letter he wrote and declared that “As a Catholic Clergyman &amp;&nbsp;as Pastor of the above named Church, in the name of my Parishioners, I protest against you allowing broadcasting facilities to Judge Rutherford next Sunday afternoon at 3 P.M. or any other time”; and he alleged as his “reasons for this protest, that Judge Rutherford attacks the Catholic Church, misrepresents her teachings &amp;&nbsp;foments religious hatred &amp;&nbsp;bigotry,” which said allegations are maliciously untrue, while the clerical author is seemingly oblivious of the religious hatred and bigotry explicit in his demand to silence this plaintiff and Judge Rutherford and to deprive them of their lawful right of freedom of speech simply because the defendants dislike and fear the educative addresses broadcast over the said Station WIP; and said letter further contained a threat of boycott against Gimbel Brothers if they permitted their radio station to carry further broadcasts of Judge Rutherford, it being declared therein, that “If the said Judge is allowed to speak next Sunday afternoon please take my name off your charge account list, because I will never spend another penny in Gimbel Bros store”; and the reverend writer adds in the said letter: “The surprise is that you would allow such a broadcast &amp;&nbsp;thereby expose a very large per cent of your customers to open insult and ridicule,” which said intimation or allegation that this plaintiff or Judge Rutherford spoke or broadcast words intended or tending by any just and reasonable interpretation to expose Roman Catholics to insult or ridicule is untrue; and the said defendant Clarke closed his said letter with the wish and threat, “Hoping you will take the necessary action,” that is, breach your said contract with this plaintiff because of the above-recited threats, and deny plaintiff and its speakers the right of free speech distasteful to these defendants, their hierarchy and Church.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">X. The above letter being delivered on its date to the addressees, Station WIP, and Gimbel Brothers, who justly refused to be influenced thereby to breach their contract and to deny freedom of speech over its broadcasting system and national and international connections used by plaintiff and its speakers for years past, the said several defendants above named, in further execution and as part of their said malicious concert and conspiracy to silence this plaintiff over said Radio System, began and carried on for some weeks an intensive and vituperative campaign of threats of boycott and reprisal against said Station WIP and Gimbel Brothers, for the purpose unlawful and malicious of compelling them to refuse to further renew the said broadcasting contract upon its expiration on March 31, 1936, and to that end and for that unlawful purpose, said defendants procured their parishioners and other adherents, including many of the “very large per cent” of Roman Catholic customers of Gimbel Bros., to write a great number of protesting and threatening letters to the said Station WIP and to Gimbel Brothers, and to make a great many personal visits and telephone calls to them, of like tenor and effect as protests and threats as those in the above-mentioned letter of the defendant Clarke, the exact contents and number thereof being unknown to plaintiff, but the said letters and records of visits and calls are preserved by said Station WIP and by Gimbel Brothers, and will be proved upon the trial of this action.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">XL That as the direct and proximate consequence and result of the said letters, personal visits, telephone calls, protests, threats and fear of boycotts, and of no other circumstances or considerations whatsoever, the said Station WIP and Gimbel Brothers refused the request and offer of plaintiff duly and timely made to them before the expiration of the said contract on March 31, 1936, to renew the said contract</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">and to continue the use of its said broadcasting facilities to this plaintiff ; that plaintiff was willing, ready and able financially and in every wise to renew the said contract and said Station WIP and Gimbel Brothers had promised and agreed to renew and were otherwise willing and ready and able to renew the same, and could and would have done so except for the malicious, intolerant and bigoted interference and threats of the said several defendants hereinbefore named, and plaintiff was thereby and therefore prevented and disabled from continuing its series of broadcasts and was forced to abandon and discontinue the same solely because of the malicious conspiracy and acts of defendants.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">XII. That as the direct and proximate result of the said conspiracy and interference of the defendants, the plaintiff has suffered the loss of a contract very valuable to it in the prosecution of the purposes for which it was chartered, and has suffered great financial loss and damage, and great damage to its credit and prestige as the exponent of Biblical and religious truth, has been greatly hindered and embarrassed in its authorized work, and has been otherwise greatly injured.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">To the damage of the plaintiff in the sum of One Hundred Thousand ($100,000.00) Dollars, and therefore it brings this suit.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">XIII. And for a further and second cause of action, the plaintiff repeats and realleges all of the matters and facts pleaded and set forth in the foregoing Statement of Claim and in Paragraphs I to XII thereof inclusive, with the same force and effect as if again set forth in full herein, and for its further cause of action alleges and says:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">XIV. The right to make and enforce contracts is a legal right secured to plaintiff by virtue of the Constitution and laws of the United States and of the State of Pennsylvania, and particularly by Section 1977 of the Revised Statutes of the United States.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">XV. That by Section 3 of Section 1980 of the said Revised Statutes of the United States, it is provided that if two or more persons in any State conspire for the purpose of depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons (which includes this plaintiff) of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges or immunities under the laws, and that in any case of conspiracy set forth in this section, if one or more persons engaged therein do, or cause to be done, any act in furtherance of the object of such conspiracy, whereby another is injured in his person or property, or deprived of having and exercising any right (including the right to make and enforce contracts) or privilege of a citizen of the United States, the party so injured may have an action for the recovery of damages, occasioned by such injury or deprivation, against any one or more of the conspirators.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">XVI. The defendants above named, Dennis Dougherty, James J. Clarke, J. Carroll McCormick, and Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia, have as above set forth in Paragraphs VIII, IX and X hereof, maliciously conspired together to prevent and by the overt acts therein set forth did prevent this plaintiff from renewing and making the contract for broadcasting mentioned and set forth in Paragraphs VI and VII hereof, and did cause the breach of the contract to renew the same, and from having and exercising the right and privilege of making and renewing said contract and from the right of conducting thereby the purposes for which it was chartered and from deriving the profits and advantages thereby secured to it, whereby plaintiff has suffered the injuries, losses and damages specified in Paragraphs XI and XII hereof and has been deprived of the right of freedom of speech and religious opinions guaranteed to it and its speakers by the Constitution and laws of the State of Pennsylvania and of the United States.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">To the damage of the plaintiff in the sum of One Hundred Thousand ($100,000.00) Dollars, actual and punitive damages, and therefore it brings this suit.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark69"></a>Legal Vindication Against Religious Intolerance </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Joseph Wheless (New York City)</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">rpHE </span><span class="font8">editor of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> asks me, as -L the attorney who prepared both cases, to make a brief explanation of the significance and great importance of the two actions at law just filed in the courts at Philadelphia, by the Watch Tower Society and Judge Rutherford, against “His Eminence” Dennis Cardinal Dougherty, Roman Catholic archbishop of Philadelphia, and several of his co-conspirators against American liberties, the verified pleadings in which suits are published in the present issue of this journal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This I am pleased to do; for seldom, if ever, has so signal an opportunity come to citizens and to courts of this country to vindicate, against bigoted arrogance, such outrages upon the fundamental American rights of freedom of speech and religious liberty as the Roman Hierarchy is now forced, by these vindicative actions, to answer publicly before the tribunals of law and of public opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As the hosts of readers of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> well know through its columns (though not a word of the presumptuous outrage appears either as news or as alarmed protest in the great “free press” of America) the Roman Hierarchy of Philadelphia played a sinister “All Fools” trick last April 1, on the Watch Tower and Judge Rutherford—and on American liberties— when by threats of boycott and through fear it bulldozed Radio Broadcasting Station WIP and its owners, Gimbel Brothers, of Philadelphia, into the cancellation of its ten-year-old broadcasting arrangement for the fearless addresses of Judge Rutherford on Bible truths and the curiosity known as “Catholic truth”. The underlying facts are so fully stated in the pleadings herewith published that I avoid repetition of facts, and simply point out some of the far-reaching legal aspects of the two celebrated causes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Both cases—each for $100,000.00 actual and punitive damages—arise out of the same conspiracy and wrongful acts of the four Hierarchical defendants; but each involves a distinct “cause of action” and distinct principles of law. The action of Judge Rutherford is for libel, or false and defamatory statements in writing, as appear in the photostat facsimile of “Our Lady’s” priest Clarke set out in the pleadings; it is brought in the Federal court by reason of “diversity of citizenship” between the plaintiff and the several defendants. The Watch Tower Society, being a Pennsylvania corporation, must bring suit in the State court, “in trespass” for the malicious interference with its broadcasting agreement with Station WIP and causing the same to be broken and discontinued, which also constitutes a violation of Federal law as set up in its second cause of action, as well as a crime under the Revised Statutes of the United States, Section 5508, carrying a penalty of fine of $5,000 and imprisonment up to ten years. But what hope of an indictment of a Roman “cardinal” by a Romanist district attorney!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The reverend Roman violators of American liberties, in their holy zeal of oppression and suppression, probably did not expect an unterrified American citizen to rise and strike back; evidently they did not contemplate the legal possibilities involved. The libel in Judge Rutherford’s action accuses, that he “attacks the Catholic Church, misrepresents her teachings, and foments religious hatred and bigotry”, oblivious, as the pleadings point out, of the hatred and bigotry of their own attempt to throttle free speech and religious opinions distasteful to their holy selves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The charge “attacks the Catholic Church” by </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">word </span><span class="font6">is preposterous in view of the Catholic Church’s own record of fire and rack and sword attacks on every Protestant and dissident church; it can easily be laughed and shamed out of court, along with its pitiable plea of “foments religious hatred and bigotry”, which is the “Church’s” own specialty, invented and monopolized by itself. But its other curious accusal, “misrepresents her teachings,” is likely to prove a major embarrassment to “Holy Church” when it comes to the proofs in court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In law, the only effective defense in libel is “justification”—not “by faith”, but by legal proofs of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">truth</span><span class="font6"> of otherwise libelous charges. His Eminence and associates, therefore, to escape payment of damages, must specify just what “teachings” of “Holy Church” Judge Rutherford, they say, falsely “misrepresents”; and they must show the court and jury just where, in the Bible itself, those ‘Churchly’ “teachings” find their solid support in the unperverted texts of the Bible. Thus Bible truth, as expounded by Judge Rutherford, will have its day in court, and its vindication as against “Catholic truth” as purveyed by the “Church”. And that day in court promises to be a notable day on its calendar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The other action, that of the Watch Tower Society, for the malicious tampering with its contract rights, and by threats of boycott and of “further and more drastic action”, as threatened by His Eminence himself, involves the most fundamental and sacred civic liberties of American citizens: the rights of free speech and of conscience, of religious belief and opinion. Throughout America, by threats and menaces, by boycotts, censorship, and manifold tyrannous manifestations of “Catholic Action”, the non-Catholic citizenry is subjected to a sinister and persistent campaign of terrorism by the Roman Catholic minority oligarchy in its efforts to “Make America Catholic”, or at all hazards to make it through economic fear supine and subservient before the ruthless march of Romanism towards rule and ruin in our America.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A five-minute talk</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font8">HE scripture at Romans 13 reads: “Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.” Who constitute the “higher powers” here mentioned? Many hold that the officers of the nations or state are the higher powers. Reason alone shows that such claim is not true. The powers in the various nations are at conflict, and all contrary to God. In Russia God and the Bible are completely ignored. In Germany the true followers of Christ Jesus are cruelly persecuted and thrown into prison because they even meet together to study God’s Word. Surely God did not ordain such powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The foregoing text is addressed exclusively to those who have agreed to follow the Lord Jesus Christ. The text is preceded by these words, to wit: To those “beloved of God, called to be saints”. This proves that the text has no reference to worldly governing powers, or officers, but that it is limited to God’s organization. Who, then, are the higher powers of God’s organization? That answer given in the Scriptures is this, to wit: Jehovah God is the supreme power; Christ Jesus the Son of God is His chief officer, to whom God has committed all power ami authority to execute Jehovah’s purposes. It is written (Psalm 62:11) : “Power belongeth unto God.” At Matthew 28:18, Jesus said: “All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.” At John 5, ‘God hath committed unto Jesus all power and authority to execute His judgment.’ The apostles were the first true followers of Christ Jesus on earth, and Jesus sent them forth as His representatives and endowed them with certain specific powers above other men. The apostles, therefore, were by the Lord made visible rulers in the church and constituted a power higher than the others. For that reason the apostle wrote to the church, at Hebrews 13:17: ‘Obey them that have the rule over you; for they watch for your souls as they that must give account.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Everything with Jehovah God is orderly, and He commands those who enter His organization to be orderly and therefore subject to His laws or rules. Anyone who opposes the rules of God’s organization as laid down in the Scriptures is an opponent of God. As further proof that “the higher powers” does not refer to earthly governors, it is written, at Romans 13:3,4, concerning Christ Jesus, the head of the church, and the apostles, to whom specific power was granted : “Rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.” Many of the rulers of nations of earth are a terror to good works. It is certain that God would not ordain some with power to persecute His people and defame His name. The rulers mentioned by the apostle are the ones upon whom Jehovah has laid the obligation to perform duties in His organization. Then the scripture text adds: ‘For he is the minister of God. He beareth not the sword in vain.” Without a doubt this part of the text applies to the Lord Jesus Christ, to whom God has committed power and authority. That Jesus Christ is the one whom God sends forth to execute His judgment it is written (Psalm 45:3,7): “Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, 0 most Mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty. Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is wholly inconsistent to say that the higher powers are those men of the world who hold the offices. The Devil has seized upon this scripture and caused men to misapply it in order to compel men to be subject to all manner of wicked rules and thus cause them to be unfaithful to God. When you get the right view of this text you see that the supreme power is Jehovah and that Jehovah and Christ Jesus are the higher powers and that every person who remains faithful to God must willingly be obedient to such higher powers. Moses was an important man in God’s typical organization and Moses was a type foreshadowing Christ Jesus, concerning whom'it is written, in Acts 3:22,23, that every one who would live must be obedient to this Greater Moses, the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All these Scripture texts prove that those who have become a part of God’s organization by</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">fully agreeing to do the will of God must then, in order to be faithful, be obedient to God at all times. Does that mean that a Christian is disloyal to the country in which he lives and can violate the laws of that country with impunity? No, it means nothing of the kind. The question as to the meaning of loyalty will be considered on another occasion.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">violent in their denunciation. Said one, ‘‘You ought to be arrested for circulating such a thing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some so-called ‘‘Protestants” had more fear of the Hierarchy than the Catholics. They grew pale and hastily closed the interview.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Returning to the editorial first mentioned: It would seem that the indignation among Catholics was not quite as general as the Hierarchy would have the people believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But what about Jehovah’s slanderers? The editorial does not make it clear who are referred to by this statement. Since, however, a slanderer is one who utters falsehoods concerning another, and since the Roman Hierarchy unquestionably teaches doctrines that charge Jehovah with tormenting His creatures after death, and that they may be relieved by prayers and offerings, it must be that they are the ones indicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And now, a petition is being circulated which calls upon the Roman Hierarchy to appoint some representative to debate with Judge Rutherford the question as to whether the Hierarchy and its teachings have been misrepresented by him in his broadcasts. Judge Rutherford is willing to place the matter before the people by broadcasting such a debate over a hookup of radio stations. It is doubtless true that Judge Rutherford has in effect stated that the Hierarchy has slandered Jehovah’s fair name. But he is willing to give them an opportunity to meet him in open debate and to present their defense —if any.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is really a case of Jehovah’s witnesses vs. Jehovah’s slanderers. The editorial mentioned has very little point to it, but it does, apparently, suggest a name for those who have been misrepresenting the great God whose Word declares that He is love.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font8">HE Philadelphia </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Standard -and Times</span><span class="font8"> of May 15, 1936, contained an editorial headed “Jehovah’s Slanderers”. It starts off with a paragraph stating:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A wave of indignation on the part of the Catholic people of Philadelphia and vicinity was provoked by the widespread dissemination of an advertising flyer by the “Jehovah’s Witnesses.’’ The flyer reproduced certain letters of protest sent to Station WIP. The protest was against allowing broadcasting facilities for the “Watch Tower Program’’ on the score that this broadcast “attacks the Catholic Church, misrepresents her teachings and foments religious hatred and bigotry.’’</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19360826_files/g_E_19360826-9.png" alt="" style="width:232pt;height:272pt;">
<p><span class="font5">&quot;Begorra, Cathie, an’ did ye ever see sich a foine medal as 01 got from the ‘holy father’ for me worruk in the movayes?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Sure, Dennis, an’ ’tis a shame ye can’t hang it over the black eye ye got a meddlin’ with WIP.”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">Just why the Catholic people of Philadelphia should object to the reproduction for the benefit of the public of letters of protest which their religious leaders had written to intimidate station WIP is not quite clear. Or that all the Catholic people, or even most of them, were indignant is not quite certain. Information coming to this office, for instance, indicates that quite a goodly percentage of Philadelphia Catholics are definitely in favor of fair play, and that was all the “circular” mentioned, and all the accompanying petition asked for. See </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> No. 439, pages 648-650.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One of those circulating the petition, relating some of his experiences in so doing, mentions the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Elderly woman: “I am a Catholic. I do not subscribe to all Judge Rutherford says, but I’ve signed two petitions for him and I’ll sign this one, too. He has as much right to talk as anyone else.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At one house, two men (one a visitor) said, “We'll sign this; there is nothing wrong with what Judge Rutherford says. I heard him and I know. He can’t make the world any worse than those other guys who are trying to run it. We are Catholics, too.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another man first read the card introducing the petition and asked, “Who is the judge?” Upon being told, “Judge Rutherford,” he immediately signed, saying, “My mother is one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and I am a Catholic.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The few individual Protestants who have not “died” sign the petition gladly—with joy. One woman, who adored her minister, signed because, while she only disliked Jehovah’s witnesses, she hated the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Protestants are very careful to first ascertain that it isn’t for Coughlin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The majority of signers put down their “John Henry ’ ’ when they found out it was to put Judge Rutherford back on WIP —all the while deploring the rampant bigotry of the Roman Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of the Catholic signers, the majority had an honest desire to hear a debate along the lines specified in the petition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A woman refused to sign. The ‘ petitioner ’ gave her the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> issue containing the first of the series of articles on “Philistia—Catholic Action”. She saw the cartoon, ‘War and the Hierarchy’, on the first page (See </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">G. A.</span><span class="font6"> No. 436.) and called the worker back, saying, “I think I will sign this petition. I saw something in this magazine I don’t like.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One man refused to sign because he didn’t want to hear any “priestly rubbish” [his words] over the radio. An explanation cleared up the matter, and he signed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An elderly lady refused to sign at first because Jehovah’s witnesses do not salute flags. Receiving an explanation giving the reason, she signed immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One man refused to sign because he had no interest in either party; said he believed in freedom of speech and conscience. When asked if freedom of speech and conscience was not the willingness to accord to others their rights regardless of personal indifference, he backed down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One Catholic sat on her porch and suffered agonies as she saw her Catholic neighbors sign the petition, one right after another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The petition stung the bigots to fury. They were </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued on page 754)</span></p>

The Yaqui were forbidden their pagan ‘Pascola’ dance about a rag-doll ‘Christ’ and a straw 'Judas’.

And now comes a letter from Archbishop John T. McNicholas, of the archdiocese of Cincinnati, in which he said to his flock: “We wish our priests and people to understand unmistakably that the Knights of Columbus in no sense speak for the priesthood or for the Catholic laity of the archeliocese of Cincinnati on the persecution of religion in Mexico, or on any other subject having religious implications, unless they have a commission from us.” John seems to have concluded that the American people have had about enough of the Mexico bunk for now and that it is just as well to give the K. of C. a kick in the trousers and tell them to pipe down.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">■^■any kind of aristocracy, howsoever primed, is rightly an insult; but if you are born and brought up under that sort of arrangement you probably never find it out for yourself, and don’t believe it when somebody tells you. It is enough to make a person ashamed of his race to think of the sort of froth that has always occupied its thrones without shadow of right or reason, and the seventh-rate people that have always figured as its aristocracies—a company of monarchs and nobles who, as a rule, would have achieved only poverty and obscurity, if left, like their betters, to their own exertions.”</span></p>

In such sections one often has to exchange a booklet for an egg, a piece of cheese, or some dried figs.

And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not [is disobedient], shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: and the rain descended [in the 1 &gt;ay of the Lord], and the floods came [sweeping away the refuge of lies], and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it. —Matthew 7: 22, 23, 26, 27.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark168"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark169"></a>Things Written Aforetime</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">It is of interest to those that hope to be of the royal priesthood that they consider the family of the Jews’ typical high priest, Aaron. His name is variously understood to mean 'mountaineer’ and ‘enlightened’. If of the first origin the reference would seem to indicate his divine selection for the office which he filled. Jehovah God is the Great Mountain, the source from which flow all the streams of truth that refresh His people. The significance of the word ‘enlightened’ is similar. Jehovah God is the light of His people. “Thy word is ... a light unto my path.”—Psalm 119:105; 1 John 1:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Aaron's father was Amram; his grandfather was Kohath; and his great-grandfather was Levi, the third son of Jacob. Aaron’s wife was Elizabeth, daughter of Amminadab, granddaughter of Aram, great-granddaughter of Hezron, and great-great-granddaughter of Pharez, whose father, Judah, was the fourth son of Jacob.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The couple had four sons: Nadab, the name meaning ‘Liberal’; Abihu, meaning ‘Worshiper of God’ </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">[Hebrew:</span><span class="font8"> ‘Father of Him’]; Eleazar, meaning ‘Whom God has helped’; Ithamar, meaning ‘Coast land [i.e., low, level, not high] of the palm tree [symbol of righteousness]’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All four of these sons were named by Jehovah God as the underpriests of Aaron, or, as it were, the members of his body. They thus represented all who are anointed, and, as a matter of fact, it is declared that they </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">icere</span><span class="font8"> all anointed “to minister in the priest’s office”.—Exodus 28:1; Numbers 3:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Nadab and Abihu, the two elders of the four sons, had the best opportunities to be useful in the service of the Most High God, and they had, at the outset the greatest privileges of nearness to the divine presence. With Moses and Aaron and seventy of the elders of Israel they were privileged to see a manifestation of the glory of Jehovah God, and to eat and drink in His presence. Moses alone was privileged to come near to Jehovah’s feet; the other seventy-three were required to ‘worship afar off’; but it was nevertheless one of the grandest privileges ever accorded to any of the sons of men.—Exodus 24:1, 2, 9,10.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark170"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark171"></a>The Sin of Presumption</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">It is not true that </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Nadab</span><span class="font8"> means ‘self-acting’, as has been taught, or that </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Abihu</span><span class="font8"> means, or that Abihu represents, ‘a “great company” of partially faithful spirit-begotten ones’. There is no such thing as being partially faithful. These men represented the “man of sin” that is destroyed from before the Lord. They commit the sin of presumption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.—Psalm 19:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.—1 John 5:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The sense of the word Nadab may be gathered from the root word which is understood in the following passages. A few suggestions are added which may be of some interest or value to the student.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An offering of every man that giveth it </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">willingly </span><span class="font6">with his heart—Exodus 25:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">made icilling,</span><span class="font6"> and they brought [Jehovah’s] offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy-garments. And they came, both men and women, as many as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">were willing</span><span class="font6"> hearted, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold.—Exodus 35: 21, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And they brought yet unto him </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">free</span><span class="font6"> offerings every morning.—Exodus 36: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">willingly</span><span class="font6"> offered themselves.-Judges 5:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">freewill</span><span class="font6"> offering of the people, and of the priests, offering </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">willingly</span><span class="font6"> for the house of their God. —Ezra 7:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">willingly,</span><span class="font6"> because with perfect heart they offered </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">willingly</span><span class="font6"> to [Jehovah].—1 Chronicles 29: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">free</span><span class="font6"> heart, burnt offerings.—2 Chronicles 29: 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thy people shall be </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">willing</span><span class="font6"> in the day of thy power. —Psalm 110: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The vile person shall no more be called </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">liberal.— </span><span class="font6">Isaiah 32: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">liberal</span><span class="font6"> deviseth </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">liberal</span><span class="font6"> things; and by </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">liberal </span><span class="font6">things shall he stand.—Isaiah 32: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now when the prince [faithful prophets of old— </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font6"> Book Three] shall prepare a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">voluntary </span><span class="font6">burnt offering or peace offerings </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">voluntarily</span><span class="font6"> unto [Jehovah], one shall then open him the gate that look-cth toward the east.—Ezekiel 46:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is sufficiently clear that </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Nadal)</span><span class="font8"> means ‘willing&quot; in the sense of generous, liberal, free and noble. Indeed, in Israel’s song in the wilderness, the word is translated “nobles” in the passage where reference is made to the well which the generous-hearted dug for their fellows :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The princes digged the well, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">nobles</span><span class="font6"> of the people digged it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves.—Numbers 21:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The word is also translated “nobles” or “princes” in other passages.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark172"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark173"></a>The Transgression of Nadab and Abihu</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">In all the passages in which Nadab is mentioned Abihu also is mentioned. The honors which they shared in life and the dishonors which they bore in death were joint possessions. That </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Nadab</span><span class="font8"> means ‘generosity toward God’ in the matter of almsgiving seems not open to question, and that </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Abihu</span><span class="font8"> means ‘worshiper of God’ is held by all the lexicographers. What, then, is the significance of the names given beforehand to these children?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before [Jehovah], which he commanded them not. And there went out fire from [Jehovah], and devoured them; and they died before [Jehovah], . . . And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people. ... Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations.—Leviticus 10:1-9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The reasonable inference from the account is that these two men, the one representing prospective priests who trust in their gifts to the Lord’s cause, and the other those who trust in the fact that they believe certain things, and attend meetings and take part in memorial celebrations of the Lord’s death, and are otherwise “worshipers” of God, became intoxicated and disobedient, and were destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is easy enough to get carried away with the thought that in contributing of one’s money one is doing all that should be required, or that in “worshiping” God one is doing all that should be required. In such an attitude of mind one could become intoxicated with the spirit of the world, and therefore with the spirit of the Devil, before realizing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah God will not have any divided hearts or hearts drunken with the spirit of the world. If any are to be of the royal priesthood, their hearts must be wholly undivided and must be wholly His. ‘Thou shalt love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, mind, soul and strength.’— Luke 10:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And true love for God means true obedience to Him; and Nadab and Abihu were disobedient. They forsook the law of their mother.—Proverbs 6:20.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark174"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark175"></a>Consider, the Name Eleazar</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">Every mature child of God realizes that his hope is in God. This is fully borne out by the name Eleazar (‘Whom God has helped’), and the thought is presented in the Scriptures over and over again, in Hebrew words having the same root and the same meaning as the name of this third son of Aaron. Thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And the name of the other [mulatto son of Moses] ■was </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Eliezer; for</span><span class="font6"> the God of my father, said he [Moses], was mine </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">help,</span><span class="font6"> and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.—Exodus 18:4.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark176"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark177"></a>Now Consider Eleazar’s Career</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">It may be fairly assumed that Eleazar was like his name, and that he was stunned when the sudden death of his two older brothers made him the logical successor of Aaron, his father, in the priesthood. It can be set down as certain that he was deeply moved when he was commissioned to gather up the censers of Korah, Dathan and Abiram and the 250 elders that perished in the rebellion of Korah, and plate the altar with them because they were devoted to the Lord. The manifest lesson is that what has been devoted to Jehovah belongs to Him, and not to any other person or thing.—Numbers 16:36-40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Before the death of Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar was entrusted with “the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the daily meat offering, and the anointing oil, and the oversight of all the tabernacle, and of all that therein is, in the sanctuary, and in the vessels thereof”. (Numbers 4:16) There is every reason to know that he did with his might what his hands found to do and that he was wholly acceptable to Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Aaron, his father, because of disobedience, was ordered up into the mountain to die before the Lord, Eleazar was sent along with him, and Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and put them upon Eleazar before Aaron died. This, too, must have been a great responsibility for Eleazar to bear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Eleazar saw his son Phinehas commended by Jehovah God for his zeal in seeing that God's name was not dishonored, and he saw Phinehas promised that because of that he should have an everlasting priesthood. (Numbers 25:1-18) He was one of the three (Joshua and Caleb being the other two) that came out of Egypt and went into the Promised Land. With Joshua he divided the land among the people (Joshua 14:1); he acted as the spokesman for Jehovah God.—Numbers 27:19-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And, finally, as a mark of the express approval of Jehovah God, that his days might be long in the land which God gave to him and to the others with him, he seems to have been the last survivor of those who came out of Egypt, the announcement of his death following that of Joshua, and constituting the last verse of the book which bears the name of that faithful man of God.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark178"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark179"></a>And Now About Ithamar</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">Ithamar’s name, signifying the dow-Iying palm-tree-bearing coast lands’, contains the thought of faithfulness in a less conspicuous place in Jehovah’s organization, but faithfulness none the less. For a summary of the important work entrusted to Ithamar before the death of Nadab and Abihu, see Numbers 4:28-33. In general, it may be said that he was responsible for the transport of all the tabernacle equipment, and it may be assumed that he was faithful to the task entrusted to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Though it is true that one of his posterity, Eli, was deprived of the priesthood, it was after Samuel’s long life had passed, and David’s reign of forty years was ending (probably more than a hundred years all together), that both the priestly houses of Eleazar and Ithamar are mentioned together, as if both were still acceptable to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the twenty-four courses of the priesthood were arranged “there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and thus were they divided: among the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar, according to the house of their fathers. Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.”—1 Chronicles 24:4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The palm tree, recognized in Ithamar’s name, has a prominent place in God’s Word. There is reference to the seventy palm trees at Elim (Exodus 15:27), the palm branches used at the feast of tabernacles (Leviticus 23:40), and the promise that “the righteous shall flourish like the palm tree”. (Psalm 92:12) Palm decorations were plentiful in Solomon’s temple and in the temple seen in Ezekiel's vision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On His triumphal entry into Jerusalem “much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna! Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of [Jehovah]”. —John 12:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And, finally, the great multitude are represented as greeting earth’s new King with palms in their hands. (Revelation 7:9,10) As there were more of the house of Eleazar than of the house of Ithamar, it might seem acceptable that Eleazar would nicely represent the Mordecai-Naomi class of the priesthood and Ithamar the Esther-Ruth class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In any event, it is certain that Nadab and Abihu represent the “evil servant” class that, despite their apparent generosity and apparent attendance upon meetings and the like, are disobedient, careless, drunken with the spirit of the world, and are unfaithful to the high office to which they were called. Their disobedience nullifies their liberality and their worship. For “it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful”.—1 Corinthians 4: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Every devoted thing is most holy unto [Jehovah].” (Leviticus 27: 28) It must be used, and used up, for the purpose for which it was set apart. No one may trifle with, or alter, the promises he has made to Jehovah God.</span></p>
