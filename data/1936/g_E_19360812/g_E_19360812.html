<p><span class="font21" style="font-variant:small-caps;">D</span><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">utch Schultz, New York’s racketeer, missed his calling. He had all the instincts of an international munition maker but lacked the training and the backing to get into the billionaire class of murderers. To be sure, at the close of his earthly life he received the “blessing” of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and was received into the fold and was glorified in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Literary Digest,</span><span class="font11"> but it was too late to do him any good.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19360812_files/g_E_19360812-2.png" alt="" style="width:232pt;height:253pt;">
<p><span class="font9">Preparing to honor future ‘‘Unknown Soldiers”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">The munition maker gets his in this life, and gets it by the billion. Newspapers write what he tells them to write. Popes and prelates are stockholders in his assassination enterprises. Banks do what he tells them. When he speaks governments are silent or reverse their policies. Politicians are his clerks. And when he goes out of this life he literally leaves millions of mourners behind him, including the armless, legless and sightless soldiers and those who went insane as a result of his gangster activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The notion has been widely spread that war makes men manly and that, therefore, since the making of munitions is necessary to modern warfare, it is a calling that is in every way honorable. But in these days there are some who see differently, and occasionally there is even one such among the clergy. The following is from the pen of the Anglican clergyman Dean</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Inge, in his work </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Christian Ethics and Modern Problems:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“The notion that war is good for the virility of a nation is absolutely untrue, at least under modern conditions. The courage which it evokes it did not implant ; the injury which it does to the racial stock continues to impair the quality of the race for many generations. There is no difference of opinion among eu-genists on this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Thucydides tells how an Athenian ungenerously taunted a Spartan prisoner by asking him whether all their brave men had been killed. ‘ ‘ The arrow would be a useful weapon,” was the reply, “if it picked out the best men to hit. ’ ’ So would the bullet. An epigram in the Greek Anthology says bluntly that the war-god spares not the good, but the bad.... This is more true of modern than of ancient war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“The effect of war,” says Professor Starr Jordan, writing in the year before the Great War, “is to spoil the breed by the simple process of the reversion of selection.” . . . Nations have always chosen for war the best men they could get, and they have always got better than those whom they left at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This counter-selection was one cause of the decline of Greece and Rome, and in the same way at the beginning of the modern period the vigorous race of Spaniards was enfeebled by war and persecution. “Castile makes men and wastes them,” says an old writer. Some persons naively expressed surprise that after a hundred years of peace in Europe Englishmen fought better than ever. And yet Japan, after two hundred years of peace, has astonished the world by the valor of her soldiers in her war with Russia. Napoleon “peopled Hades with the elite of Europe”; the evil which he did can never be measured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Starr Jordan thinks that the United States has never fully recovered from the dysgenic slaughter of the Civil War from 1861 to 1865, in which nearly one in thirty of the whole population lost their lives. The statement often repeated that the Napoleonic War lowered the average height of Frenchmen, some have said by three inches, seems to be untrue; but there is no doubt that the war increased defects and infirmities in the next generation. That “war children” tend to be inferior was known before the Great War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is really no doubt whatever that war, next to wholesale class-bribery by taxation, is the most dysgenic factor in modern life. I cannot refrain from quoting the vigorous language in which Santayana (in 1905) emphasizes this truth, preaching, alas! to deaf ears: ‘ ‘ There are panegyrists of war who say that without a periodical bleeding a race decays and loses its manhood. Experience is directly opposed to this shameless assertion. It is war that wastes a nation’s wealth, kills its flower, narrows its sympathies, condemns it to be governed by adventurers, and leaves the puny, deformed, and unmanly to breed the next generation. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It happens also in the educational field that there is here and there a guide of youth who is not influenced by the golden tide that flows into the coffers of the munition makers. Thus Dr. G-. Bromley Exnam, president of DePauw University, is quoted in the Indianapolis </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font11"> as saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Propaganda traceable directly to munition makers states there is Communism in American colleges. But who are the munition makers? They are men who profiteered when American soldiers were dying in France. They are selling war supplies to potential enemies at this moment. Research conducted by college professors has brought their treachery to light. They would discredit the colleges. Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Gigantic power corporations, through subsidized propaganda, state that Communism is rampant in American colleges. Why? Read the testimony given before the Federal Trade Commission. Why have power corporations sought to control newspapers, to subsidize and thereby control educational institutions, and to gain control of legislative institutions that should be dedicated to the common good? College research has revealed the menacing nature of these unpatriotic activities that are in fact destroying democracy. Hence, a subtle, cowardly and indirect attack upon our institutions of higher learning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Selfish reactionaries, with no constructive answer to the terrible problems of unemployment, sickness and old age, subsidize so-called patriotic societies, and these in turn propagandize the nation. They call proposals to eliminate child labor, to reduce unemployment, to provide for disability due to sickness, and to care for old age, communistic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Making the World Safe’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When the munition makers saw their dreams coming true in 1914 and realized that there would be a great market for their wares if the war could be kept going, they did all that was humanly, and one could almost say, inhumanly possible to whip up enthusiasm for a cause in which their pawns, the common people, had little interest or little desire to participate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Every statesman on the side of the Allies insisted with all his lung power that the World War was fought to make a better w’orld, one that would have no militarism; there would be permanent peace. The net result for Uncle Sam was a debt of $32,000,000,000, and the net results for the world were Stalin, Hitler, Horthy, Mussolini, and more to follow soon. Making the world safe for hypocrisy was surely expensive. On March 31, 1917, the federal debt of the United States was $1,282,044,346. On March 16, 1936, it was $31,859,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When it became apparent to the munition makers that Italy would strangle Ethiopia there was great happiness in their midst. All the things that would help men to kill one another went like hot cakes. This was a great comfort to clergymen holding munition shares. Cotton linters, used in making explosives, were at an all-time high, and so was the trade in scrap iron, useful for many war purposes. In 1934 the French purchased 25,494 tons of benzols (useful for explosives), as against 9,284 tons the year before. Metallic cartridges, rifles, machine and heavy ordnance guns, explosives, projectiles and gunpowder were in great demand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The munition makers are always on the job when there is a chance to sell something wherewith one man may take the life of another, or a million men take the lives of a million, but they sometimes err. They recently lost 537 barrels of guns at Palestine. Plans were laid to smuggle in the guns as cement. When half the drums had been landed, one was found damaged. It was opened and found packed with revolvers and cartridges. The other drums were also opened. Nobody claimed them. Billionaire gangsters cannot afford to get caught.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Item: The Savage Arms Company, one of the lesser firms of munition makers, reported sales for the year 1934 as $2,336,662.48.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Bids for Cannon Fodder</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">From the time that the knights went to battle on horseback looking like a Baltimore heater with a teakettle on top of it the makers of armor plate, guns, bullets and other war junk have appealed to the vanity of men and women to help them increase the market for their goods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There are plenty of men that for the sake of donning a uniform would do things to which they would never otherwise stoop, and there are plenty of women who rejoice to have their sons butchered so that they can boast and get their names in the papers. However, some of the mothers have both hearts and brains. Airs. Frieda Wandless, Camden, N. J., seems to be one of these. In a letter to the Camden </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Courier,</span><span class="font11"> January 12, 1936, she said:</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19360812_files/g_E_19360812-3.png" alt="" style="width:234pt;height:261pt;">
<p><span class="font9">MOTHERS! Cover yourselves with GLORY—• Trade in your best son, and receive a GOLD STAR in exchange.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">War is the ignoble trick of slitting open the blood vessels of the excited working class to “satisfy” the “honor” and save the pride and business of crowned and uncrowned cowards of the ruling class. There never is a war and never can be a war until the workingmen are willing to do the marching, the trench-digging and the actual fighting, bleeding and dying. And the workingmen are never willing to butcher and be butchered wholesale until the capitalist class or “highly educated” hirelings of the capitalist class craftily or ignorantly excite the humble toilers to the fiend's stupid mood of savage hate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">First come the powerful editorials, the “great speeches, ’ ’ the eloquent sermons, and prayers for war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then the fife and drum, then the brainstorm of the humble, humbugged workingmen, then the recruiting, then the hand-waving and “good-bye boys, good-bye,” then the butchering and the blood, then the tears and taxes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But every lily-fingered snob, every socially gilt-edged coward, every pro-war preacher, every selfexempting political shark and every well-fed money glutton, who dares help excite the working class for the hell of war—these, every one of these, in case of war, should be forced to dance on the firing line to the hideous music of the cannon’s roar until his own torn carcass decorates a “great battle” field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I have taught my son that the most degrading thing a man can do is to become a soldier. He will not assassinate some other mother’s son and then hide his stained fists in the folds of a flag and call it patriotism.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Veterans of Future Wars, started at Princeton University as a satire on militarism and hypocrisy, has grown to 360 posts with 30,000 members-; one post in every state except Nevada.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">The future Veterans say their organization is permanent and that the next time Hearst and the munition makers and bankers want to drag the United States into a war, they will have something to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The young men at the Presbyterian Theological Seminary at Omaha, Nebraska, have organized the first chapter of Chaplains of Future Wars, and thereby greatly amused and encouraged those who got such huge satisfaction out of the organization of the Veterans of Gold Star Mothers of</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Veterans of Future Wars. All the hypocrites are getting sore now at the boys and girls that are on to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In Germany, Italy and other countries which are villeinholds of the munition makers the preparation of cannon fodder begins while the child is playing with his toys. In San Diego last winter the toystores carried motorized field artillery tanks and machine guns. In Chicago the collection and burning of toy guns from school children resulted in six hundred less accidents from guns in 1935 than in 1934. Parents can turn such symbols of war and hate into effective object lessons by telling the children something (not all) of the horror they represent.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Methods of Murderers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">It is not often that one gets a chance to read the letter of a would-be murderer, before the murder is committed. Here is one by Federal Laboratories, Inc., Pittsburgh, Pa., to its agent in Minneapolis:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“We have ordered the Cudahy Packing Co. clips (for machine guns) shipped from auto-ordnance direct to the sheriff of Washington County. lie will have to give us Affidavit No. 3 on this shipment and it must come immediately. Otherwise we’ve got to get the proper order from Cudahy Packing Co., and run through a complete new shipment, returning the other clips. ... We believe the Government will approve shipping these clips to Cudahy, but if they want extra clips, that is just what has to be done, even though a previous order went through because they are not a law-enforcement body. I am counting on you not getting us in ‘dutch’ on this.” [But he did.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Senate Munitions Committee, after two years of investigation of methods of the munition makers in contacting officials of the War and Navy departments, excoriated their methods, saying, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Almost without exception, the American munitions companies have at times resorted to such unusual approaches, questionable favors and commissions, and methods of ‘doing the needful’, as to constitute in effect a form of bribery of officials or their close friends in order to secure business.” . . . Such methods were “highly unethical, a disgrace to American business and a reflection upon those American governmental agencies which have unwittingly aided in the transactions so contaminated.” . . . “Throughout the World War, the munitions companies insisted on their pound of flesh and did not let patriotism stand in the way of profits. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The evidence before the Senate Munitions Committee showed that the munition makers not only conspired with manufacturers to jeopardize the lives of their employees and repeatedly bribed officers of the government itself, but they even double-crossed their own countrymen in the maimer set forth in the following citations:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">‘ ‘ The committee finds, from official documents which it has not entered into the record, that the sales of munitions to certain South American nations in excess of their normal capacity to pay, was one of the causes for the defaults on certain South American bonds, and that the sales of the munitions were, in effect, financed by the American bond purchasers, and the loss on the bonds was borne by the same people. ’ ’</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>“These Superior Minds”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">In time of war (more likely than not brought about through their connivance with politicians and military men) the munition makers suddenly become, in the eyes of the press, the clergy and the people, the superior minds of the country. H. M. Tomlinson writes interestingly of these in his book entitled </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Mars His Idiot:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">These superior minds to whom we so innocently confide our destinies—is it not strange that their “superiority” in public life exhibits itself in disastrous imbecilities that would land the private individual in the booby hatch if he were guilty of such conduct in his private life? Isn’t it about time that we ceased to pay them such unmerited respect? It may be time, and past time; but we don’t seem to have learned it. The tendency, indeed, is to concede them an even more imquestioning obedience, in the name of the state—which is precisely the name they conjured with in 1914.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Through the hearings of the Senate Munitions Committee the names of some of the leading domestic customers of the munition makers have become known, i.e., Weirton Steel Company, Cudahy Packing Company, H. C. Frick Coke Co., Southern Natural Gas Co., Tennessee Coal, Iron and Kailroad Corporation, and the Gulf States Steel Company. Some of the concerns did not wish it known that they are buying poison gas and Thompson machine guns, revolvers, etc. All the concerns named are very patriotic and would salute the flag instanter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The munition makers have proved not only that they are willing to promote bloodshed between nations and to help shoot strikers into submission, but that they certainly must share at least a measure of responsibility for a situation which has developed in the United States where “the armaments of crime in revolvers, machine guns, and sawed-off shotguns exceed the total side-arm equipment of the government’s soldiers and sailors”; and where “the armed forces of gangdom outnumber the 200,000 men in our army and navy”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Nothing that will provide revenue is overlooked. Thus, bullet-proof vests are provided for those who can afford them and who feel the need of them. The salesmen of these vests have to have good nerves. Their method of demonstrating their wares is to let a guard fire three rifle shots at them. If the bullets are deflected by the vest, then it is a good vest; if not,—well, it hasn’t happened yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But the major business of the munition makers is war. Defining war as a racket, General Smedley D. Butler, America’s best-known military man, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A racket is best described as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people. Only the “inside” group knows what it is about. It is conducted for the benefit of the very few at the expense of the very many.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>Britain a Munition Center</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">While the United States is a great munition manufacturer, Great Britain is a manufacturing country and specializes in munitions. War always brings temporary prosperity to those countries furnishing the munitions. The arming of Italy for the Ethiopian conflict put large sums of money in circulation in Britain; so much so that in the month of July 1935 the railroads carried over 6,000,000 more people than in July 1934, while railway receipts showed an increase of over £400,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Sir Harry Duncan McGowan, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., stated in his testimony before a royal commission that he had no objections at all to selling arms to both sides, and that peace was not his job.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">It is interesting to know that the vice-president of the Young Men’s Christian Association of Great Britain holds 20,000 shares of stock in the munitions firm of Imperial Chemical Industries. This seems quite appropriate, in a way, for in the World War the Y.M.C.A. was to be found on all fronts, actively peddling tobacco and such other<sup>-</sup> things as they have for sale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The London </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Herald</span><span class="font11"> publishes a list of the thirteen concerns engaged in the munition business in Britain and points out how £500 invested a year ago in five British firms would by today have made a profit of £4,600. It seems only fair that in the event of war those who made this profit should be in the front lines.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>Some of the Latest Inventions</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">Within a radius of ten miles from the operating station, Britain is now able to send up robot planes that will go up 10,000 feet, fly 100 miles an hour, go through dives and rolls and other feats of a piloted plane and return safely to the ground. Washington Army spokesmen see no practical value in the device, for the reason that there is no way for a pilotless plane to determine where the target is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Flying Flea, the world's smallest navigable airplane, crossed the English Channel August 13 in 52 minutes. It has a wing span of twelve feet, a twentyhorsepower engine, and carried 4½ gallons of gasoline, sufficient to carry it 180 miles. It stands only breast high and its cruising speed is 60 miles an hour. It is navigable only in calm weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The spray gun (invented in Czechoslovakia) will enable a single fighting plane to spray a whole squadron at once; it fires bullets on the blunderbuss principle, shooting with equal effect at every plane within range.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At hand a picture of Sir Herbert A. Lawrence weeping over the Menin Gate, Belgium, whereon are inscribed the names of 58,600 British soldiers butchered at Ypres. Lawrence was weeping over the wrong thing. He is chairman of the billion-dollar Vickers-Armstrong firm, with war munition plants scattered all over the world. Instead of weeping over a gate he should do his weeping over his guns, at his factories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The common people of Great Britain, those who would be slaughtered in event of another world war, are interested just now in the aspect of a war-mad and highly armed Germany, and the fact that large numbers of military planes of British manufacture were sold to Germany with the full knowledge and consent of the British air ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Awaiting the return trips of planes sold by and with the connivance of their own militarists, the British Government has issued elaborate instructions for the accumulation of gas masks, protective clothing and “decontaminating” powder: there will be a national school of instruction in anti-gas drill, air-raid warnings, and rescue and repair work, which are expected to be necessary when the air over Albion is made black with the wings of hostile planes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Describing Europe’s darkened cities, in anticipation of air raids, Walter Duranty says of the people that</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">. . . their hearts are anguished by terror of the future and by memories of the past. Greater and faster airplanes, bigger and better bombs, newer and deadlier gases—the people think of that as they slink along the darkened streets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The experts working on the poison gas problem have not yet been able to discover how to save a baby from suffocation when the parents working the pump which supplies air to the baby are killed or disabled and unable to work it longer. The theologians who think these poison gas nations are part of Christ’s government will make a careful study of just what Christ could really have meant by taking little children up into His arms and blessing them.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Munitions a Barometer of Prosperity</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">It seems too bad to have to say it, but it appears that the prosperity of Great Britain is largely bound up in the munition business. In the years of comparative prosperity, from 1928 to 1933, British exports shrank from £844,000,000 to £416,000,000; shipping revenue sank from £130,000,000 to £65,000,000; income from foreign investments sank from £270,000,000 to £155,000,000, and income from insurance and banking services sank from £65,000,000 to £30,000,000. Thus the fountain of England’s prosperity dried up from a total of £1,309,000,000 income for her four principal streams to £666, 000,000, or only a little more than half.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">With the prospect of an Italian attack upon Ethiopia there was marked and immediate improvement, so that within two or three months from the date when it was certain that Mussolini would make the attack (midsummer of 1935) there were more persons employed in Britain than at any previous time within fourteen years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This feeling of prosperity extended from the British people to the British government, so that by defaulting on the payment of her obligations to the United States Britain was able to expend on armaments £34,000,000 more than in the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Militarism grows by what it feeds upon, and the sale of war munitions to Japan comes back to plague the British authorities at Singapore. Japanese spies have been detained there; one died while being “cross-examined”; the port was closed to foreign soldiers, sailors and airmen; army, navy and airforce maneuvers were held amid greatest secrecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">An interesting sidelight on the current prosperity in the war munitions market is afforded by an expression in a letter of a subscriber who wishes to remain unknown. He is connected with one of the great soap concerns of the world. He states that one of the by-products of the soap company with which he is connected is glycerin, and at the time of his writing glycerin was practically off the market, being absorbed by the munition manufacturers as fast as it could be produced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When business is good in the manufacture of munitions of war the government receipts from income taxes are higher than in normal years; but that is like feeding oneself by sucking the blood from a gaping wound. In the fiscal year 1932-1933 there were 84,175 persons in Great Britain each with income in excess of £2,000 a year. The total income of the 84,175 persons was £441,101,427, and the income tax thereon was £47,750,450, which is about 10.8 percent.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>Militarism Leads to Fascism</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">The standing armies and reserves of Europe are now estimated as follows: Britain 1,337,000, Germany 1,600,000, Italy 2,229,000, Russia 3,800,000, France 4,684,000, Denmark, 37,000, Lithuania 50,000, Bulgaria 56,000, Hungary 70,000, Sweden 80,000, Norway 135,000, Holland 135,000, Greece 137,000, Austria 270,000, Yugoslavia 290,000, Spain 360,000, Rumania 380,000, Czechoslovakia 390,000, Switzerland 495,000, Belgium 667,000, Poland 973,000; total 18,175,000. These dangers of the world have between them at least 19,629 planes, of which Britain has 1,750, Germany 2,800, Russia 3,000, Italy 3,700, and France 4,000. No wonder Europe has a headache.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Stripped of the glamor that surrounds them, Fascists are merely salesmen or advance agents for the munition makers; and, disappointing as it is to have to say it, Fascism, i.e., Catholic Action, is making headway in the most democratic country in the world. In the Fast End of London a Jewess asked one of Mosley's men to desist from writing on the walls of her own home ‘‘Kill the Jews”, whereupon the Blackshirt spat in her face. This is really the full size of Fascism, or Nazism, or Catholic Action, wherever it appears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Fascism is merely a return to the hated forms of government when the dictators of long ago, the Caesars, the Charlemagnes and the Napoleons, led millions of men along ‘the path of glory’ to the grave and left behind them the agonized cries of women and children bereft of their caretakers. The lying publicity agents directly or indirectly under the control of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy never cease to hold up militarism for the admiration of what was once a deluded populace. It is not as easy as it once was, because something is happening to the heels of the war horses. (Genesis 49:17-18) In the New York </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">World-Telegram </span><span class="font11">Westbrook Pegler writes of the efforts still put forth by the</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The “proeperity” of 1935-1936</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">Devil to make militarism popular with the men and with the ladies, even in the days of poison gas. He said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is no question that the gunmen now occupy the highest position in the regard of people, for when it came to burying King George and the nations of the world were asked to send representatives they sent professional killers, and the splendor of their uniform so filled the public eye and mind that the wasted little man lying in the box on a gun carriage was only the occasion for the display. The highest honors which it is possible to bestow are reserved for warriors, and they wear the most beautiful costumes that the world can produce. Some of them, like the savages, wear feathers on their hats; and the more feathers and the more gaudy the feathers, the greater the killer. Some wear pink hats, some blue, some green; some wear fur trimmings, and a few dress up in breastplates and helmets of real gold, with plumes of while horsehair trailing down their necks. A certain English type of warrior wears white leather breeches and high black boots which are lined with white leather. Certain others in Scotland and the Balkans wear skirts. Nowadays in Europe various nations recognize that the professional killer’s mentality is such that he feels depressed in ordinary clothes but is stimulated by beautiful costumes, and therefore in Austria, for example, certain officers are wearing white greatcoats, lined with scarlet, and black top boots with silver spurs. Even Soviet rulers are adopting beautiful red uniforms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fascism Leads to Cruelty</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Prisons are an invention of the Devil. Pad as is the reputation of British prisons for cruelty, these places where man discloses his inhumanity to man will be much worse under Fascism than they now are; but they are now bad enough, as one may discern from the following details of floggings as they occur in British prisons, supplied by the International News Service:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The cat, a 28-inch corded whip, composed of nine strips each interspersed with knots every six inches, on a short handle, is usually administered in doses of 12, 18, 24 or 36 strokes on the back of a criminal, stripped to the waist and tied to a steel tripod-like whipping post. Floggings are carried out in a part of the prison well away from the cells. If more than 12 strokes have been ordered, two wardens, one using the right arm and the other the left, alternately wield the lash. A prison doctor always is in attendance at a flogging, and after each stroke of the cat he examines the criminal to see if the man can stand the strain of further punishment. . . . Several criminals have committed suicide sooner than face the punishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Bad as arc social conditions now, they will be much worse if, as and when Fascism (militarism—Catholic Action) gets control of Britain. As it is, British health authorities have taken note of the fact that between 80 percent and 90 percent of babies are born sound and well, but that by the time they are of school age 30 percent to 40 percent of them are defective. This situation will now be studied to see what can be done to correct it. It is discerned that these defectives are, for the most part, the children of badly housed and overworked mothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">British magistrates have recently penalized a father who thrashed an ill and delirious sevenyear-old son; a mother who tied her seven-year-old son with his ankles bound to his wrists; another mother who deliberately scalded her child; a foster mother who literally covered a baby girl with bruises; and parents who kept a child so long in a box-chair that the child grew to the shape of the chair. It is observed that fathers are more prone to treat their children cruelly than mothers. All together, more than 500 parents were sent to prison for cruelties to their offspring. These cruelties are mostly in the slum districts, where there is no place for the children to play outside the home and there are no real comforts for any persons in the home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Under present social conditions the munition makers and their office boys, the politicians, and their “blessers”, the clergy, have more than heart could wish. (Psalm 73:7) But the common people, millions of them, do not live, but merely exist, and under Fascism their condition is bound to become very much worse. As respects present conditions Colin Campbell, chairman of the National Provincial bank, one of Britain’s five big banks, in his annual address to the shareholders, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“It has been estimated that if the undernourished classes in this country were able to enjoy a full diet there would be increased trade in foodstuffs amounting to about £200,000,000 a year, giving revived activity to British farming without harming the oversea trade or shipping. ’ ’</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>“Deliverance”—What a Contrast</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">With the foregoing in mind, let the honest-hearted contrast the above terrible conditions and the worse ones that are quite likely just ahead with the following from pages 356-359 of Judge Rutherford’s book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance,</span><span class="font11"> and explain, if they can, why the distributors or publishers of this literature are thrown into prison by Fascist-minded members of the strong-arm squad at the behest of the clergy, and surely with the consent of the munition makers and their liegemen, the politicians:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The prophet of God likens the kingdom on earth to two great mountains, the one on the north and the other on the south, with a great valley between, known as the valley of blessings, the valley of happiness.—Zechariah 14:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is the spring of the thirtieth century. A thousand years have passed since The Nation was born. A day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years are as one day. (2 Pet. 3: 8) Come to the mountain, that from there we may take a view of the valley of blessing. Observe that the sun shines in that valley from morning until evening. It is always bright in that valley. Look at the indescribable combinations of colors, both of flowers and of trees. Everything has life. The cherry trees are in bloom, likewise the orange and magnolia ; the roses, the hyacinths, the carnations, the honeysuckles and many like beautiful flowers line the valley, sprinkling with smiles its green velvet carpet. The air is laden with sweet perfume, wafted by the soft south wind that sings through the trees. It is the mating time, and the little birds are vying with each other in singing songs of felicitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hark! There comes the sound of tramping multitudes. From every point of the compass great streams of humanity pour into the valley. They are marching in perfect order, but there is a complete absence of the military air. They are bearing neither gun nor sword nor any other instrument of defense or offense. Now such things would be entirely out of place. They are relics of an almost-forgotten past. See, there is but one cannon; and the bluebirds are nesting in its mouth with no fear of ever being disturbed. Mark with what buoyancy of step the people walk. There are among them no lame, no halt, no blind, no deformed ones. No, there is not even an old man among them. Where are the old folks? These have been restored to the days of their youth, and their flesh has become as fresh as a babe’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are no poor there, no beggars among them, nor by the wayside. No, not now, because all have plenty. There are no sick nor afflicted there; no, because all enjoy health and strength. There are no vicious, nor cold, hard faces amongst them; no, not these, because they have all come over the highway and reached the end thereof and have been fully restored. See, their faces are all wreathed in smiles. On comes host upon host. They are bearing numerous banners, and upon each one are inscribed the words: “Holiness unto the Lord.” (Zech. 14:20) Both men and women are grace and beauty personified. Yes; they are now all of the royal house, because they are children of theKing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is a perfect day, and everything of creation bears the mark of perfection. Wafted over the valley come the strong, clear, sweet tones of a silver trumpet. At its call the great multitude kneels in silent thanksgiving to God. Another sound of the silver trumpet and there are heard the perfect voices of multitudes, and now in complete harmony they are singing: “Deliverance is complete; praise God!”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>The “New Deal” in Great Britain</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">A long step in the direction of Fascism in Great Britain is the creation of special boards stipulating how much the fanner shall grow, and how much shall be marketed, and what the price and size of potatoes and other products must be. I. Hillier, Isle of Wight, referring to England’s Milk Board swindle, says that it “has pushed the price of milk up to 2s. 2d. per gallon (6½d per cjuart) retail and 3½d. per gallon only for milk chocolate manufacture, etc. The Milk Board is now virtually owner of one-fifth of all the dairy farms and cows in the country ; not a bad rakeoff without any money involved. They are now on a potato ramp, levying a tax of £5 on potato growers; for this amount they will fix a price for potatoes and size of riddle over which they must pass. They are now debating their remuneration. There are also pig boards, egg, bacon and beef, etc., anything to make the lot of the poor poorer and the rich richer, seems it.”</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19360812_files/g_E_19360812-6.png" alt="" style="width:231pt;height:270pt;">
<p><span class="font7">A glorious conversation between a glorious munition maker and the glorious Rattl on the glorious occasion of the glorious wounded of the most recent glorious war gloriously staggering under the newly built glorious triumphal arch.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font7">Munition maker: What would the common man do to gain distinction without me? My, my, just look at all the medals!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Papa: What glory is yours—and mine! Let us not forget the millions of dead—.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Munition maker: Course not. Won’t hurt not to. How about a national shrine—unknown soldier stuff, you know? I’ll contribute a dollar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Papa: I was wondering who would pay for the masses for all these millions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Munition maker: You still fooling around with them masses? Seems to me, what with your profit from our gilt-edge stock, you should be satisfied without asking me. Oh, well, I’ll contribute a dollar. Let their relatives pay as usual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Papa: A dollar hardly covers it. You forget who I am. Munition maker: O.K., Hog! Here’s $2 to shut up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Papa: (Moving off) He’ll pay for this. I’ll sick the Jesuits on him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Munition maker: (Under his breath) The greedy swine. Never satisfied. I’ve a good notion to send him one of our latest-type time bombs.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">This effort to boost the prices of things (for the benefit of the big business crowd) is similar to the Papal AAA arrangement in the U.S.A. The net result was that the poor of Britain, who, as elsewhere, live largely on potatoes, had to pay twice as much for their food in April 1936 as before. Somehow their pay seems not to have been doubled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">However, these hungry and undernourished and ill-clad millions will doubtless forget their troubles when they see or read or hear about the coronation of the king, whose full regalia consists of the spurs, the scepter with the cross, the pointed sword of temporal justice, the pointed sword of spiritual justice, the sword of mercy, the sword of state, the scepter with the dove, the orb, St. Edward’s crown, the paten, chalice and Bible. The vestments are the amice, the colo-biuni sidonis, the supertunica, the armilla and the imperial mantle. It is appropriate to have the king well supplied with swords. This emblem of the munition makers appears in four different forms in the coronation ceremonies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Then, too, why worry about the price of milk and potatoes and other nonessentials, when it is known that the prospective heir to the British throne, the son of the duke and duchess of Connaught, was properly baptized with water from the Jordan, at 3s. 6d. for a half pint, and that the clergy who performed the “service” included the archbishop of Canterbury, the bishop of London, and another ghostly adviser? It seems annoying that so many folks are always thinking about milk and bread and potatoes and other mundane things when it should be understood that the clergy and the kings and queens are busy attending to “more important” matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Not that royalty is unwilling to come down to the common level, when it seems expedient. For instance, an item in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Universe,</span><span class="font11"> January 24, 1936, states that in September, 1931, the new king of England, then prince of Wales, visited the Roman Catholic grotto of Lourdes, and at the proper signal knelt in the mud along with all the others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The general trend toward Fascism is likewise a trend toward Catholicism, and the foregoing concession to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is of a piece with the fact that the kings of England apparently no longer take an oath at their coronation to resist the encroachments of the Hierarchy. King G eorge V did not take this oath, and during his reign diplomatic relations between Britain and the Vatican were established. Incidentally, the duke of Norfolk, whose hereditary right it is to plan all the details of a royal funeral and to stand next to the king on the occasion of the coronation, assisting in placing the crown upon his head, is a Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Fascism does not interfere with the munitions business, as has been noted. Nor does it set aside the king business. It rather leads to the greater security of those who can trace their descent to one or another royal dictator. It is interesting, in this connection, to note that the following present and past rulers of Europe trace their descent to King George III, whose dictatorial and Fascistic tendencies made him the villain of American school histories of a bygone day: Leopold III, of Belgium; Kaiser Wilhelm II, late ruler of Germany; King Carol of Rumania; King Peter II of Yugoslavia; Nicholas II, the last czar of Russia; the crown prince Gustaf Adolf, of Sweden; King Alfonso XII, late king of Spain; King Haakon VII, of Norway; and King Edward VIII, of England.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>Thwarting Fascist Crop Reduction</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">Just when the British New-Dealers thought they had crops limited sufficiently to insure the speculators a “reasonable” profit on their investments, up bobs a farmer at Babingley Hall, King’s Lynn, Norfolk, W. Parker by name, who now grows an oat that has no husk and hence has a yield automatically increased by 50 percent. These oats, sown at 45 pounds per acre, instead of 168 pounds for ordinary oats, produce an average yield of 24 hundredweight, equal to 36 hundredweight of ordinary oats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In spite of difficulties such as these the Woolworth Company, which has 600 stores in Britain, is still making huge profits. Since 1931 the total profits on the British stores amount to more than £18,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Anglo-Persian Oil Company seems also to be doing quite well, thanks to the Ethiopian massacre. In the London </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Herald</span><span class="font11"> Francis Williams remarks that in the next dividends of that company there should be a nice extra sum earned by the British government in helping Italy to bomb defenseless Ethiopian villages. Britain owns 56 percent of the stock of the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is affirmed that as late as December 12, 1935, a British oil company was still supplying oil to Italy. June 18, 1936, Foreign Minister Eden expressed his intentions to put an end to “sanctions” altogether, and they did end July 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">British sympathy with Italy is not altogether lacking. These nations appear to have similar objectives, and Britain cannot be wholly indifferent to the flattery of imitation. In fact, in some respects the British are but carrying out what Rome, in its history, has exemplified, and may, with the United States, well be referred to as “the noblest Romans of them all”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Says Bertrand Russell in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Reader's Digest:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When, for example, the Transvaal was found to contain gold, the British invaded it. Lord Salisbury assured the nation that “we seek no gold fields”. But somehow or other we happened to go where gold fields were, and to find ourselves in possession of them at the end of the Boer war. Everybody knows that the British went to southern Persia from a desire to benefit the southern Persians, but it is doubtful if we should have taken so much interest in their welfare if they had not inhabited a country full of oil. Not dissimilar remarks might be made about some of the doings of the United States in Central America. In like manner, the motives of Japan in Manchuria are the noblest possible; but they happen, by some curious accident, to coincide with the interests of the Japanese.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>No Intention to Let Go</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">Nor has Britain any intention to let go what she has thus far been successful in seizing possession of. Hence she prizes her military and naval organizations and rewards those who render<sup>-</sup> conspicuous service. Those who give their lives get medals, cenotaphs and memorial services, while those who gave directions are rewarded in a more temporal way. The commander-in-chief of her military forces in France, Earl Haig, received an earldom and $500,000 in cash; Earl Beatty, admiral of the fleet, also received $500,000; and Earl Jellicoe, in command at the battle of Jutland, received $250,000. Not bad!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The British fleet still serves a useful purpose in the Empire, and when danger seems to threaten, as during the Italo-Ethiopian unpleasantness, the “Mistress of the Seas” is not slow to take action. At that time the government summoned pensioners to return to the navy for three years, promising them they should continue to receive their pensions in addition to getting the standard rate of pay for the service performed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Also, for the first time since 1914 Britain called the Naval Reserve, and when the British fleet was engaged in maneuvers off Malta they exploded a few depth bombs, among other exercises, and, so says the account, Italian submarines came popping up like corks. Just a bit of repartee between empires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Angry because the young men of Britain are unresponsive to the British government's urgent cry for more soldiers, the munition makers are pushing hard to popularize Fascism. But a little while ago who would have supposed that such a man as Sir Oswald Mosley could fill London’s largest auditorium, Royal Albert Hall, and hold his audience one and three-fourths hours white he poured forth the foolish stuff that has driven Germany and Italy mad and is bent upon conquering the world for the Roman Catholic Hierarchy? Edward VIII sent a telegram to Hitler congratulating him on his birthday. Next year, when Edward VIII is crowned, each peer will swear to him “life and limb and earthly worship”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">British papers contain strange stories of men justifying an attack upon a woman because she did not stand up when the orchestra played “God Save the King&quot;; of the rush to make 30,000,000 gas masks for adults and 3,000,000 for infants, and at the same time of the sabotage of seven warships within a few weeks one of another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">William Philip Simms, publicist, says that in twenty-live years he has never seen so crazy a situation as that now confronting Britain, and George Lansbury, M.P., says of peace-loving men and women that &quot;they act as if some unseen power were driving them on—a power which mankind cannot overcome”. “ ’Tis true, ’tis pity, and pity ’tis ’tis true.” Gog, the prime minister of the Devil, is the evil force driving mankind toward Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The munition makers are always boasting of their new devices for slaughtering peace-loving men, and then making a great to-do later about decorating the soldiers or their graves with military insignia or wreaths or crosses as the case may be. As these murderers work in fullest accord with the military oflicials everywhere, the cartoonist thinks new shells should be attached to the soldiers in the manner shown below, so that on arrival at his destination he could promptly claim his empty reward while the militarists, lords and ladies clap their hands in glee at the new invention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued in next issue)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Cincinnati papers contain pictures of artillery trucks of which sixteen are to be delivered to the Roman Catholic Xavier University, by Oct. 23, 1936.

<h3><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>Will It Happen Here?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font21">T</span><span class="font11">HE confiding and unsuspecting citizens who believe that a dictatorship just can’t happen in this country are in for the shock of their lives some day in the sweet by and by, if the plans of the militarists, munition makers and other disciples of Cain are carried out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Until recently there was tucked away in the archives of the War Department a complete set of secret plans for the establishment of the iron rule in this country. It was designed that these plans should rest quietly in their cubby holes until the proper time arrived. A war or threat of war would be the signal to put them in operation. Then they would be brought forth, rushed through Congress as emergency measures, and John Citizen would suddenly find himself all sewed up in the army.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">While engaged in the interesting task of bringing to light the unholy activities of the munition makers Senator Bennett Clark discovered these hidden plans, and dragged them out in the open for all to see and observe. Possibly by that act Senator Clark has saved his country from being Hitlerized and Mussolini-ized in very disgraceful fashion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Let us assume, Mr. John Citizen, that you are a male person of the age of eighteen years or upward and that war has been declared between the United States and some other nation. The War Department plans are put in operation. What is your place in the picture ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is all laid out for you. First, you are suddenly inducted into the army. No need to volunteer. The whole male population by law comes under military control. You may be told to go with the doughboys as machine-gun nutriment. Or you may be told to labor in the factory, or on the farm, or in a ditch. You will not have anything to say about your wages, place of labor, or condition of servitude. These will be arranged for you by the kind-hearted military.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And remember, John, that it will not do any good to kick. Your wages may be next door to nothing, but a strike by you and your fellow laborers w’ill not be healthy. You might receive different jobs, but they would probably be out on the front line where cannon ball and shrapnel make hideous noises, and there is no good place to sleep. Or you and your family may be shut off without food, and left to expire without the aid of a physician.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If you are in business when all this happens, you may wake up some morning and find a gentleman in uniform taking over your plant. You will be told that you can take a vacation— 'going over the top’, or indulging in some other open-air activity. Will you be paid for your business? Probably, yes; but somebody else will determine the price. The president in this most gracious scheme will have authority to take over any business or property and pay for it as he sees fit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Or if you continue in business you will be saved much worry and figuring. You will be told what to pay for goods; at what price to sell; what to pay for help; and how much help you may have. If you are printing a newspaper or a magazine you might just as well shut off the juice and shoot the editor, for your opportunities to print facts and express opinions will have been put into a complete state of innocuous desuetude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">You may decide to assert your constitutional rights before a court, but you will be informed that the constitution isn’t working these days; that you are in the army now and subject to the army laws, and that you might just as well take it and like it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">So then your hope will be for the war to end. The war may end. The shot and shell will stop screaming. Murder on mass scale will cease, but you ■will find yourself still under the dictatorship. Although the battles have ceased, the president will have the authority to determine when the emergency ends; and, until he so proclaims, the dictatorship will continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Do you suppose, John, that any dictator is going to release his control of a hundred million people just because a little matter of shooting bullets and stabbing humans has ceased? Dictators aren’t built that way, and plenty of good reasons will be found to continue the broad- and tender-hearted arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">These plans for dictatorship are all in print in the form of proposed legislation before Congress. They call for complete control of the actions, the lives, and the very thoughts of the people. A war emergency is all that is needed to put on a dictatorship in these United States that will make Hitler look like a piker. Day by day in every way the dictatorships get bigger and more powerful, and when the Roman Catholic Hierarchy gets its claws on this country by means of a military dictatorship only the power of Almighty God through His kingdom will bring freedom to the people.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>Will the Roman Catholic Hierarchy Dehate?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font21">T</span><span class="font11">HE effort being made by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to silence Judge Rutherford and to prevent the further broadcasting of Biblical discussions is characteristic of that organization. It is of interest, however, that many Catholics have imbibed of the true spirit of freedom to such an extent that they do not endorse or support the activities of the Hierarchy in this connection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On the other hand, the petition being circulated that this matter be discussed in an open and aboveboard manner is characteristic of the true American tradition, and also in harmony with the Scriptures. When God condescends to reason with those who are out of the way, are those professing to be His representatives to resent any attempt on the part of others to ascertain the bases of their claims? If the Hierarchy is indeed the agency of God for the government of the world, will they refuse to bring forth their “strong causes” and give their proofs of such assignment?</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19360812_files/g_E_19360812-8.png" alt="" style="width:233pt;height:273pt;">
<p><span class="font9">“Kin ye fayture It, Kathy? Oi was ilivated to the office of glirand Hierarchical cinsor down at the Vatican lodge, this no i ght.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;Aye, Dennis, an’ 'tis a foine toime fer ye t’ be blatherin’ o' lodge promotions, whin our little bairne is dyin’ av petitionitis.”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">Yes, Judge Rutherford has questioned the right of the Hierarchy to teach “in the name of God” certain doctrines which millions reject as being out of harmony with the Scriptures. But he is willing to debate the proposition, fairly and openly, and give the Hierarchy an opportunity to justify its statements that Judge Rutherford misrepresents their teachings. Millions will sign the petition asking that the matter be debated and discussed in the open. But, will the Hierarchy debate?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There are those who insist that the Hierarchy or its agents will never reason with those who disagree with them. They will silence them as soon as possible. Not only that, any reference to the Catholic Hierarchy and its methods, unless it is laudatory and obsequious, is resented by the Hierarchy. Is not the day past when any institution in the earth can assume a sacrosanct attitude ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Will the Hierarchy debate? Certainly it should be willing to accept so fair a challenge, so considerate an offer. But the Hierarchy has not itself followed such a liberal and generous course. When WBBR, in Brooklyn, N. Y., for instance, made some statements by radio which, while entirely true, were not altogether complimentary of the methods of the Hierarchy, that institution, through the magazine of the International Catholic Truth Society, called </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font11"> in the May (1936) number, wrote the following </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">mild rebuke:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What can be done about it? Station WBBR is not a commercial station. Therefore it has no advertisers to boycott. It has, however, a Federal license which should be revoked and, perhaps, a New York State corporate charter which should be dissolved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">That is the policy being pursued against Station WBBR in Brooklyn, and that is the policy which all Catholics should pursue against any radio station whose programs are characterized by religious intolerance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Could anything be more outrageously arrogant and intolerant than this proposition to wipe out WBBR and also to dissolve its corporate charter ? And this, according to the article in which the highhanded action is recommended, because station WBBR broadcast </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">three news items</span><span class="font11"> which the Hierarchy disapproved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In America the Congress is not above criticism. Nor is the president himself exempted from having his acts discussed adversely in any newspaper that may differ with him. His office does not place his actions above the judgment of the people whom he serves. But the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, as the remnant of an obsolete past, still insists that the priestly tribe can do no wrong, though everybody knows very well to the contrary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But the Hierarchy attaches insist that WBBR must be silenced, and rendered </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">hors de combat </span><span class="font11">completely; for has it not presumed to mention the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in other than laudatory terms? That is enough for the Hierarchy. WBBR, as far as it is concerned, is condemned to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Here is a beautiful condition of affairs. The Catholic Hierarchy exists in the United States because of the general freedom conceded to be the right of all to practice what they please in the way of “divine service” even though such “service” may be only the dusty remnants of idol worship. The responsibility is placed upon the individual for his own acts. And now, in the name of “religious freedom” the Hierarchy seeks to throttle an organization and ban it from the air waves because it happens to disagree with the Hierarchy. By the same token the Hierarchy should be banned from the air waves and all its institutions dissolved, because of the invidious criticism it has leveled against those who are not Catholic Hierarchy subjects. But, not to digress:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Will the Hierarchy debate? It remains to be seen. Americans can do no other than give this institution every opportunity to do the fair thing or to manifest its utter indifference to what is just and equal. The Petition continues to increase in size. The Federal Communications Commission, and radio stations of the United States that have been covertly and secretly approached by the Hierarchy’s agents, will be openly approached by fair-minded and liberty-loving Americans (including many of the Catholic population) with the request that this matter be brought into the open and the issue fairly considered.</span></p>

<p><span class="font21">C</span><span class="font11">ATHOLICS vociferously deny that “papa” forbids them to read the Bible. Probably in the United States the old “whore” can’t get away with it, but down in Latin-American Colombia the situation is different. I was well acquainted with Senor Don Heliodoro de Zapata y Ochoa, a distinguished cavalier from Medellin, Colombia, and a faithful “son” of the so-called “church”. One night, completely nonplussed at his collosal ignorance of a certain Biblical subject, I asked, “Heliodoro, did you ever read the Bible ?” “The Bible!” he replied in horror. “Of course not. In my country the Bible is a prohibited book.” Now, this speech came, not from one of the 90 percent of Colombia’s illiterate population, but from the son of one of the governors of a state, a man who had had two years in medicine and who was sent to Detroit as commercial consul for the Colombian government. This just shows how far these toe-kissers can go when they have the right kind of material to work with.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">A five-minute talk</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">J</span><span class="font11">USTICE is the foundation of Jehovah’s throne. It is impossible for Him to be unjust. It is -written, at Psalm 19: ‘The law of Jehovah is perfect, and the testimony of God is sure, making wise the simple.’ Justice, the perfect law of God, and His testimony, operate harmoniously together. The law of God provides that salvation is available to all who believe and obey the Lord Jesus Christ. The law of God judges no man without a hearing. These provisions make it certain that man must have an opportunity to know and to believe the truth to the end that each one may choose to serve God and live or to remain under Satan’s influence and die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It follows therefore that someone must bring to the attention of the people God’s testimony of truth, that those who will give heed to that truth may be made wise. Jehovah has made provision for that very thing. For many years the question before the minds of creatures has been, Who is supreme, and to whom should I render myself in obedience? Each one must understand the truth in order to properly answer this question. Men who faithfully obey God have a part in the vindication of His name. God sent Jesus Christ to the earth for the primary purpose of giving testimony to the truth, that those who would hear might choose to walk in the right way and live. Concerning His earthly commission Jesus said: ‘To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth; and every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.’ That means that the only way to obtain the truth is to hear and give heed to what Jesus taught, and which truth He received from Jehovah. Jesus selected and sent forth His apostles for the primary purpose of giving testimony to the truth. They were never commissioned to convert the world, but to tell others concerning Jehovah’s purpose that men might determine whom they would serve. Everyone who has been a faithful witness to the truth has been violently opposed and persecuted by the Devil and his agents, for the reason that the Devil is the father of lies and attempts to keep the people in ignorance of God’s truth. It was because</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jesus gave testimony to the truth that He was persecuted to death. It was because His apostles went about the country from house to house telling the truth that they were arrested, beaten and thrown into prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Shortly after the death of the apostles selfish men, under the guidance of the Devil, built up religious organizations and named these “Christian organizations”, and ever since then such organizations or religious institutions have operated and have persecuted those who tell the truth about God’s Word. The oldest of such religious organizations for years prosecuted the wicked Inquisition, which brought so much suffering upon honest people. All those who bore testimony to the truth were cruelly punished by that religious institution; and that of itself is the best evidence that such religious organization is of the Devil. Now we have come to the end of Satan’s world and God is sending out His witnesses to bear testimony to the truth, to wit, that Jehovah is the only true God, that Christ Jesus is King, and His kingdom is the only hope of the world, and that the Kingdom is now at hand. The persons who are going about, as the apostles did, bearing testimony to the truth are cruelly persecuted by that same religious institution that carried on the Inquisition. Jehovah’s witnesses are persecuted, not because they are doing injury to anyone, but because they are telling the truth which exposes Satan's wicked organization by which the people have been deceived and misled, and which truth informs the people that God’s kingdom is at hand. That same religious organization attempts to get control of all the political offices of the land in order to compel the people to be submissive to the selfish men that rule the organization. All honest people, regardless of what organization they have heretofore associated with, will be anxious to know what is the truth, that they may do the right thing. Such persons are designated in the Scriptures as persons of good will, and God sends to them' His witnesses to tell them the truth as set forth in the Bible. Take notice now that Jehovah’s witnesses are being persecuted in various parts of the earth by the leaders of the religious organization that long ago set up the Spanish Inquisition. As stated by the Lord, those who are wise amongst men will hear and give heed to the testimony of God's Word. They will become wise because they will intelligently choose to walk in the -way that God has provided, which leads to everlasting life in happiness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">1936 Queens County. Now called Leix</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">February 17. Interviewed by two men representing the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, who commanded me to leave town immediately. I refused, after showing them their responsibility to Jehovah. They then threaten Roman Catholic landlady, to burn her house if she did not get rid of me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">February 18. Businessmen organizing mob to burn literature and put me on the boat train for England. To save literature call a taxi and take all my belongings to another place. Ten p.m. police chief with seven others enter my bedroom with flash lamps. Some question me while others search around me in bed for firearms. They examine the literature, luggage and correspondence, continually plying me with questions. I gave a witness. Soon they realized a mistake had been made. Left in subdued frame of mind. One comical incident. They found a sports gun hanging on the wall, over which hung a text card with the scripture, “Thou art my help and my deliverer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">February 23. Have a share in the great hookup. Visit England for that purpose, after leaving literature in police station in charge of friendly sergeant. While in England four armed men enter lodgings in Ireland and ask for me, as they want to take me into the woods and shoot me. Then they ask for literature to burn it. They find neither.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kings County. Now called Offaly</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">March 7. Put out of lodgings by family, who were afraid their house would be burned down again. The mob had done it once. Opposition aroused and police hostile; so off to another town on the map.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">County Tipperary</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">March 8. Arrive R----, 9 a.m. Get a room,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">dump cartons and luggage therein; witness all day with good results. Alarm amongst the dominies, who warn flock at evening service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">March 9. Warning emphasized. Roman Catholic landlady kindly disposed, but afraid. Am asked to go. My search for another room, even amongst Protestants, unsuccessful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">March 10. Arrive at N----, after throwing</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“blood-hounds” off scent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">March 26. Witnessing in a village. Priest arrives. Accuses me to police of selling dirty literature. He threatens to stir up the whole district against me. I accuse him to police as a lawbreaker. Fireworks from priest, which makes police disgusted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">March 29. Receive deputation of three men, who insist that I leave town immediately. I refuse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">March 30. Two policemen visit me. Examine literature. Find no fault.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">March 31. Renewed visit of police, who say the whole town is in an uproar. Examine literature again. Again find no fault. More questions. They desire to know when I leave. I can’t answer that one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">April 1. Fool’s day. Meeting of the town council.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">April 2. Morning. Deputation from the town council visit landlady and tell her to put me out. I visit police chief, who shows his bigotry and insults me. In spite of priests, police and town council I continue to witness. Stopped by mob, who forcibly take me to my lodge, steal my literature and burn it. Later leave for Dublin under police protection (?), crowds filling the streets, some booing, shouting. I smilingly raise my hat to them, knowing that many may think and take their stand for Jehovah shortly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">April 4. Thankful for the privilege of commencing the special week “His Strange Work” campaign in the capital of the Irish Free State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The foregoing is a sample of the difficulties to be met with, but, as elsewhere, there are many hearts hungering for the Truth, and, although surrounded by enemies, the knowledge of God’s kingdom is reaching them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">D</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ES? in the heart of the textile South, in La Grange, Georgia, 171 men and women have come to discover that the religious freedom their ancestors sought in America no longer exists here. Attempting to spread their doctrine, they met up with that most sinister force—Georgia law </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">as </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">these men and women, all natives of Alabama and Georgia, can tell you, the term “law” has a peculiar significance in the South. One of its chief functions is to deprive citizens of their birthright and to ignore privileges granted by the Constitution of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">On May 15. a hundred and seventy-one members of a religious group known as Jehovah's Witnesses were gathered into custody in La Grange. They were charged with peddling without a license. The law used to convict them is one not usually enforced. The Witnesses, who include among their numbers professional people as welt as farmers and mill workers, justly claimed they were not peddling anything. They were distributing, free of charge, their literature among the residents of La Grange.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">La Grange is a town of 25.000 inhabitants In Southern textile communities jails play a prominent role. The mill owners know jails as instruments of oppression and keep them well filled The La Grange jail, however, was not built with an eye to mass arrests The Jehovah Witnesses were therefore committed four miles out of town to the Troup County Stockade, otherwise known as the Bull Pen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Troup County Bull Pen is a corral for chain gang prisoners. In the middle </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> an iron fenced enclosure is a small building where prisoners who “get there</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">first" may sleep under cover When the Jehovah Witnesses reached the stockade, they found they were all extras. They were told to put their faith In Jehovah and see if he would warm them with the soft lights from the stars. They were denied blankets for the first five nights. Later, fifty-two blankets were distributed among them, that they might take turns trying to keep warm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Of the 171 arrested persons, approximately 100 were women. The authorities of La Grange are proud of their tolerance in not driving the women into the Bull Pen with the men</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Some of them were mothers,&quot; a policeman explained “We just locked them up in the YMCA. Then we let them sign their own bonds and go home. All except a nigger woman who was one of them. She’s back tn there.&quot; He nodded his head toward the interior of the jail. Then he grinned. “We got her cooking for her holy men folks.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HEN I went into La Grange the men had been taken from the soft ground of the Bull Pen and put to work on the road At night they were locked up in the Recorder’s Court at La Grange.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The police sergeant with whom I talked looked suspiciously at my credentials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“You ain't mtxed up with them folks. I hope,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I told him </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> was Just Interested in the case He opened up then and gave me his land the mill owners ) point of view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“First off, I want you to understand this ain’t no case of religious persecution,” he told me. We ain’t got no law that bothers people for that This is a pure and simple case “of violation of a law that takes care of peddlers. And what they was peddling’ Why It's regular overthrow the government stuff.” He pulled out one of the pamphlets that police had confiscated. “Just look at that. If that isn't Communistic, then I don't know what Communistic stuff is!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I glanced through the booklet. It was the printed record of a radio speech made by the national leader of the Jehovah Witnesses, Judge J. F. Rutherford The printed pages were heavily Interspersed with Biblical references The policeman watched me closely as I read</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Just notice that stuff about the Flag.” he said. &quot;They don’t believe in saluting the Flag! They say it's ell right not to Salute it. It It's enough to make your blood boil&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I read the paragraph he indicated. It referred to the arrest of a little boy who refused to salute the Flag and to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sing </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“America ” In defense of the child, Judge Rutherford maintained that to compel a citizen or the child of a citizen to salute any object or thing a as unfair and wrong</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The policeman was duly excited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“It's pure Communism,&quot; he kept saying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I asked him if the defendants seemed to be intelligent people. He frowned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Oh. they’re smart appearing, all right,” he admitted Look just like anyone else. But theyie m here to prey on the ignorance of our mill people, and we ain’t going to stand for that. You take some of these ignorant young boys and girls out there in the nulls, for instance, and they're liable to fall for this stuff. We got to protect our people. They don’t know a jack shit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I suggested that perhaps the Jehovah Witness people were sincere. He nodded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Oh. they’re sincere enough,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I felt like reminding him he had just said it was a racket. &quot;Ain’t a one of them but Insisted they'd take a jad sentence rather than say they was guilty</span></p>

WriL they can just sweat It out there on the road. That out to take the heat Out oC them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I questioned him then about the Negroes who were members </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> the group. He swung around in his swivel chair, frowning hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;That's what makes yotureally sick to your stomach,” he said. &quot;Them two that’s niggers, hell, they treat them Just hie they was white. Two of the ones that got out on bond keep coming back here to see the niggers. They go into their cells and shake them by the band smd call them Brother and Slater. And they bring them things to eat. It's enough to turn your stomach '*</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">L</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ATER in the day I wandered out to the Bull Pen. It’s a lonely looking establishment, far away from any houses. The building Itself Is dull gray. There were only a few guards in the yard when I got there The men had not yet come in from the chain gang. A tall man in prison overalls, a trustee, walked over to the gate and talked with me. He showed<sup>1</sup> interest when he learned I had come to find out about the Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;It was pure dirty, the way they got treated,” he volunteered. &quot;All of them was sleeping here on the ground. Ain't none of them had a blanket for five nights. Just lucky it didn’t rain ” His eyes narrowed a bit. &quot;I ain’t ought to be talking none, I guess,” he went on, with a glance toward the front of the building, where guards were sitting in chairs tilted back, &quot;but them was a sura enough fine and honest bunch of people. And some of the stuff they talked was aense&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The trustee was in for two years on an embezzlement charge. He </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">told</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> me his name I said I would not use it in my </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">story, but he shook his head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;I ain’t telling you not to&quot; he said. &quot;Them people got a rotten deal'and they was sensible decent folk. They impressed me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">From the Bull Pen I went by the road on which the gang of Jehovah Witnesses had been put to work There were guards, but the men stopped their work and</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">JEHOVAH’S</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">talked with me for a moment. They were all dressed alike, in prison overalls—a widely assorted group of men. I asked one youngster how old he was and he said thirteen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Fellow over there la S3,” he told me</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">X looked at the direction to which he pointed. An old man with a hoe looked up and smiled. He was little and bent and'his long beard caressed the handle of the hoe. The day was heavy and warm. Perspiration stood out on all of their faces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Back in La Grange I talked with a number of people about the Witnesses. The business men spoke bitterly. A big fellow with a wide waistline talked rather fully. He asked me if I were from the GEORGIAN, then didn’t wait for an answer. The GEORGIAN is Hearst's Atlanta paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Nothing but damn Bolsheviks,” he said </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> the prisoners. &quot;They swarmed in here atrying to take </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">La</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Grange. Well, hell, we ain’t going to let their like get no foothold here. They say it’s a religion they preach. Now. I’m all for religion. It keeps things going smooth. But this stuff—why, they even take in niggers. And they don’t recognize no man-made law. Well, that d^n’t go nere, no matter how law-abiding they try to act.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> REMINDED him they maintained they had broken no law. His heavy lipped mouth set in an angry expression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Well, we ain’t going to tolerate them here noway. They can believe and act like god-fearing, law-abiding </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">folk</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> according to our figures or get out. If they try to come back here some more, we </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">got </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">other ways of dealing with them I was all with some of the other people in this here town who said right from the first that the way to handle them was to take the leaders </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> a ’fish fry* and run the others out on a rad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He evidently gathered that I did not know what a fish fry was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Into the river with weights&quot; he explained</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">This man voiced the sentiment of the mill magnates of La Grange. Fifteen thousand of the town’s population are* mill working families. Caxton Calloway, who owns the largest number of textile mills in La Grange, is said to subsidize a number </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> preachers in the town. Two girls, the Newberry sisters, were fired from the Calloway Hillside Mill when it was learned they were members of Jehovah’s Witnesses. They and their </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">family </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">were evicted from the company house in which they lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Populous as they seem even today the La Grange mill villages are empty </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">many workers since the General Textile Strike in 1934. A heavy blacklist sent thousands of workers wandering their weary way through the South, looking for work at mills already posted to turn them away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The working class children of this mill town roam barefoot through the streets, their bent-boned small bodies topped by curiously old little faces. They have a knowledge of real hunger already, and they know the horror of pellagra.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">* On one shabby street I passed a little boy who was crying. I asked him what was the matter. He answered tearfully that his daddy said they’d have to kill his pet rabbit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;My rabbit ain't for killing,’’ he protested. &quot;But daddy says that don't matter, we got to get meat some way.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He looked afraid then, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">m</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1/ he had said too much, and ran back from the street to me </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">side of the grey</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> double where he lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">B</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ACK In Atlanta, I went to the headquarters of the local company of Jehovah’s Witnesses. I told the woman in charge that X had heard the Witnesses were oelng persecuted </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">m </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Communists. 8he said very little, but gave me some of their literature to read. Like the pamphlets I had seen in the La Grange police station, all of the Jehovah works were Biblical. They preach a doc trine of Bible Interpretation. The sect believes </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In passive acceptance</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> of persecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;But you'll fight against these arrests, won’t you?&quot; I asked her. She nodded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Oh yes. We don’t break any laws, and it Isn’t right they should try to say we did.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Jehovah Witnesses are strongly opposed to war and they oppose the organized clergy whom they maintain have designated themselves officials in order to advance In the world of — to become professional politicians and commercial giants. Their main riaim against the existing ecclesiastical systems i« that &quot;they have advocated and sanctified war, acting as recruiting officers for pay, and preached men into the trenches, there to suffer and die.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Likewise, the Witnesses strongly oppose Fascism. Their current works are fitted with anti-Hitler drawings and editorials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Jehovah Witnesses are also known as Ruscehtes and Rutherfordites. Charles Taze. Russell founded the group during the latter part of the 19th Century. He and his followers have published innumerable books, printed in many languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Judge J. F. Rutherford became the leader when Russell died. The Rutherfordites do not believe in keeping statistics^ They say they are not interested in knowing how many people their ranks number. They believe in equality. Tiicj say God doesn’t mean for them to judfcc a man by the color of his skin. Nevertheless, in Georgia, they observe the law that forbids Negroes and whites to enter a house by the same entrance. Their Negro members meet separately. The leaders of Jehovah's Witnesses in Atlanta regret this. They are anxious above all, they say, to &quot;avoid trouble”—so they compromise on this </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> asked If this meant they did not believe in full equality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The woman with whom I talked answered no. All human beings are the same, she said, and the Witnesses it cognize no differences of color</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">As the case now stands, the La Giange defendants must serve 30 da&gt;s on the road. Later, it is possible the State of Georgia itself will piosecute them. There is a State law reading as the city ordinance of La Grange does—and the mill owners are eager to destroy the Witnesses and their Influence among the mill workers. Whether or not the mill owners really believe this doctrine •’Communistic&quot; Is doubtful. The fact that they.believe io equality and hate war is sufficient to indict the Witnesses in the South. The mill owners do not want the Bible Interpreted in any manner bul their own submissive acceptance of long hours and starvation wages, hunger and disease and the stretchout.</span></p>

How is it that the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Worker </span><span class="font10">can send a woman and get an exact statement of an important and infamous conspiracy against innocent American citizens, and the president of the United States, with billions at his command, and his boasted force of G-men and sleuths, cannot find out anything ? Is he interested only in the Roman Hierarchy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On page 726, from the front page of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Monitor, </span><span class="font10">Aurora, Mo., edited by Charles Murphy, is an equally truthful and accurate account of what happened at Monessen, Pa. The president cannot say this was not brought to his attention. (The Lagrange conspiracy was, also.) The Roman Catholic dictator at Monessen deprived Jehovah’s witnesses of their school because, at the outset, there was one toilet for 19 pupils, but, being a tool of the Roman Hierarchy, he did not at all mind forcing 146 of Jehovah’s witnesses, men, women and children, into cells where they were packed almost like sardines in a tin. Would he have subjected Roman Catholic priests and Roman Catholic nuns and “orphans” to conditions like this?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mr. Roosevelt knows that he would not. And if he </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">had</span><span class="font10"> done it, Mr. Roosevelt would have found some way to give it adequate attention in this year of our Lord 1936, when he wants the 8,000,000 votes they can command.</span></p>

They sprang out from all directions as if Satan had warned them of our coming with the Kingdom message. They followed us from house to house until we called at the last one in their district, and, calling us everything they could think of, they sneered and jeered and hollered, sounding the alarm at every house, telling the people to use hot water on us or to get their guns and shoot us, etc., etc. However, this did not deter any of us from keeping right on with the Lord's work, calling at every house in that vicinity and presenting our testimony cards under much difficulty without getting much chance to talk to anyone, owing to the interference of the gang, and mostly all identifying themselves on the enemy’s side. It was a strenuous day for us, walking over twenty miles and working under such conditions.

<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark139"></a>Murderers and Their Finish</span></h3>
<p><span class="font21">G</span><span class="font11">OD is Love. The Devil is “a murderer from the beginning’ of his career as God’s opponent. His very first overt act in the furtherance of his rebellious scheme exposed to death not only the first human pair, but also all their offspring. Utterly conscienceless, Satan has since built up a mighty organization, composed of murderers, robbers and blasphemers.—1 John 4:8; John 8:44; Genesis 3:4; 1 John 5:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">God’s commandment directs men to love others as themselves. (Matthew 22: 39) Those who are of Satan’s organization hate one another. There is “no love lost’’ between them. “Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer,” and is “as Cain, who was of that wicked one [Satan], and slew his brother”. (1 John 3:12-15) Jehovah’s law commands, “Thou shalt do no murder.”—Matthew 19:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Not all who are subject to Satan’s organization are in sympathy with it, but are kept in ignorance of its real nature. Satan has given his organization a religious gloss, and in countries where the gospel has had a measure of circulation he has even adopted Biblical and Christian names or terms to cloak his activities. The formalistic religious practices in so-called “Christian” nations, though differing little in form, and nothing in reality, from those of unenlightened nations, are linked with Scriptural incidents in such a manner as to best serve the purpose of the deceivers.—Matthew 15:9; 2 Timothy 3: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Religious practices are calculated to accomplish selfish and unholy ends and are utilized to frustrate the efforts of the people to seek and practice righteousness. The repetition of “prayers”, so called, is prescribed as “penance” for wrongdoing, and the performing of endless empty ceremonies “atones” for crookedness, unrighteousness and sin.—Matthew 15:1-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The professed Christian church is well described in the words of Isaiah, “How is the faithful [church] become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.” (Isaiah 1:21) Similarly Jeremiah describes the condition of unfaithful Christianity, picturing it by Jerusalem. “I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child; the voice of the daughter of Zion, that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.” (Jeremiah 4:31) This is the condition of those who love righteousness but who have been to a greater or less degree entangled in the doings of “Christendom”. Such ‘sigh and cry for the abominations that be done therein’. —Ezekiel 9: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Only dimly as yet are many of the people of good will aware of the extent of the murderous activities of so-called &quot;Christendom”. The deeds are generally not perpetrated in the open, but covertly. The Scriptures state of the wicked, “Tn the secret places doth he murder the innocent.” (Psalm 10:8) And, further, “The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.” (Job 24:14) “They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.” (Psalm 94: 6) Religious leaders are definitely implicated, and of the whole crew are the most reprehensible, because of their assumed piety. “Priests murder in the way by consent.”—Hosea 6: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There are many, particularly in “Christendom”, who have supported the murderous and wicked system of oppression, having been identified with commercial, religious and political activities that have sanctified war, thus making them party to the breaking of God's everlasting covenant. (Genesis 9:5,6) Others have participated in the persecution of God’s people, not realizing that they were violating God’s law, but doing so ignorantly and because of the misrepresentations of the religious leaders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Just as the religious leaders, working with the political rulers, accomplished the murder of the Lord Jesus Christ, and involved the nation of Israel in the guilt thereof; so now the religious leaders have been instrumental in the death of many of God’s people and in the persecution of others and still continue their wicked work. They likewise deceive others and involve them in these acts.—Acts 7:52; James 5:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As all of Israel was involved in the murder of Jesus, so all “Christendom” is involved in blood-guiltiness because of the persecution of God’s people, while the whole earth is guilty of the wanton and unrighteous shedding of human blood.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark140"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark141"></a>Retribution</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">To the Israelites Jesus said, shortly before His death: “Ye are the children of them which killed the prophets. Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers. Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city: that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar. Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.” (Matthew 23:31, 32, 34-36) The predicted punishment came upon the people as predicted, but some of the Israelites were spared because they grasped the opportunity to “save [themselves] from this untoward generation”.—Acts 2: 40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Among the Jews and also in “Christendom” there have been those who have no sympathy with the murderous works of the wicked, yet have been forced or deceived into supporting these works and are therefore, though unwittingly, guilty of shedding blood. They, too, are now called upon to save themselves from the present untoward and disobedient generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There is a way of escape. Those who take this way of escape will be spared in the retribution which is about to come upon the world, and particularly upon “Christendom”. The way of escape is pictured by the “cities of refuge” which were appointed in Israel for the protection of the unwitting manslayer. There were six of these cities. (Deuteronomy 4:41-44; Joshua 20:7-9) They were a place of refuge “for the children of Israel”, “for the stranger” and “for the sojourner”. In the fulfillment of the prophetic picture there would be a refuge for those in “Christendom”, and also for those associated with “Christendom” but not a part of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The cities of refuge were not for the willful or intentional murderer. One who killed another with a weapon, instrument of iron, club or missile purposely used was put to death. (Numbers 35:16-18) The murderer's blood was shed by the avenger or revenger. (Number 35:19) Only if the killing of an individual was accidental or unpremeditated could the slayer flee to the cities of refuge and find protection.—Numbers 35:12.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark142"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark143"></a>The Avenger</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">The execution of vengeance devolved upon one by reason of kinship. Jesus is the great “kinsman” of the human race. He is God’s official executioner. “For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son; and hath given him authority to execute judgment also, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">because he is the Son of man.” </span><span class="font11">(John 5:22,27; Deuteronomy 19:21) God’s provision in the cities of refuge foreshadowed greater things to come to pass in the near future.—Hebrews 10:1; 12: 22-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The gross and flagrant violation of the everlasting covenant by the shedding of human blood must now be avenged, because the day of God’s vengeance is here. (Isaiah 61:1, 2) Satan knows that soon the battle of the great day of God Almighty will be fought. (Revelation 12:12) Justice will be meted out to the murderers, and Jehovah’s name will be vindicated. It will be seen that He has not authorized or condoned the wanton shedding of human blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Satan’s organization of wickedness is called Babylon, which is pictured as an unchaste and wicked woman. (Revelation 17:1-6,18) It is the great super-organization of wickedness that controls the course of all the nations and religious systems of the world, and particularly those of “Christendom”, where God's people have lived, given their witness, been persecuted and slain. (See verse 6.) Those who have been unwittingly associated with this wicked system have been in a greater or less degree involved in its bloodguilt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Such, if they would escape, must hasten to the city of refuge. “Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul; be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the Lord's vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence.” (Jeremiah 51:6) “Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. . . . Come out of her, my people, that ye be not [willing] partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.”—Revelation 18:2,4,5; </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Light, </span><span class="font11">Book Two, page 115.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For thousands of years Satan and his wicked organization have dominated the course of the world. Both Satan, his angels, and those who have taken their stand on Satan’s side, by following his-ways, shall be destroyed at Armageddon by Jehovah’s executioner Christ Jesus. He has “come to his temple” for judgment. (Malachi 3:1-5; Matthew 24: 3-16) He calls upon the nations and their rulers to give heed. (Psalm 11:4; Habakkuk 2:20) Notice is given to the official element of Satan’s visible organization that it will be destroyed, but they continue to persecute and oppress the Lord’s people. They conspire to destroy God’s servants. (Psalm 83:1-5) Thus they manifest their malice and cruel hatred.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark144"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark145"></a>No Mercy for the Wicked</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">Those who killed another through hatred or malice were slain by the avenger. Similarly the plotters of Satan's organization, including the malicious clergy and their commercial and political allies, will suffer execution at the hands of Christ. Just as the executioners in Ezekiel’s vision destroyed without mercy those who had defamed God's name and all associated with them, so likewise the persecutors of God’s faithful people and the wanton bloodshedders will be destroyed without mercy.—Ezekiel 9: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Throughout “Christendom”, so called, there are millions of good and honest persons who would not willingly be involved or implicated in the shedding of innocent blood. They have, however, been drawn into Satan’s trap without realizing it and have been caused to commit injustice against others. Ignorance of God’s law in a measure excuses one, provided that one turns to righteousness when he becomes aware of his wrong course. They must not safeguard the guilty ones, but must, like the ‘elders of [the manslayer’s] city’, deliver up the guilty, and not hesitate to ‘deliver up the heads of the sons of Ahab’ to the executioner. (2 Kings 10:1-7) They do not take part in the execution of any individual, but declare the truth regarding God’s purpose to destroy the wicked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Many of those who participated in and supported the World War did so because they were compelled to do so by those who claimed to be “the higher powers”. The war manifested the hypocrisy and the duplicity of the clergy who had viciously urged upon others the killing of human creatures. Honest men were shocked by the conduct of the religious leaders, and such of them as had had part in the war had a desire to know and to do the will of God. Others have supported the oppressors of the people and the persecutors of Jehovah’s witnesses, doing so ignorantly, like Saul of Tarsus. (Acts 8:1-3; 9:1-22) Still others, as members of the police force, reluctantly committed acts of injustice and violence against God’s people. Those, however, who honestly change their course of action and seek meekness and righteousness may find safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">God’s organization is the antitype of the cities of refuge. Jehovah has made provision for all who have violated His everlasting covenant unwittingly or “at unawares”. Those in “Christendom” and who form no part of it but are of good will may find a haven of refuge in the city (organization) that is wholly devoted to Jehovah and His service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The cities of refuge were occupied by those of the tribe of Levi. It was the duty of the Levites in the cities of refuge to give information, aid and comfort to those seeking refuge. Similarly it is the duty of the servants and witnesses of Jehovah to carry to the people of good will the message of the Kingdom, informing them of God’s provision for those who honestly and earnestly seek to know Him and do His will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Ezekiel pictures the priestly or Levitical class going through the city (representing “Christendom”), placing a mark [Hebrew: </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">tav\</span><span class="font11"> upon the foreheads of those who are not in sympathy with the un-Christian course of “Christendom” and who desire to know the truth about God and His organization. It is those who are thus marked and who flee from the unrighteous organization to the righteous organization that are spared and come out of (away from) the great tribulation.—Ezekiel 9: G; Zephaniah 2:3; Revelation 7:14; Isaiah 49: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The great multitude of those who have in a greater or less degree, though unwittingly, supported the murderous organization of “Christendom” are in danger of being slain, and Jehovah’s witnesses, as Levitical ministers, must inform them of their danger and urge them to flee to God’s city of refuge. Failure to do so would be unfaithfulness on their part. “If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be slain; if thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it ? and shall not he render to every man according to his works?” (Proverbs 24:11,12) “A true witness delivercth souls: but a deceitful witness speaketh lies.”—Proverbs 14: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Those who would avail themselves of the protection of the city of refuge must be informed about it and must then comply with the rules which Jehovah has laid down. The prophetic picture provided that if the slayer was not an enemy of the slain person, then the congregation should judge and try the case to determine whether the slayer might be admitted to the city of refuge. If the decision was reached that the slaying was accidental and without</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">734 </span><span class="font11">malice the slayer was permitted to dwell in the city of refuge.—Joshua 20: 6.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark146"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark147"></a>The High Priest</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">The slayer, though acquitted of the actual charge of murder, was not free to leave the city of refuge. He must remain within its confines. If he ventured outside of the “city limits’’ he might be slain by the avenger. Not until the death of the officiating high priest could the slayer go abroad with safety. But when the high priest died, and another was installed in office, the refugee might return to his own city or go where he pleased, being wholly free thenceforth. Similarly, the people of good will who now flee to God’s organization must remain there and continue in heart sympathy with Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s vindicator. They must co-operate with the “Levites”, Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Lord Jesus Christ is God’s High Priest, and the faithful footstep followers of the Lord are members of that priesthood. (Revelation 1: 6; 20: 6; 1 Peter 2: 5-9) As long as the anointed members of the royal priesthood live on earth and continue to preach “this gospel of the kingdom”, the refugees must keep in harmony and co-operation with them and their work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The prophetic provision of God's law (Numbers 35:26,27) finds its fulfillment in our day. Jehovah has graciously provided for those who now seek him. If after being thus favored by the Lord anyone fails to keep within the bounds of God’s merciful and righteous arrangement he will suffer death at the hands of God’s executioner in “the great tribulation”. One who treats the favor of Jehovah lightly, indifferently, or ignores it, loses the protection which Jehovah has provided for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At Armageddon Jehovah will destroy the murderers of the earth, and all who are in sympathy with Satan’s murderous organization. (Revelation 11:18) Those who have fled for refuge to Jehovah’s organization, under the protection of His High Priest, will be spared in that great time of trouble. But those who have once sought and found refuge on the Lord’s side and who then turn again to the unrighteous organization of the world will die justly. Jehovah’s executioner is justified in slaying them.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark148"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark149"></a>Slaughter of the Murderers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">None will ever be able to say that the slaughter at Armageddon was barbarous, unjustified or unrighteous. It will be righteous in every sense of the word, and Satan’s murderous organization will have rightly and richly merited the judgment that will be brought upon it. The murderers who out of wicked malice and for selfish gain have made the earth a slaughterhouse will themselves be slaughtered without mercy. (James 2:13) Then the earth will be clean; for only those who honor and fear Jehovah will possess it. “The meek shall inherit the earth.” (Psalm 37: 9,11) Those who will escape the great tribulation are counseled to “seek righteousness, seek meekness”.—Zephaniah 2:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In trumpet tones the witnesses of Jehovah shout the warning from the housetops. A more stupendous publicity campaign was never known. Persistently the warning and the invitation go forth: “Escape to the Kingdom,” “Come and take of the water of life.” It is not man’s message, most certainly, yet is it delivered by those who have but fleshly organisms with which to carry on their work. The value and importance of their message cannot be overstated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword [of Jehovah’s executioner] come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning, his blood shall be upon him: but he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul. When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his own righteousness [and remain not in Jehovah’s organization], and commit iniquity [become lawless], all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity [lawlessness] that he hath committed, he shall die for it.”—Ezekiel 33:4, 5,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">None can trust in his own righteousness. All have sinned and come short, and only in Jehovah’s provision for protection and refuge is there safety. Not merely by following a “moral course”, so called, will any be spared, but by heeding Jehovah’s instructions and taking the steps He prescribes. It will require more than morality to be “hid in the day of Jehovah’s anger”. Faith in God, meekness, righteousness, obedience and faithfulness in bearing the message of truth to others is required of all who are on Jehovah’s side. All the “murderers” will be destroyed; for no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.—1 John 3:15.</span></p>
