<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.” —1 Thess. 5: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH is the great Teacher, and he uses figures of speech by which lie transmits to his creatures that love him the truth, and in no uncertain terms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By the hand of the Lord Jesus Christ the faithful servant class is brought into the temple of Jehovah and there instructed concerning what they must do and what is certain to come to pass, and that within a short time. The persecuting enemies are shown to be in darkness, while they hypocritically claim to be the light of the world. Those hypocritical religionists and their allies vigorously oppose the message of and concerning Jehovah's kingdom and heap many indignities upon Jehovah’s witnesses, and thereby continue to reproach God’s name. The enemy carries out such wicked persecution and to such a point that they conclude that Jehovah’s witnesses are done for, and that the message of the Lord which greatly annoys the opponents has been successfully suppressed. As a result the enemy holds a feast and rejoices and says to all who will hear: “Peace and safety.’’ While thus congratulating one another, “sudden destruction eometh upon them.’’ The Lord in this connection uses as a figure of speech or illustration a “woman in travail” at the time of childbirth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ The word used in the Greek and translated by the English word “sudden” does not mean ‘apparent or appearing from the outward surface of things’, but means that which comes unexpectedly, as a thunderbolt out of a clear sky; that is, anything that is contrary to what the surface appearance would lead them to expect. The enemy shall be taken by surprise and astonishment, because in darkness and not on the watch. This is due to the fact that they have not the spirit of the Lord, but the spirit of the prince of darkness, their father. They think themselves to be secure. When they suddenly fall, that will to many seem very strange, because it is the work, the strange work, the act, the strange act, of God. (Isa. 28: 21) In the conclusion of his great prophecy on the end of the world Jesus said: “And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.” (Luke 21:34-3G) “Lest coming suddenly [unexpectedly </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Diaglott)],</span><span class="font4"> he find you sleeping. And what I say unto you, I say unto all, Watch.”—Mark 13: 3G, 37.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> The end of those who willfully reproach God’s name is destruction. To the. faithful remnant class the Lord says: “Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you ” (2 Thess. 1:6) The faithful remnant arc now willfully ami wrongfully persecuted by the Itoman Catholic Hierarchy and their allies, and this persecution is heaped upon them because in obedience to the Lord's commandments they continue Io herald the message of the kingdom. For their comfort the Lord, through the apostle, says to them: “And to you who arc troubled, rest with us; w’hcn the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from hcacen with his mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ; who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.”—2 Thess. 1:7-9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Manifestly those who arc to be destroyed include those who have heard the gospel of the kingdom and have refused to obey it and Lave opposed it. The words “know not”, above, have the meaning of casual vision of the truth of the kingdom, but which knowledge is treated lightly and disregarded. Such is the condition of those who compose the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. They have the Word of God and have taken a carnal vision of the same and have misapplied it to suit their own selfish desires and have disregarded its importance, and hence have not obeyed God’s Word. The text necessarily includes those who have had opportunity to know and have refused to know. There is no obligation on God's part to shield or protect anyone who does not seek his protection in the manner pointed out.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>s</sup>This scripture and supporting ones show that the destruction will come suddenly<sup>7</sup> and that the objects of God’s w’rath will see that destruction is upon them immediately before it falls. The words “cometh upon them”, as literally rendered, are “is instantaneous”; according to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Diaylott:</span><span class="font4"> “Sudden destruction impends over them.” The destruction comes from Jehovah by Christ Jesus, his “Sword”; as it is written: “There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy.” (Jas. 4:12) When those workers of iniquity begin to boast and swagger about and rejoice that Jehovah’s witnesses are out of business, and that the opposers arc at ease and peace, destruction is right then at hand, very close and immediately about to fall upon them. When they have reached the high point of utter abandon to self-peace and security by what they have accomplished wrongfully, then sudden destruction is actually upon them and they shall know it. God will not permit that old wicked and hypocritical crowd to go down to the grine in peace. His law does not change. David was God’s anointed, and other faithful men worked with him. Joab had wickedly persecuted the Lord’s people, including David, and this instruction was given to Solomon: “Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar [old and gray] head go down to the grave in peace.” (1 Ki. 2:1-G) Concerning Shimei, who cursed David and threw stones at him, the Lord said concerning this persecutor of his anointed: “His hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood.” (1 Ki. 2: 9) The Roman Catholic Hierarchy is old in years and old in crime, and the “hoar head” well represents that wicked organization. What God said in his law foreshadowed what shall come to pass upon the wicked crowd at the end of the world. God has given that wicked crowd the full length of the tether and they have reached the end of it, and destruction shall immediately fall upon them. All the wickedness that they have done will quickly flash before their faces and they will realize that their skirts, as the prophet says, are marked with human blood. They will know that their gold lace and funny hats and other paraphernalia will render them no aid and protection whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>0</sup> Upon the plains of Moab Moses, by the will of God, announced the law of the Most High concerning the hypocritical crowd that defamed his name, and upon such comes the wrath of God. “When he [tne boasting, bragging, hypocritical class that have persecuted God’s anointed, and have carried on their wicked schemes in the name of the Lord] hcareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst: The Lord will not spare him, but then the anger of the Lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the Lord shall blot out his name from under heaven.”—Dent. 29:19,20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ This law applies to the wicked persecutors of Jehovah’s witnesses. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their allies have s-.t snares or nets in which to catch and punish the anointed of God. They have repeatedly lied about God’s people and brought false witness against them in the courts and had them punished in order that those hypocritical religionists might prosecute their own wicked work. Concerning that wicked and persecuting crowd the Lord’s Word says: “Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.” (Ps. 35:8) “How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they arc utterly consumed with terrors.” (Ps. 73:19) “When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction comcth as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: for that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord: they would none of my counsel; they despised all my reproof.” (Piov. 1:27-30) “Pride gocth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.” (Prov. Ifi: 18) Such arc vessels of wrath for destruction.—Rom. 9:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> Says the text, “Cometh upon them.” Upon whom? The hypocritical Roman Catholic Hierarchy in particular, which has built a mighty organization on a basis of lies and has made a covenant with death and hell, and upon Iheir so-called “Protestant’’-clergy “yes men” and Jewish rabbis, who kowtow with them and to them, together with all their allies, who joni with them to lull to sleep the people, and who say to the simple: “AU is well; all is safe.” The priests and preachers now say unto the people: “No evil shall befall you ; we will bring peace.” In the language of the prophet they say: “Peace, peace; when there is no peace.” (Jcr. 6:14) In order to keep the people blind to the truth the preachers and priests say to them: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Ye</span><span class="font4"> shall not see the sword [the grievous trouble], neither shall ye have famine; but I (so-called ‘holy father’] will give you assured peace in this place. Then the Lord said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name; I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them : they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart. Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sv ord and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.”—Jcr. 14:13-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> The Scriptures clearly indicate that, for a time at least, the religionists, that is, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their allied “Protestant”-clergy and Ji wish “yes men”, will have the co-operation of the politic.d and commercial basses and the strong-arm squad in the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses. &quot;Without such cooperation they could not well hollo, “Peace and n.dy.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> The sudden destruction, it would seem, be'.ins at a time when the secular elements suddenly turn against the hypocritical religionists by bur-tine out in expressed hatred against “the old whore” and destroy that organization; because it is written: “God hath put fit] in their hearts to fulfil his will.” (Rev. 17:16,17) It is the work of Jehovah, the beginning of the final expression of his wrath against the enemy organization. It is “his strange work” which will awaken the political and commercial element to a revolt against the religionists and to unseat the old whore from their backs, (llab. 3:14) Jehovah caused illustrations to Ire made in his Word as to the manner of executing his wrath or vengeance upon the enemy, and one that seems clearly to foreshadow the destruction of the hypocritical crowd is that concerning Mount Seir, Moab and Ammon. Mount Heir appears to picture the religious, and Moab and Ammon the political and commercial elements. These three enemies of Israel join in an assault upon God’s chosen people, and when the attack began ‘the Lord set an ambush against them’. Then they destroyed each other in this wise; ‘‘The children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Scir, every one helped to destroy another.” (2 Chron. 20:19-23) This is supported by other scriptures, that the Lord will first &lt;le-stroy the religious hypocritical element and then will follow the destruction of all other enemies in the latter part of the battle of the great day of God Almiglny.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> It appears from the Scriptures that the final expression of God’s wrath against Satan’s organization will commence upon the religionists and then exh nd to al) workers of iniquity: ‘‘The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the Lord shall devour </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">from the one end of </span><span class="font4">the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh shall have peace. They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns; they have put themselves in pain, but shall not profit [for all their pains and efforts against Jehovah’s witnesses] ; and they shall be ashamed of your revenues, because of the fierce anger of the Lord.”—Jer. 12:12,13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> God speaks against the religious hypocrites who have committed adultery by making an alliance with the Devil and his political and commercial elements, and says: ‘‘For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their force is not right. For both jiroplict and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith the Lord. Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness; they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evil upon them, exon the year of their visitation, saith the Lord. And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria [Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which instituted the practice of man-worship]; they prophesied in Bmil [that is, the Devil religion], and caused my people Israel to err. 1 have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem [Protestants and others claiming to be worshipers of God] an horrible thing: they commit adultery [with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and other elements of Satan’s organization], and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evil doers, that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah. Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts concerning the prophets, Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profancncss gone forth into all the land. Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you; they make you vain: they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord. They say still unto them that despise me, The Lord hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you [therefore you are in safety].”—Jer. 23:10-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> It appears that when distraction is suddenly impending and about to fall upon those enemies they come suddenly to a realization that their time of visitation has arrived: ‘‘Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none. Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumor shall be upon rumor; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients. The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled; 1 will do unto them alter their way, and according to their deserts will I judge, them; and they shall know that I am the Lord.” (Ezek. 7 : 25-27) As that wicked institution has heapi d insult upon Jehovah, and injury to his people, so shall that wicked crowd be recompensed double for her iniquity. ‘‘Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works; in the cup which she hath filled, till to her double.”—Rev. 18:6; Ezek. 13: 9-16; Zech. 12:3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“TRAVAIL”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> How shall the impending destruction appear? “As travail upon a woman with child.” The illustration which the Lord gives here is clear, apt and forceful. When God expelled man from Eden, to the woman he said: “In sorrow thou shalt bring forth children”; and it has ever been so. In all the centuries motherhood has been the chief desire of women and a barren woman has in most times been a reproach. Conception is a happy hour, and during the peiiod of gestation the woman looks forward with great expectation to the coming offspring and how it shall attain to distinction in the world. A good woman desires her child to glorify the name of God. The selfish woman has desire that her child may have honor amongst men. With both, however, the approaching days of childbirth are filled with joyful anticipation. The doctor fixes the day according to his method of ealcu-lation, and the woman waits in apparent peace and safety, resting securely in the hope that soon she will bring greater honor upon herself by producing a son. But the date fixed arrives very suddenly, because upon her the pains of birth come, and she knows that she is faced with death, which may quickly occur, and only the Lord can bring her through.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>,s</sup> A woman who serves God has said in describing her experience in childbirth and the days preceding it: “In advance of the day set travail came upon me suddenly. Out of a sound sleep I was awakened with a certain knowledge that my time had come. Alone in the darkness I was faced with the ordeal with God alone to sustain me. With a sinking sensation I was shaking all over like a leaf trembling in a great wind. With increasing distress I was seized again and again with convulsions, convinced that I could bear no more. Twisting, writhing and turning with frantic desire to get away and there was no place to flee. Life seemed ebbing quickly away and I sunk into forgetfulness.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>19</sup> Addressing his disciples Jesus said: “A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come.” (John 16: 21) She is face to face with death, and only the Lord can bring her out of that terrible condition. Many women have died in childbirth, and many have escaped death, but the hypocritical religionists, concerning whom the illustration is given, “shall not escape” death, because God has decreed that destruction shall come upon them. That wicked organization will see death staring it in the face immediately before dissolution takes place.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>17</sup> “Jacob’s trouble” is an attempt of Satan and his agents to destroy God’s faithful people, and is pictured by Jacob in great distress, and out of which trouble God delivers his faithful ones. Antitypieally that trouble came upon God’s faithful ones in 1917 and J 918, and out of it they were delivered. Concerning that trouble it is written: “Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font4">see every man [not a woman, but meaning those faithful ones who acquit themselves like men] with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness? Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it; it is even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.”— Jer. 30:6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> The sudden trouble that befalls hypocritical religionists shall be like “travail upon a woman” and is different from Jacob’s trouble, in this, that there will be no way of escape or salvation for that hypocritical crowd. Then they will cry out: “We have heard the fame thereof; our hands wax feeble; anguish hath taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail.” (Jer. 6: 24) That trouble hour comes upon them suddenly and unexpectedly, when they say: “Peace, peace; everything is safe.” (Jer. 6:14) The Roman Catholic Hierarchy in particular, which has created many priests, has taught many of them to be captains or chief ones over the “Catholic population” and one to be chief thereof, and to such persecuting crowd the Lord says: “What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught them [priests, so-called ‘fathers’] to be captains, and as chief [the pope, or so-called ‘holy father’] over thee; shall not sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail ? And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered, and thy heels made bare.”—Jer. 13:21,22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>19</sup> There shall be no escape for them, because destruction is certain. It will be as with the wife of Phinchas, ‘who bowed herself and travailed and died.’ (1 Sam. 4:19,20) There will be no “twilight sleep” there to benumb the pain upon “Christendom’s” hypocritical religionists. Her degeneracy and wicked living will make her pains the more intense and her death certain. ‘And they shall in no wise escape’ </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(UotlicrJiam)</span><span class="font4">; says the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott:</span><span class="font4"> “They shall by no means escape.” It is written: “Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies; thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.” (Ps. 21: 8) So shall it be when God’s wrath is suddenly expressed against the hypocrites, who cry “Peace and safety”. “And the shepherds [including the Jesuit priests, that wily crowd that operate fraudulently&quot; in the name of Christ Jesus] shall have no way 1o flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.”—Jer. 25: 35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> Jehovah has permitted the Devil and his agents to operate in the earth for many centuries, that the day&quot; of reckoning may work a complete vindication of his name and “for to shew in thee my power; and that in.v name may be declared throughout all the ear'll”. (Ex. 9:16, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Lccscr)</span><span class="font4"> The witness work is now in progress and may be near the end, and when that &lt;nd is reached then Jehovah will show his power against ail who have reproached his name, and none shall escape.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> For many years the Roman Catholic Hierarchy&quot; has falsely taught the people and made millions believe that that institution has a covenant with death and hell and that their bulwarks are so strong and are so absolutely invulnerable that nothing can prevail against them. God’s prophet foretells of the days of reckoning in these words: “I saw the Lord standing upon the altar [of ‘Christendom’s’ false worship] ; and he said, Smite the lintel of the door [into ‘Christendom's’ religious-political, fraudulent organization], that the posts [thresholds (R.F.); that is, the clergy’s way or path] may shake; and cut them in the head, [(Z’.F.) break them in pieces on the head of] all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he that flceth of them shall not flee [shall not escape] away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered. Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they’ climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down; ami though they&quot; hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and lake them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them: and though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them; and I v. ill set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.” (Amos 9:1-4) Their destruction shall be complete.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">‘•DAY OF WRATH”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">*<sup>2</sup>The day of the beginning of the exercise of God’s power against Satan and his organization was when he enthroned his beloved Son as the world’s rightful ruler. (Ps. 2: 6) For centuries Jesus had waited until the coming of that day, even as God had commanded him: “Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.” (1’s. 110:1) The Scriptures and the facts show that it was in the autumn season of 1914 that the day of God’s power began to be exercised against the enemy, and therefore it is written: “We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come.” (Kev. 11:17,18) Then it was that Jehovah sent forth his beloved Son, saying, “Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” (Ps. 110:2) The enemy refused to voluntarily vacate, and then there followed a war in heaven. (Kev. 12:7-9) Seeing the time had come when the great issue between himself and Jehovah must be settled, the Devil plunged the nations of the world into a war, which was in fulfillment of the prophecy uttered by Jesus Christ. Satan’s purpose there was to destroy the human race. That was the beginning of sorrows upon the organization of Satan, and particularly upon the visible part thereof. “For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All these are the beginning of sorrows. ”—Matt. 24: 7, 8.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> For four years the war between the nations of earth raged, and not only were millions of the warring nations destroyed, but Satan desperately attempted to destroy those who had devoted themselves to God and his kingdom. The war in heaven was the beginning of the expression of the wrath of God against Satan’s organization, but the war on earth Jehovah did not begin. It was Satan who caused the nations to engage in war. The tribulation that was begun in heaven the Devil carried on in the earth against humankind, that he might accomplish his boastful challenge. Since he was cast out of heaven he has continued to bring woes upon the people. (Rev. 12:12) If Satan had carried out his purpose that great World War would have continued until all the human race had been wiped out. In 1918 the World War came to an end, but the earthly rulers could give no good reason why it suddenly ended. The reason is given in the Scriptures</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> God stopped the war for the sake of his elect, the faithful servant class. “And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.” (Malt. 24: 22) Had the war continued without abating until the destruction of the world, would those on earth and then in line for the kingdom have been saved&quot;? No; for the reason, all such must first be judged by Christ Jesus at the temple, which judgment began after the coming of Christ to the temple in 1918. At the coming of the. Lord to the temple even those who were in line for the kingdom were displeasing to the Lord and could not have been taken into God’s capital organization without first being judged, repenting and receiving forgiveness. This is clearly shown by the prophecy of Isaiah. It was “in the year that king Vzziah [picturing professed Christianity or ‘Christendom’] died” that, says Isaiah, “I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne [the judgment throne (Matt. 25:31)], high and lifted up, and his train filled Hie temple.” (Isa. G: 1-3) This prophetic picture shows that the time of judgment had arrived. Isaiah, here picturing those saints of God in line for the kingdom, continues to say: “Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I du ell in the midst of a people [professed followers of Christ Jesus] of unclean lips [failing to bear witness to the kingdom], for mine eyes have seen the King: the Lord of hosts.”—Isa. 6:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> Then at the judgment by the Lord at the temple the faithful were cleansed, and this is pictured by the woi ds of the prophet: “Then flew one of the si raphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar; ami he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.” (Isa. 6:6,7) The facts strongly support the conclusion that this cleansing took place in 1922, when God’s faithful people on earth came to know that Christ Jesus is at the temple. Then the Lord, having cleansed those found faithful, sent them forth to be his witnesses, as foreshadowed by the prophet's words: “I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me. And he said, Go and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; ami see ye indeed, but perceive not.” (Isa. 6: 8, 9) The prophecy then tells of the joy of those cleansed and who obey the commandment of the Lord to bear witness to the kingdom. (Isa. 12:1-4) The facts that have come to pass exactly fit the words of the prophecy, and since 1922 there has been a constant movement forward on the part of the elect to give testimony to the name of Jehovah and his kingdom. Had the war continued without cessation, they would not have given that testimony in obedience to the commandment of ihe Lord, and therefore it was for their (that is, the elect’s) sake that the tribulation was cut short by stopping the war in 1918 until the witness woik is done. The Lord temporarily stopped his v.ai upon Satan for that reason, and Satan then knew that his time is very short to prepare for the final expression of the wrath of God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">“ Had not the war been stopped in 1918, would the ‘‘great multitude” have been saved? No; for the reason, the “great multitude” was not then in existence and could not be until the judgment of the house of God at the temple, and the selection of the elect. It has been only in recent mouths that the great multitude came into view of the remnant. Now the remnant must carry the message of truth to those persons of good will toward God in order that those may learn of God and his King and have opportunity to seek meekness and righteousness, that they may be saved in the day of God’s expressed wrath. (Zeph. 2:24) The obligation is laid upon the remnant to bear before the peoples and nations the fruits of the kingdom, that is to say, the life-giving and life-sustaining food from the Word of God. This not only means </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">privilege, but means a mandate from Jehovah and Christ Jesus that cannot be avoided by those who will be loyal and who will ultimately be of the royal house. “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations, and then shall the end come.” That statement of the Lord is positive and certain, and as soon as </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">witness work is done, “then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.” From the end of the war until the final tribulation the way is made clear for the elect to work as commanded, and that explains why there has been such a great witness work given in tiic earth since 1922.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” The “wrath of God” shall be expressed in a much more marked degree than ever before. Clearly that expression of final wrath will begin with the execution of judgment upon professed “Christianity”, that is to say, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which takes the lead in hypocritical religion, and upon all her allies and supporters. It is the Ixtrd Jesus Christ, God’s mighty Sword and Executioner, that will give expression to the divine wrath, and there “the day of the Lord Jesus Christ” comes ujion all hypocritical and unbelieving ones “as a thief </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">the night”. When the witness work is done, it seems, God will permit it </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">be stopped and then the religionists, who have so violently opposed God and his kingdom message, will consider that they have stopped the “pestiferous” witnesses of Jehovah. They begin to act hilariously, like drunken men, and then suddenly God’s wrath is expressed against them, and no part of their organization or people will be able to escape. It is the Lord’s work, and, expressed against the religionists, it will seem strange to many. Thus it is made clearly to appear that the wrath of God began to be expressed against Satan’s organization in 1914; that he cut it short in 1918; that the witness work is in progress; that when that witness work is done, then God’s wrath will again be expressed against every part of Satan’s organization, commencing with the religionists, and continue until both the visible and the invisible part of the Devil’s organization is destroyed, the Devil himself being the last to be destroyed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> The Lord gives this information to the elect before it comes to pass. And why? The answer is, says the apostle, “That we [the elect, of whom Paul was one] through patience [that is, steadfastly pushing on amidst great opposition and confidently trusting in the Lord] and comfort of the scriptures [an understanding thereof] might have hope.” (Rom. 15:4) Otherwise many of those who have covenanted to do the will of God might faint under the opposition and fall by the way. God has graciously made provision that those who love him may stand. To contrast the condition of those in darkness with the faithful followers of Christ Jesus in this day the apostle says: “But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.”—1 Thess. 5:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> The “brethren” here mentioned are such as are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord to the temple, and these are the ones that are “caught up . . . in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we [if continuing faithful] ever be with the Lord” in the temple and its glorious light. Since the opening of the temple there is great light. The glory of Jehovah God there shines in the face of Christ Jesus and is reflected upon those of the temple class, and such must let their light so shine that the great multitude may see that the kingdom is at hand and that they also may have part in the telling of its blessedness.—2 Cor. 3:14-18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>30</sup> Those who cry “Peace and safety” are in darkness, but the wise virgins are in the light. The “evil servant” class the Lord by his angels has gather&lt; d out from those in line for the kingdom and has cast them into outer darkness, and they gnash their te&lt; th upon the faithful, who continue to proclaim the kingdom message. (Matt. 13:41) The “evil servant” class continue to scoff at the truth concerning the Lord Jesus’ Doing at the temple, and this they do because they are in darkness. Some who still think themselves in the truth but who are of the “elective elder” cla.-s continue to say: “There is nothing now or enlightening in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> these days”; and they so say because they are in darkness, not being of the temple, neither are they of the Jonadab class. Such claim to have fellowship with God, and yet they continue in darkness; concerning whom it is written: “This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth; but if wc walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son elcanseth us from all sin.” (1 John 1:5-7) Those who arc faithful to Cod, and whom Christ Jesus has brought into the temple, are in the light by the grace of the Lord.—Col. 1:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>31</sup> Being in the light of the temple, ‘that day does not overtake the faithful as a thief,’ meaning that particular part of the day when sudden destruction cometh upon those who say “Peace and safety’’. “The day of the Lord Jesus Christ” began even on the elect as a thief, but they awoke and hastened to obey the Lord, and after 1922 went forward in obedience to the Lord’s commandment, proclaiming his kingdom message. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version</span><span class="font4"> translation of the above text is not so clear by reason of using the word “overtake”. According to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font4"> it reads: “That the day upon you as upon thieves should lay hold.” Thieves found breaking in during the nighttime were legally slain, and that without violation of the everlasting covenant. (Ex. 22:2) Now the thieves of “Christendom”, the hypocritical religionists and the “evil servant” class, that are trying to break into the kingdom and at the same time steal the devotion and worship from Jehovah Cod and take the honor’ unto themselves, by crying “Peace and safety”, will be killed without violation of the everlasting covenant. The curse of Cod shall be upon such thieves. (Zech. 5:1-4) The “evil servant” class have consented, connived at and aided and abetted these thieves and hence arc parties to the crime and will end in the same way: “When thou sawest a thief, then thou conscntcdst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.” —Ps. 50:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>32</sup> Cod is light, and Christ is the light of the world; and the elect, being the sons of Cod, are sons of light, and therefore says the scripture: “Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.” (1 Thcss. 5: 5) Such arc “children of the day” because they are born of Cod’s woman and are sons of Cod, upon whom in the day of the Lord Jesus Jehovah has bestowed his holy name. They are sons of the Father of lights (Jas. 1:17), and hence brethren of the Lord Jesus Christ. They are brought forth by the Lord and exhibited to the world “for signs and for wonders”. (Isa. 8:18; JIcb. 2:13) Being Cod’s children, they are all taught of God and continue to walk in his light.—Isa. 54:13.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>83</sup> Those in darkness, spiritually speaking, arc idolaters, thieves, thugs, drunkards, rioters and revelers, and all rebel against the light. They know not the ways thereof. “They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof. The murderer rising with the light killcth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief. The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me; and disguis-eth his face. In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime; they know not the light. For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death [lest they be caught and identified] : if one know them, they are in the tcirors of the shadow of death.” (Job 24:13-17) Such love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil. (John 3:19) They delight to persecute all who faithfully tell the truth, because the truth makes manifest their deeds of wickedness and brings torment upon them. They and their allies arc asleep as to their opportunities and privileges of knowing God and his kingdom and serving the King.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>34</sup> Continuing his admonition to those on the side of the Lord and who are in the light, the apostle says: “Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober” (1 Thcss. 5:6); meaning, do not now permit yourselves to fall asleep, but be on the lookout, on the alert, and ready, watchful and anxious at all times to have a part in the service and to well care for the interests of the kingdom which the Lord has committed into the hand of the “faithful and wise servant” class. At all times and under all circumstances resist the Devil and let your forehead be as adamant against the enemy, and firmly stand in the Lord and for his kingdom. Such faithful ones will not lie indifferent to an opportunity of service, but will be eager to grasp the opportunity to joyfully perform the duties accompanying it. Instead of being in confusion and befuddled, like drunken men who imbibe the wme of the Devil’s organization, the faithful will be sober and will watch. They will ‘drink the wine of joy of the Lord new in the kingdom’, because the kingdom is here and the time for the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and those who will have a part therein must be in the joy of the Lord Jesus Christ. —Luke 22:18; Matt. 26: 29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>85</sup> Night is the time for sleep ; and because they that cry “Peace and safety” have no light they are of the night, and so they sleep. “For they’ that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in t lie night.” (1 Thcss. 5:7) They are drunken with the wine of Satan endeavoring to carry out his policies, because they are his children, and they are wrapt in the night with all of Satan’s crowd. While it is not the duty' of those who are in the light to execute judgment upon another, yet this is the time of judgment, because the Lord is here and now is the time when ‘by their limits ye shall know them’. (Matt. 7:16) If the fruits they bear consist of doctrines employed to influence the people, and if you come in contact with those who are promulgating a selfish teaching that tends to turn men an ay' from God and turns them to the worship of man, know that such are the children of the wicked one. If you see and hear men scoff at the truth of and concerning the Lord’s being at the temple for judgment, and continue to eulogize other men whether dead or alive, know that such are m darkness and are committing the “sin of Samaria”. All such as seek by “good words and fair speeches”, or by’ other means, to deceive the simple and turn them away’ from complete devotion to and service of the Lord, know that such arc of the night; therefore have nothing to do with them.—Rom. 16:17,18.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">’• Those who are in the temple, and hence with the Lord, are “of the day”. Being brought into the temple, Jehovah says to such: “Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people; but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.” (Isa. 60:1, 2) Those who are in the temple stand out separate and distinct from those who are in the darkness, and they must show, by holding high the message of truth and proclaiming it to others, that they are the sons of God. They have been called forth as his witnesses and must show forth the praises of him who has called them out of darkness into the marvelous light. (1 1’et. 2: 9,10) “Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.”—Matt. 13:43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” Those faithful ones, who are of the day, cannot have fellowship with those in darkness, but “let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation”. (1 Thcss. 5:8) The day of the Lord Jesus Christ is the day on which the sons of God have been born by Jehovah’s woman, and the brightness of that day will not permit anyone in the light to do wrong toward his brethren and get away with it. The Lord will not permit him to do injury to the kingdom interests and let that wrongful act go unnoticed. The remnant will now see the absolute necessity of being sober, fully awake, steady, serious, and filled with the joy of the Lord, watching carefully to do their duty and acquit themsehes like men. This is the day of warfare, and God’s sons must be joyfully engaged in the battle. “Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning; thou hast the dew of thy youth.”—Ps. 110:3.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>39</sup> To be equipped for this fight, the apostle says, ‘Put on the breastplate of faith’ by reason of our knowledge and confident reliance upon God’s truth; our affections must be wholly set upon the Lord and his kingdom, and we must be blind to everything else. The remnant must keep a clear mind; hence there must be a. helmet for the protection of the head, and for that helmet, says the apostle, ‘put on the hope of salvation.’ The vindication of Jehovah's name means the salvation of the remnant. The knowledge that this is the day for the vindication of his name, and that the faithful may now have a part in that vindication, should be a great hope and safeguard to the head, and the result is a clear understanding of the doctrines now due to be understood. From the de-criptien, this equipment here described means war. It is the time for the battle of the great day of God Almighty, and it seems clear from the Word of the Lord that some of the faithful will see that battle and be carried through it while on the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>80</sup> Even though this is the day of the wrath of God, he has not appointed his own people to wnath: “For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.” (1 Thcss. 5: 9,10) The wicked arc “vessels of wrath fitted to destruction”; but not so with the faithful remnant. This is the day of the Lord Jesus Christ, because he is Jehovah’s Vindicator, and in this day Jehovah’s name will be completely vindicated. Christ Jesus died for all who believe on him and serve him and Jehovah, and this is true whether they sleep in death until he comes or be alive at his coming. These latter mentioned are the ones that are caught up with the Lord to meet him in the air, that is, in the temple, and that enter for ever into the house of Jehovah when they maintain their integrity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>40</sup> True to his loving-kindness and his way of dealing with those who love him, the Lord has graciously permitted his people in this time of judgment to have a better and clearer view of the time of tribulation upon the world and what is the proper relationship of the remnant thereto. Chapter four of First Thessalonians informs the faithful concerning the resurrection of those who have died in faith, and the exaltation into the temple of those living and remaining faithful at the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. The faithful arc told to “comfort one another with these words” now. The apostle admonishes concerning the day of God’s wrath and says to his people: “Wheic-fore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.”—1 Thess. 5:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>41</sup> Such is the reason why the Lord permits the«c truths to be published in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The, Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> What is said is not the opinion of man, and no man is to be given credit therefor. The Lord has his own good way of informing and comforting his people. While the remnant need no man to teach them, it is the privilege of the remnant to be fed by Jehovah and Cluisl Jesus upon the food convenient for them in this day, and to that end the Lord causes an understanding ef the Scriptures and permits these to be published in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> It is the privilege and duty of all companies of Jehovah’s witnesses, together with the Jona-dabs, to be obedient to this commandment and to study these precious truths, and to thus comfort one another, even as all such arc now doing. Happy is their state while so doing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>42</sup> In this connection the apostle presses upon his brethren the necessity of dwelling together in peace: “Be at peace among yourselves,” and “to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake”. “See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever fellow that which is good, both among yoursehes, and 1o all men.”—1 Thess. 5:13,15. •</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>43</sup> If you find amongst the company of biethren those who are covetous, who gender strife and con'usion, who manifest the spirit of selfishness, know that such are not of the temple company. Iio not imlulee ri controversies with them, render no evil unto them, but follow the admonition of the apostle and avoid them. The faithful remnant must continue in peace together and must have and manifest the joy of the Lord, and with zeal perform the privileges and obligations laid upon them by the Lord. The unity of the temple class now exists, and those who do not show the spirit of harmony and unity thereby give evidence that they arc outside the temple. This is the time when .the anointed of the Lord truly sing: “Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!’’ (Ps. 133:1) With sobriety of mind and with full confidence the anointed will move forward, looking with joy to the early vindication of the name of Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>HIGHWAY FOR THE PEOPLE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">T</span><span class="font4">HE facts arc that in the denominational church organizations, both Catholic and Protestant, there arc today many souls hungry for the truth, and yet the clergy, who arc virtual prison keepers, do their best to keep them from knowing the truth of the sacred Scriptures. In their distress these hungry souls (prisoners they are) pray unto God and cry and sigh because of all the abominations which arc done in the midst of the organization of “Christendom’’ and which they cannot reconcile with the God whose name “Christendom’’ has adopted and then wickedly brought reproach upon it.—Ezek. 9: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Through his prophet God foretells of a time when he would hoar the cries of these prisoners and send relief, and then shows that the time that such relief would be sent would be after the building up of his organization, which is Zion. This proof shows a work that those who arc God’s temple class must do, and one reason for giving the witness. The psalm-prophecy reads: “When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory. He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer. This shall be written for the generation to come; and the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord. For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the Lord [Jehovah] behold the earth; to hear the groaning of the prisoner, to loose those that are appointed to death [his faithful remnant].” (Ps. 102:16-20) But now still others aside from God’s remnant still remain as prisoners of Satan’s organization Babylon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord has, just at the right time, brought the radio into action, which permits the people to remain in their homes and listen to the proclamation of the truth, regardless of the opposition of the prison keepers, the clergy. Knowing this, the clergymen unite with Big Business to control the radio and, if possible, to prevent the truth from being broadcast. The Lord has also provided a great number of books explaining the Bible, and his faithful witnesses go from house to house and put these in the hands of the people that the prisoners may have some food. The prophet shows then that God will open the prison doors by giving those who honestly seek the truth an opportunity to hear and know him. “Praise ye the Lord . . . which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is; which keepcth truth for ever; which execute! h judgment for the oppressed; which giveth food to the hungry. The Lord looseth the prisoners: the Lord openeth the eyes of the blind: the Lord raiseth them that are bowed down: the Lord loveth the righteous.” —Ps. 146: 1-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The proof shows, therefore, that the honest ones in the denominational church organizations who desire to know God and his Word are hungry and in distress, and that they cry for help; and that the clergy arc the prison keepers who render no help and concerning whom God says: “Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my Hock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more.”— —Ezek. 34:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And then God, through his prophet, shows how he will bring relief to such prisoners by giving them a knowledge of the truth. Through his prophet he says to the faithful “servant” class, those who are of the temple class and whom he has appointed as his witnesses: ‘I have called you in righteousness, and I will hold your hand, and sustain you and give you the power. I will send you to open the blind eyes and to bring the prisoners from the prison houses and them that sit iu darkness out of the prison. That you may say to the prisoners, Go forth ; to them that are in darkness, Show yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.’ —Isa. 42: 5-7 ; 49: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is one of the reasons why the testimony of the truth of God’s Word must now be given by the temple class; and that work is now progressing in fulfillment of prophecy. That is the reason why faithful men and women go from house to house with books that explain the Bible, and place them in the hands of the people on contribution. That is the way they preach the gospel, because it is God’s appointed way. The effect of giving the testimony by radio, by books, and by other means, is to separate or divide the people. It brings the honest, persons of good will, who want to serve God, out from those who are hypocrites. It is neither the purpose, nor the result, to get anyone to join an organization of men; but the testimony is given to enable them to get their eyes opened and to take their stand on the side of Jehovah God. God having commanded this testimony to be given to the prisoners, his witnesses must deliver the testimony; otherwise they could not be pleasing to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There arc millions of people of good will in the world who are no part of Satan’s organization but who are under the influence and control of that oppressive organization. They are not held in the church prison Louses, but are on the outside. They see the hypocrisy in the. churches and hold themselves aloof therefrom. They arc blind to the truth, however, and Satan has caused their blindness. (Isa. 42:7; 2 Cor. 4:3,4) It is God’s purpose that such persons may have an opportunity to learn the truth and have their eyes, which menus their understanding, opined to enable them to take their stand on the side of Jehovah God and against the Devil. Jehovah, through his prophet, foretold that he would make provision for this work, and he has made provision for it. By his prophet he foretold that he would make an everlasting covenant with Christ, his beloved Son, w'ho was foreshadowed by the anointed David, and that others would be brought into that covenant, and that the ones faithful to that covenant should be members of his “servant” that is approved. As the mouthpiece of Jehovah God, the prophet says: “Behold my servant, whom I uphold, mine elect, in whom my soul delight-eth; I have put my spirit upon him; he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.” And then, addressing those who are invited to enter into the covenant for the kingdom with Christ the great antitypieal David, the prophet says: “Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.”—Isa. 42:1-6 ; 55:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That Jehovah provides these witnesses of his to do a work for the benefit of the people is made clear. Through his prophet he said: “Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.” (Isa. 55: 4) These words of the prophet apply primarily to Jesus Christ, who declared that he came into the world that he might be a witness to the truth. They apply to all who are in Chrht, which includes those who are in the temple and therefore of Zion, God’s organization. The last members of The Christ on earth are therefore designated by Jehovah as his witnesses to the people, and the obligation laid upon them is made plain. Under Ihc supervision of the great Witness Christ Jesus, these are to be made, and are made, “a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The remnant constitute the “feet of him”, the great Witness, that is to say, the last members on earth of the body of Christ, which is the true church ; and they are therefore of Zion and in the spiritual temple of God and, being yet on earth, are standing at the very borders of God’s glorious kingdom. These are God's watchmen, and he speaks of them as being placed upon the walls of Jerusalem, which represents the organization of his people on earth; and then through his prophet he says of and concerning them: “I have s'.t watchmen upon thy walls, 0 Jerusalem, which shall never' hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not silence.”—Isa. 62:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The remnant must continue to give the witness, even unto the time of entering the kingdom. The entrance thereinto is symbolized by the expression “the gates”, and, addressing the remnant class who are his witnesses, Jehovah says: “Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, ea t up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.”—Isa. 62:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With their faces toward the heavenly kingdom the faithful witnesses are pointing Ilie people to the right way. These faithful ones arc ‘preparing the wav- or the people’ by telling them the reason for their blindness and oppression, and of God’s gracious provision to release them from their burdens and to show them the way to endless life. This is not an effort to convert the world, such as the clergy have pretended that they could do, but it is a campaign of education, informing the people according to God’s commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These faithful witnesses “cast up the highway” for the people by showing them that God has provided a great, broad and clear way for man to return to him and to receive everlasting blessings. These witnesses are commanded to “gather out the stones”, which is a part of the work of preparing the way for the people. Satan the enemy, through the operation of his agents, and particularly the clergy, has placed many stumbling stones in the way of the people, xlmong such stumbling stones are the falsehoods, that God is responsible for all the evil of the world; that God takes little children away in death because he wants them; that God causes all the sickness and suffering of man on earth; and that when man dies, if he is outside the church, he is to be for ever tormented in fire and brimstone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another great stone in the way of the people is that, as they have been told by the clergy, “this present evil world” is God’s kingdom on earth; that therefore God is responsible for the oppression under the wicked rulership of the nations. The people must be told the truth, to wit, that Satan the Devil is “the god of this world” and that so-called “Christendom” is a blasphemy of God’s holy name, because it assumes to represent Christ, the beloved Son of Jehovah. The people must be told that Jehovah is the only true and almighty God, and that his way is always right because he is love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The witnesses are commanded to “lift up a standard for the people”. A standard means a guidon or staff to which the people may rally and identify themselves with a specific side in a fight. The standard to be lifted up for the people is God’s standard concerning salvation and his government of righteousness. The people must be told that Satan is the real enemy of mankind and that Jehovah is man’s true and everlasting Friend. This must be done in order that all the people of good will may have opportunity to take, their stand on the side of the Lord God and under his standard.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark7"></a>THE OUTCOME OF ARMAGEDDON</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">A</span><span class="font4">RMAGEDDON, which means the “hill of the gathering of troops”, marks the place and the time where and when the supreme issue will be finally and for ever decided, namely, &quot;Who is the Mast High God? and who will rule the earth? Using .symbolic language to describe the unseen and intangible influences which are now at work to bring all the governing powers of earth together for this final battle, Revelation 16:13,14,16 says: “And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon [Satan’s entire organization], and out of the mouth of the beast [Satan’s visible, earthly organization], and out of the mouth of the false prophet [the Anglo-American imperialistic system]. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. And [(R.V.) they] gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The great and terrible day of God Almighty, the battle of Armageddon, will be marked with such a deceive victory for righteousness that all will know it. The name of Jehovah, who is God, will be exalted in the earth. Even the clergy shall have their mouths forever closed to shaking presumptuously concerning the Lord God. Now they name themselves ‘shepherds of the flock’. They have brought into the flock as the principal men the profiteers and politicians and men of great influence. G’od’s prophet, describing the expression of God’s anger against these wicked systems and false prophets, and thus giving another description of Armageddon, sajs: “Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground. Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape. A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the Lord hath spoiled their pasture. And the peaceable habitations are cut dov n, because of the fierce anger of the Lord.”—Jer. 25: 32-37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another of God’s prophets gives a vivid picture of the great and terrible day of the Lord. The sea, being a great, restless body of water that is constantly lashing itself against the rocks, fitly represents the ungodly people of earth, alienated from Jehovah God and selfishly bearing up the commercial organization that the Devil has built like a sea-faring ship, to exploit the peoples. The prophet, in the prophecy about to be quoted, uses the sea as a symbol of such. Ships are used as a symbol of pre-ent methods of carrying on great commercial enterprises. The financial interests of the world are really the backbone of the present visible organization of the enemy, Satan the Devil. The prophet refers to the time when Satan’s organization will reach the point of assembling or being assembled for Armageddon, saying, “They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters.” —Ps. 107:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the deep distress that comes upon the nations they discern the Lord; that is, they see the manifestation of his power in these troublesome events, even as described in the prophecies, such as the prophecy of Habakkuk. Then the psalmist, whom we are now quoting, pictures Jehovah as commanding the fight to begin. The conflict is represented as a stormy wind. A stormy wind is always used as a symbol of trouble. The prophet proceeds and thus describes the scope of the trouble, and the result: “For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths; their soul is melted because of trouble. They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits’ end. Then they [the people of good will who have been associated with the commercial organization] cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven [Jehovah’s organization].”—Ps. 107:25-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord Jesus refers to the same great battle of Armageddon that would follow the World War after an interval of time, when he says: ‘‘For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.”—Matt. 24:21,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The people may confidently rely upon the statement of Jesus that this will be the end of tribulation upon the earth, because he says there shall never be another. lie also states that many will pass through this trouble and live, and not die; and all should take courage from this who desire to see a better condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another of the prophets shows that in this time of trouble those will be destroyed who compose the symbolic ‘‘beast” (that is to say, the Devil’s visible earthly organization) and the ‘‘false prophet” class. This scripture and its context read as follows: ‘‘And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against [Christ Jesus] that sat on the horse, and against his army [in heaven]. And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image [‘the abomination of desolation’, or League of Nations]. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone,” that is to say, into ‘‘everlasting destruction”, annihilation. (Rev. 19:19-21) Thus these two wicked systems will be completely destroyed; and those people who give allegiance and support and aid and comfort to them will doubtless also go down. The ones that will be brought through are Jehovah’s faithful remnant and that class of people who will have taken their stand on the side of Jehovah God and his kingdom. Thus the Jonadabs survive the trouble and will then have the opportunities of complete reconstruction and blessing. Without doubt there are a great many people who are now held in bondage to Satan’s organization by reason of the fact that they are blinded to God’s purposes. The enemy Satan has blinded them, lest the glorious good news of God’s kingdom should shine into their minds and lest they should understand and believe and break away from the Devil’s system. (2 Cor. 4: 4) The Lord Jesus, speaking of the conclusion of this old world and of the manifestation of his kingdom, said: ‘‘And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man, in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory.” (Matt. 24: 30) It is manifest from this scripture that all 1hc peoples will seo, in the great battle of Armageddon, that it is the Lord dashing to pieces Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The stubborn and willful (‘‘goats”), who continue to support the systems in defiance of God, will go down with them. Doubtless now is the time when they who by deceit and fear have been held in bondage to the Devil’s organization must break away and must call upon the Lord, and then he will bring them through the time of trouble. The Lord has specially promised favors to those who are good to the Lord’s ‘‘poor”, his witnesses on earth. Through his prophet he says: ‘‘Blessed is he that considered! the poor: the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble. The Lord will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.”—Ps. 41:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These mentioned here as coming to the knowledge that the great trouble is to be a manifestation of God’s power and glory shining through his kingdom will doubtless call upon the name of the Lord, at the same time taking their position openly on his side, and he will hear them and bring them through the trouble; and then, if they are obedient to him, he will give them the blessings long ago promised to come through ‘‘the seed of Abraham”, that is to sav, through the Christ. — Isa.41: 8; Rom. 9: 7; Gal. 3:16, 27-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The prophet of God again refers to the same time, when he says: ‘‘Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord [Jehovah], to serve him with one consent.”—Zeph. 3: 8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This will mark the end of Satan’s organization and the deliverance of the people therefrom. Then, as the prophet here says, God will turn to them a pure message, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord and serve him with one consent. Then will follow the establishment of conditions upon the earth such as will make it a fit place upon which to live. Such will be the work of the Messiah, The Christ, and the next step in the outworking of the divine purpose.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark9"></a>MEMORIAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">T</span><span class="font4">HE date for the celebration to the name of Jehovah God and to the sacrifice of Christ Jesus is determined in this manner: From the observation of the new moon nearest to the vernal equinox, which marks the first day of the first month, count fourteen days. (Ex. 12:1-6) According to astronomical calculations the moon rises at least sixteen hours before it can be seen with the natural eye of man. In the time of Moses the calculation was made from the hour he eould sec the moon with the naked eye, and that is the proper manner for us to count the time. This year (called A.l). 1936) begins on the 21th day of March; and the fourteenth day, to wit, after 6 p.m. of April 6, is the proper time for the celebration of the Memorial. Jerusalem time is used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The book entitled </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font4"> contains a more detailed explanation of the Memorial than </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">could carry at one issue. Carefully and prayerfully study chapters two and three of the book entitled </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah,</span><span class="font4"> beginning at page 26 and ending at page 120. Then on the 6th day of April, after 6 p.m., let each company of the anointed assemble and celebrate the Memorial. In doing so, use unleavened bread and real red wine. Unfermented grape juice or raisin juice will not meet the requirements. The Lord and the apostles used real red wine, and we should follow their lead.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In one little town there were just sixteen houses, but the lecture from the sound car was so much appreciated that 18 books and 16 booklets were left there. (How clear the lectures ring forth up here!) One lady said, “Oh, to think this message is brought right to mj home, mid I never heard it before! 1 surely want to tell everyone of the joy it has brought me. And to think this card tells it all and no salesmanship is necessary! ’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In visiting a dam, we found an old man, 70 years of age, who appreciated the message so much ne said it was the happiest day of his life. He contributed for all of our publications, a record, and also for some gasoline to carry on the work.</span></p>

At Hetch Bctchy dam vve took them by surprise and put on a lecture before they knew what it was all about.

It was fine.’’ Seeing tho testimony card, and before it could bo presented, he grabbed it, read it aloud, and said, “Bring those three books to my house; I surely want them.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every few miles wo find groups of tents with miners in them who are woiking very haid for an existence. They appreciate tho kingdom message, and, though they have very little, they contribute that they may help others receive the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The other day, when we were giving a lecture in Mariposa (the county seat), a leporter came up to us and said, “Mariposa seldom has a treat like this.’’ After asking us a few questions, she left us. The enclosed clipping was in the paper yesterday, and several people called our attention to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our hearts are so overflowing with tho privilege of service given us here, and as vve look over the previous report without a sound car and this one with a sound ear vve thought pel haps you might enjoy a compaiison. Tho sound car is surely a gicat provision Jehovah has made for his people.</span></p>
