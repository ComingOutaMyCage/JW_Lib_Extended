<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE worst insult ever given to the American flag is the present conspiracy originated by the Devil or his prime minister Gog to force the free American people to bow to the emblem of their military power. If this scheme, which the American Legion has been betrayed into backing, were to succeed, the American republic would be at an end, replaced by a Jesuit-Fascist regime in which all that the flag stands for would be dragged in the dust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A surprisingly large number of editors of the greatest newspapers in the United States see the situation clearly. They well know that in America the people are supposed to rule; the government is supposed to be the servant. The Jesuit idea is the reverse, that the pope and those who bow to his will are the rulers and that the people should be, and, it is their intention, must be made to be, for ever subject to their will.</span></p>

Is it patriotism to stand before a flag and raise your hand to your right brow if your heart is not in the action? If love of country is to be inculcated, it would seem that the proper thing to do would be to have that government so wise and kind and good as to deserve respect. Many a parent has learned to his sorrow that you cannot command a child’s love. You can force obedience, but not respect. One somehow expects better things of Massachusetts than this spectacle of bringing a child into court for refusing a salute it did not feel because it recognized only a higher and more powerful government.” (See also </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font8">No. 421, page 69.)</span></p>

They forget that this nation was founded on a belief in the sacredness of liberty and freedom to all. . . . Their shortsightedness cannot be condemned too strongly. . . . We are in no danger from Communism in America. We have a representative and a beneficent leadership. We have an enlightened people. Communism* does not grow in such an environment.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">American radio listeners and newspaper readers, February 12. 1936, were greatly Interested In the news from Germany that 150 priests and others had been arrested, caught with possessing and distributing Communist literature.

There are many teachers who would be safer and better to have in the schools who resent taking the oath than many others who will take it with alacrity. Many teachers, who are good Americans, and who as teachers are interested only in teaching their courses in a way which ■will prepare their students for life in any form of society, detest having their patriotism questioned or measured by pomp and display.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">For the first time in history, since the Roman Empire was founded, there is here presented an actual photograph of a Roman triumph. Notice with what dignity Emperor Ambrose stands on the deck of the chariot. Notice, too, the almost human expression of the horses, and how happy the various characters seem to be who are taking part in the celebration—at least they don’t seem to be unhappy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The Hemet </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">News: </span><span class="font8">“ . . . that method of patriot making is foreign to all that America and its constitution and flag stand for. What that is has been expressed by numerous phrases, freedom of conscience, academic freedom, free speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion. But it all sums up to the same thing, the liberty of the individual to his own private opinions, the liberty to form them by examining all the evidence available, the liberty to express them freely, even to the extent of criticism of those who occupy positions of political authority over him. That is the very cornerstone of our democratic republic. Persecuting little children because they have been brought up . . . with conscientious scruples against doing obeisance to a symbol of earthly authority, insulting teachers by questioning their good citizenship, harrying college students because in their youthful enthusiasm they may feel they have found something better than the existing order, these are not the way to promote the ideals of government of the people, by the people and for the people. What they do is only to ape the methods of those systems of European government which we would avoid. . . . However different their economic objectives may be, there is something strikingly similar about the political governments of Russia, Italy and Germany. The emphasis on military force, the suppression of free speech, the suppression of a free press, meddling with religion, the blood purge, are common to all of them. They are hateful to the American sense of civil liberty. They are no less hateful when the spirit which is back of them appears in our own land under the guise of protecting our own institutions from foreign influence.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hollywood </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">CitizenNews:</span><span class="font8"> “This matter of being forcibly shoved into outward acts of so-called ‘loyalty<sup>1</sup> suits the Hitler-Mussolini combination well, but is distasteful to the intelligent American. If there is anything which cannot be regimented, it’s loyalty. There are places where flag saluting can be demanded with perfect propriety, but that place is hardly the public school. . . . Let’s interpret for the youngsters the meaning of ‘with liberty and justice for all’. . . . They should be told how frequently criminals control such important offices as that of a sheriff or a district attorney or a chief of police and how under such conditions we cannot expect justice. They should be told how some governors appoint judges for purely political purposes without integrity and ability entering into the consideration and how such appointments result in the frequent denial of 'justice’ that even children hear about. They should be told how the 'republic’ for which the flag stands is worth our prizing most highly, how it brings us liberty that people in dictator-ruled countries such as Russia, Italy and Germany and military-ruled countries such as Japan do not enjoy.

A close historical analogy to Jehovah’s witnesses is that of the Quakers. Jehovah’s witnesses refuse to salute the flag as an act of idolatry. Ancient Quakers refused to doff their hats in courts of law for like reason, or to bear arms in defense of their country, and were sent to jail for it.

But compulsion inevitably destroys the foundation of that loyalty, which grows out of the individual’s own appreciation of the blessings of national unity and freedom. A democracy which is tottering may feel obliged to compel a show of patriotism on the part of disaffected groups.

Yet the flag-wavers arise in this ‘land of the free' to protest that one who dislikes to make a public exhibition of his patriotism is not a good citizen and should be deported. To my mind, the doubt ful loyalty is that of people who make a great display of it with much hat-tipping, flag-saluting and martial music. Still, such as these would set themselves up as judges, and want to force others to perform public salutes and to take unnecessary oaths of allegiance to our Government. . . . Among these ‘flag-wavers’ are individuals who are quick to criticize many acts of our Government, especially during the present administration.

There was no disloyalty in their hearts against the flag. They just wanted to take a firm stand in their loyalty to their Creator. They, in their childish hearts, know that the flag, amongst millions of other things of earth, is being given more worship than the living God. We have in our midst one little girl who is being paid $5,000 just to amuse the public, while these innocent little tots will likely be thrown into a hateful, disgraceful reform school for punishment because they showed their allegiance to their Lord and Master. This proves what I have repeatedly said, the power of the beast lies in our schools and educational halls. I love the flag, but I could not let it stand between me and my God. They talk of the cruelty of the persecution of the religious element by the scourges of ‘Red Russia’ and ‘Hitlerism’. Have we not got it right here in our midst? It is just the continuation of the ‘Pharisees’.— S. A. Shaw.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Seattle </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Star:</span><span class="font8"> “Three innocent, unsuspecting slips of girls who, until a few days ago were just plain doll-playing, rope-skipping little Americans, are about to be transformed into full-fledged patriots by compelling them to salute the flag—or else the reformatory for them. Idiocy? Yes, but there is a more fitting and damning term—tyranny! ... It is just possible, too, that these little victims of arrogance intuitively understand that American patriotism consists quite as much in contempt for tyranny as in fealty to the flag.—Frank E.

<p><span class="font8">Tacoma </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Labor Advocate:</span><span class="font8"> “It is partly a question of religious freedom, too. And since the flag has stood for the principles enunciated in the Declaration of Independence, proclaiming the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, we take it that religious liberty is not the last or least of such forms of general freedom as the revolutionary fathers proclaimed. We would do well to remember that among the most indomitable of the revolutionists of 1776 were to be found the descendants of those who left Europe to seek in North America freedom to worship God in their own fashion. Our own view is that a forcible reverence and a forcible respect, extracted from young or old, is more harmful than beneficial, even to the acts demanded.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Although, for business reasons, not one of the 150 American newspapers above cited saw fit to mention the Jesuits as back of the sudden attempt to make the American people fall down before their own flag and worship it, yet every one of them knows that fact. Jehovah’s witnesses saw to it that the information was placed in their hands.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">How about the eventual showdown?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">The Jesuits fooled nobody when they opened their “S. J.” school against Communists in Philadelphia. How silly to teach thousands how to fight a movement that has but 90,000 voters in the United States! Coughlin’s “S. J.” school against Communists in Detroit is equally silly. Coughlin is now questioning if there will ever be another election in the United States. He probably thinks mere bluffing has risen to the point where uniformed gangsters and other members of a minority in the United States can take over all the public and private interests of 127,000,000 people merely because they tried it in Italy and Germany and got away with it. Results may be very different when this thing is tried in the good old U.S.A.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To be sure, it looks very bad at present, with the American Legion and other professional patriots, and with some shortsighted and incompetent editors on the side of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, but when the attempt is made, if it is made, to march on Washington and seize control of everything, then it will very likely be good-bye to the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To try to throw a scare into the rest of America </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic News,</span><span class="font8"> on its front page, January 18, 1936, carried a five-column scare headline “Holy Name Convention Here”, beneath which was the supposedly startling information: ‘Widespread Society’s Session in New York Next September 17-20; Convention, First in Twelve Years, Called at Invitation of Cardinal; Represents 2,500,000 Men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Examining this headline, the fear that the Hierarchy will make September 17-20 or thereabouts the date when it will undertake its proposed seizure of America and butchery of all Protestants is tempered somewhat by the news that this convention merely “represents” 2,500,000 men. Still, these “Holy Name” men are all armed police or firemen, and moving swiftly might easily duplicate what was done in Russia in 1917. In the states and provinces of Russia, in Europe and Asia, in 1932, there were 168,409,200 population, all held in rigorous control by 1,872,488 Bolsheviks, as of January 1, 1934. In other words, less than 1½ percent of the people in Russia have anything whatever to say about how they are governed. In America the group that confesses a determination to slaughter the Protestants as soon as strong enough is almost 20 percent of the population, and in virtual control of the army and navy, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font8"> the arms and ammunition, the public offices and the nation’s gold. What is to prevent it from going ahead with another St. Bartholomew's massacre? Nothing at all except the hand of Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The pretense that the Roman Hierarchy is afraid America will go Communist is just a bedtime story, to lull the American people to sleep until the pope gets ready to pull off his big act.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A five-minute talk</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE word </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">church</span><span class="font8"> is improperly applied to religious organizations which meet at some building and perform a formal ceremony. There are many such organizations amongst men. There is but one real church, and the members thereof in no regular earthly place. The true meaning of the term </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">church</span><span class="font8"> is, a body of Christians whom the Lord takes out from the world and uses to the honor of His name. The church is the creation of God, and the Head of that organization is Christ Jesus, as it is written in 1 Timothy 3:15: “The church of the living God.” That Christ is the Head, it is written, in Colossians 1:18: “[Christ Jesus] is the head of the body, the church.” At Hebrews 12: 23 it is stated that it is the “church of the firstborn” whose names are recorded in heaven. It follows, therefore, that man cannot create an organization which is the church, and that the recording of names on earthly books amounts to nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God has never tried to induce anyone to join His church. A creature becomes a member of the church only after he has voluntarily and fully devoted himself to God and has then proved his faithfulness and obedience to God. He must first do the will of God and receive His approval, and then God sets him in the church, as it is written in 1 Corinthians 12: ‘God sets the members in the body of the church as it pleases Him.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Has God organized the church and brought men into it merely for the purpose of taking them to heaven? Most emphatically no. God takes men out from the world to serve and obey Him, and He makes them members of His church and uses them in honor of His own name; and concerning this it is written, at Acts 15:14: “God at the first did visit the [nations] to take out of them a people for his name.” The Devil boasted that he could turn all men away from God. To prove the Devil a liar and that God is the only source of life, God favors man with the opportunity to prove his devotion and integrity toward the Lord; and that He does in vindication of His own name, and He uses such faithful ones to proclaim His name and His purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How does one become a member of the church? He first receives some knowledge that Jehovah is the true God and that Christ Jesus is the Savior of man. He believes these truths and shows his desire to be in harmony therewith by devoting himself to God and agreeing to do His will. Everyone who is made a member of the church must follow in the same way that Jesus went, because Jesus is the head and foundation of the church. It is written, at 1 Peter 2:21: “For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.” Christ Jesus declared himself wholly on the side of God. He devoted His life to telling God’s truth, and for this reason the Devil and his agents caused Jesus great suffering. All who have wholly devoted themselves to God and faithfully given testimony concerning Him and His kingdom have likewise been made to suffer much indignity and many persecutions at the hand of Satan and his agents. Such faithful followers of Christ Jesus are permitted to suffer in this manner in order that they may prove their faithfulness and integrity toward God. Having done this they are made members of the church, which is the body of Christ. They must be faithful to God under all conditions even unto death; and for this reason Jesus says to His followers: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee [the] crown of life.” (Revelation 2:10) The apostle Paul was a striking example of this truth, as is stated at 2 Timothy 4: 7, 8: “I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are not many persons who love the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ and His kingdom, but it is only those who do love Him and who have, under the test, proved their absolute devotion to God that will be made members of His church. To prove one’s love for God and His kingdom he must fight the good fight of faith; meaning that men must fully trust in God and His Word and refuse to compromise with those denying the Lord and His kingdom. The church, of which Christ Jesus is the Head, constitutes Jehovah’s organization to carry forward His purpose concerning the human race both now and in the future days. The eternal abiding place of the church is in heaven, and those who go to make up the church are the only men that will ever be changed into spirit creatures and be in heaven. While on the earth each one of these must prove his integrity toward God by faithfully and loyally doing the will of God in looking out for and safeguarding the interests of the Kingdom which the Lord has committed unto them. God has plainly marked out the duty and work of His faithful ones while on the earth, and has fully commissioned them to do that specific work.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>Jehovah’s witnesses in Fiji, New Zealand, New Jersey, New England, and the Rockies</span></h2>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font8">HEN I entered Suva Gaol [Jail] on a sentence of £25 or three months hard labor because I had been teaching people to honor God rather than man (the charge read, “action prejudicial to the peace and good order of the colony”), I was told that no distinction would be made in my case, that I was merely a prisoner and, as such, had no rights, as there was no favoritism in jail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now, while Indians, Fijians, Chinese and Europeans are accustomed to different food, they are all entitled to decent sleep, surely. But do they get it? No.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Europeans have a mosquito net, one blanket, one sheet, one pillow, and what I call a corrugated mattress, while we have electric light in the cells from 6: 00 to 8: 00 p.m., and at 5: 30 in the morning it is switched on for us to rise by, and it creates the illusion of warming the cell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The rest of our brothers have no mattress, no mosquito net, no sheet, no pillow, only the one blanket, and one empty gunny sack provided to soften bare boards, but which is rolled up generally and used as a pillow—the only alternative being the sweaty clothes discarded and used as a pillow. The whole place is alive with mosquitoes, and the only way for these poor chaps to dodge them is to roll up in the blanket and be half-smothered. No light in their cells, the light being outside in the corridor. Some of the Fijians are there because they did not pay their poll tax; but for whatever cause we were in jail, surely humanity suggests equal treatment as regards sleeping accommodation at least.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now the question arises in my mind, Do the Fijian chiefs and the leaders of the Indian community shut their eyes to these facts? Surely they have been told about it by their own people; the religious leaders of all sections know it, and the visiting magistrates know it; and as Suva Gaol, I understand, is run at a profit, derived from the work of the prisoners, there is no excuse for the hypocrisy of those who are responsible for the position created and of those who do know or whose job it is to know, but who do not alleviate the unnecessary sufferings of those unfortunates who happen to have a different color of skin, but have the same blood. I will not speak of the food given to these poor people, because, though it is a disgrace to all associated with the prison, inasmuch as there is such a difference between white and black, the authorities will say, of course, that these people are not used to European food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As far as I was concerned, I have no complaints to make as regards my treatment there. I have learned to put up with whatever comes along in the service, but I do not like petty spite, whether it is inflicted on myself or on others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And again, the only Catholic officer in the gaol was always courteous to me (though he does not hold with the Watch Tower publications), for, as he said, every man has the right to his own opinion, and also to the privilege of communicating that opinion or belief to others who may wish to hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For myself, I am not concerned with my hearers’ religion or race or caste, neither do his clothes or uniform signify to me. All are human creatures, with equal right to live and to enjoy the things Jehovah God has provided for mankind.—By H. Rice (Fiji).</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>From an Old-Timer in New Zealand</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Just a few words of appreciation of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font8"> I commenced to take it about 1920; practically my first part in the service was with No. 27. It was great to be in the thick of it. One of our people said it was like giving a man a smack on the head with a hammer and going back later to ask him how he liked it. That is, as far as “churchy” folk were concerned. By the way, I nearly had my neck broken in that work. Going out one Sunday to distribute, and just as I started off down hill on the cycle, my front forks collapsed; I landed on my head and neck on the tramtrack. A heavier man would have been killed, but my lightness and agility saved me. One of the first people I called on when “canvassing” was a preacher who made short work of me. I never got a word in. About a month after, the same man (a married man) was arrested for sexual offenses on a number of mentally weak women members of his congregation, was found guilty, and sentenced to seven or eight years’ hard labor. Concerning my accident, I sometimes wonder if the Devil had something to do with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Well, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> has kept coming all these years, and is always getting better; just rolls up every two weeks like an old friend that never lets you down. We have been through some trials together. What tricks we have learned from its pages: how to save on the coal bill, and the food bill; what to avoid, such as aluminum, drugs, etc.; and all the health hints, herbs, dieting, and so on!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Being a returned soldier my health started to go back, became “burned out” physically; the average man would land in a hospital and gradually decline; but through a steady use of herbs and watching the diet, and through chiropractic treatment as advocated by </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font8"> I have astonished doctors who examine me at pension time, because of general improvement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">However, the quantity of serum poison inocu-ulated during the war has told its tale, and I cannot now do much in Jehovah’s service; but I know He takes the will for the deed. Despite many difficulties, Sr. Mac and I have much joy in witnessing for Jehovah and hope soon to see His name completely vindicated and the wicked rule of Satan destroyed for ever. Meantime we ask you to keep it coming. And don’t forget, we daily remember you at the throne of grace. Now I meant to write only a few lines, but here I am making a story of it.—A. McD .</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark69"></a>Report on a Case at Verona, N. J.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">O</span><span class="font8">N January 9, William H. Zimmer was witnessing in the business section of Verona. Following is his statement of what happened:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I was working the business section of Verona. I went into a real estate office. I approached a man at his desk with the card, and he read it, asking me if I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses. I said “Yes”. Then in an excited tone of voice he said, “You better get out of town; if the Veterans of Foreign Wars know that you are in town they will lynch you. ’ ’ I received the card, saying to him, “I fear neither man or devil”; and he looked amazed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I continued and went into a tavern, approached the keeper, he stating he was not interested. Coming out I heard a voice, “I will read it”; so I presented the card to him. His voice began to rage, “You people are going around telling people not to salute the flag.” He began to use profane language against me, threatening to get hold of me and throw me out of the place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As I left the tavern I looked back and saw the man get into his car. Not paying any attention to it I started on the other side of the street and worked back. I was in a bootblack store and in came this party, who had threatened to throw me out of the tavern, saying to me, ‘ ‘ Come with me, I am going to take you to police headquarters. ’ ’ I paid no attention to him, as the bootblack was interested in what I was telling him. He interfered, saying I was going around telling people not to salute the flag and am not a citizen. The bootblack gave me a contribution of ten cents and accepted the booklets; the veteran (I found at police headquarters he is a veteran) said to the bootblack, “That’s ten cents more to down the American flag.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The veteran then said to me, “You are under arrest.” I asked him if he is a police officer. He said “Yes”. “Show me your authority,” I said to him. Then he said, “lam going to take you to police headquarters.” I ignored him, but still he insisted that I should go with him. I told him to go and leave me, as I had work to do. I continued on in my work, leaving for a tailor shop, where the party accepted a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Loyalty</span><span class="font7"> booklet. An officer then came with the veteran, asking me to come to police headquarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the police headquarters the chief asked for my permit. I presented the police card to him. The chief asked me to sit down, and went to the telephone and called up the recorder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He spoke kindly of us to the recorder, stating that there are cases also in Maplewood and Plainfield. The chief said, “If you are going around telling people not to salute the flag you should show them why they shouldn’t salute it.” He and the officer accepted </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Loyalty</span><span class="font7"> booklets, stating that they would read them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The recorder was a real judge. Was quite fair in his rulings as to admission of testimony. Halfway through the trial he asked a Mr. McKeown, an attorney in the courtroom, to cross-examine the witness Hessler. McKeown started out big; strutted around the floor with the very apparent intention of showing up Jehovah’s witnesses as being the most dangerous of anarchists. Hessler made a good witness, and McKeown finally subsided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the conclusion of the hearing, the court decided to take the matter under advisement for a week. Monday evening, January 20, the court rendered his decision. In it he said, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I have always kept my religious convictions out of my work as recorder, but I will tell you frankly that I am a Roman Catholic. I do not approve of the statements in the literature condemning Catholics and Protestants in general and holding up yourselves as being the only righteous ones. I am convinced that some of the statements in the booklets are libelous. But, it is evident that your work is a religious work, and comes under the exception stated in the ordinance. I therefore dismiss the ease.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">England division of Jehovah’s witnesses has been in operation since July 6, 1935. Up to October 13 it has made the circuit of the division, traveling a distance of 6,100 miles from the eastern border of New York state at White Plains to Keene, N. H., on the north and Stonington and Putnam, Conn., on the east. It has broadcast the recorded lectures of Judge Rutherford in 39 cities and 94 towns, giving several lectures in each place, totaling 367 meetings. It is estimated that approximately 89,000 persons have heard the message of Jehovah God’s kingdom under Christ by means of Brother Rutherford’s lectures over the horns of the sound car.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The operators of the sound car have been arrested and thrown into jail, photographed and fingerprinted, brought to trial, found guilty, and sentence suspended. The operators have twice been taken to police stations, the police attempting to stop the work. Seven times they have been approached by police officers. In witnessing from door to door we have found that many persons have expressed appreciation of the message. One person, not knowing whence the sound was coming, said to a neighbor, “We are getting a message from heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the other hand, the lectures are arousing the enemy to bitter hatred; calling up the police ; ordering us off their premises when calling with the message; cursing us; threatening violence ; etc. Three times the operators have met with mob violence, once threatening to dump car and all into the river.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A prominent sign, “Jehovah’s witnesses,” in bright colors, appears on each side of the car. It is observed that many persons read this sign and thus the name Jehovah comes before the minds of the people in this way as well as through the horns.—G. F. Thomson, Conn.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">AFTER discarding the aluminumware I continued to have constipation, but my stomach gradually improved until I could eat almost anything I wished, except apples and whole wheat in any form, except bread. If I ate a few apples they would put a sore on my lip; the more I ate of them, the bigger and sorer my lips would get. The whole wheat gave me heartburn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After going into the pioneer work and getting into the high and cold altitude I was determined for economy, and my health’s sake, to give the wheat another trial. To my surprise there was no bad effect. In a couple of weeks my constipation began to disappear, and was soon a thing of the past. This fall I have eaten lots of apples, and haven’t had any sores on my lips.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Near Deep Creek, Nevada, I saw an apple orchard which had never been sprayed, and the apples were not wormy. The good-hearted lady there gave me a sack of apples, three pounds of baby beef, a few tomatoes and some roasting ears, for a few books. I ate the roasting ears raw for dinner that day as I drove along. At night in a Ghost Mining town I traded three books for a bed. Too late for supper; so I had apples and tomatoes for supper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The next morning I was up before anyone else and on my way, drove 45 miles over the hills, gave my first testimony a little after seven o’clock to a Mormon woman, who said she “thought the Lord’s brethren spoken of in Matthew 25:35 could be any bum or hobo that you feed at your door”. I said, “So you people believe the Lord’s brethren are a bunch of bums and hobos?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I had apples for breakfast that day; and for dinner, had apples again. I drove 145 miles in the work that day, which was one of those in that short month of 22 days, wherein I placed 347 books and 445 booklets and two </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age </span><span class="font8">subscriptions, and a promise there would be a half dozen more.—S.

Germany is out of the League of Nations, Italy will soon be out of the League of Nations, and Austria, which lies between has refused to join in the embargo against Italy. Just a word now to such prominent members of the International Murderers, Limited, as make their homes in the United States. America has declared an embargo on war supplies. If the murderers wish to ship munitions to Italy they will have to do it via Germany. Of course, they all know all about this already. This is just to let them know that others know about it too. Fifty-one nations voted for “sanctions” against Italy, but Mussolini, Ratti and Hitler want Italy’s market for war supplies kept open. Now suppose the chief -est of the International Murderers wants to sell to Germany, as has been done right along, and Britain objects; what a beautiful situation is thereby created! Seems just like 1914, does it not? It is just possible that Roosevelt may keep America out of the war—as Woodrow Wilson did.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark116"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark117"></a>There Shall Be No More Death</span></h2>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE sublime promise that the time is coming when there shall be no more death is one of the many wonderful promises found in that wonderful book, the Bible. Some are disposed to say, “It is too good to be true,” but faith in God Jehovah replies, “It is too good not to be true.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Death is a great enemy of the human race. Some are reconciled to the thought of death because of sorrow, sickness or old age; but if these things did not take away from them the joy of living, none would wish to die. Death, therefore, is an enemy. (1 Corinthians 15: 26) It is not, as some profess to believe, the gateway to a more glorious life. True, the apostle Paul said that for him to die was gain, but this was true in his case because death would end for him the great “fight” in which he was engaged, and would be the seal of his faithfulness to Jehovah. Faithful unto death, he would await the crown of life. (Revelation 2:10) Hence Paul’s statement in Philippians (1: 21) does not contradict the consistent teaching of the Bible that death is the wages of sin, and not the passageway into another life.—Romans 6: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Death entered the world through the sin or disobedience of the first human creature placed upon the earth, Adam, who was the responsible head of the human family.—Romans 5:12,17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now let us note some of the many Scriptural passages which show that death is really death, and that those who die are in no sense alive. It appears strange that this should be necessary, but the chief enemy of God and man, Satan, has so beclouded the minds of the people on this subject that they prefer his lie to the simple and conclusive truth.—Genesis 3:4.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark118"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark119"></a>Death the Opposite of Life</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">What is death? As darkness is the absence of light, so death is the absence of life, and as white is the opposite of black, life is the opposite of death. The Bible places the two over against each other as opposites time and again. “The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life.”—Romans 6: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Speaking to Israel, Jehovah said, “I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil. ... I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life.” (Dent. 30:15,19) In Jeremiah (21:8) appears the warning, “Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death.” “In the way of righteousness is life; and in the pathway thereof there is no death.” (Proverbs 12: 28) In every instance death is shown to be the opposite of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This being clearly demonstrated, it is simple to know what death is. Life means consciousness. Death means unconsciousness. “There is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave.” (Ecclesiastes 9:10) “The living know that they shall die; but the dead know not any thing.” (Ecclesiastes 9: 5) Living persons have the power to feel, see, hear, taste and smell. The dead have not, for the organs by which they smell, taste, hear, see and feel are inactive.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark120"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark121"></a>“Dust Thou Art, to Dust Retumest”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Everyone will concede that this is true, but there are those who insist that this is not true of the “soul”. “It is true,” say they, “of the body only.” Such may even quote the words, “Dust thou art, to dust returnest, was not spoken of the soul.” However, this quotation is not Scripture, which asserts the contrary. “God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of [lives]; and man became a living soul.” (Genesis 2:7) Man </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font8"> a soul. Therefore, when God said to him, “Dust </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">thou</span><span class="font8"> art, and unto dust shalt </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">thou</span><span class="font8"> return,” it meant all of Adam, and not just part of him. Since man </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font8"> a soul, it follows that the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">soul</span><span class="font8"> is dead when man dies. “The soul that sinneth, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">it </span><span class="font8">shall die.” (Ezekiel 18:4) “[God] spared not their [the Egyptians’] soul[s] from death.”— Psalm 78:50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is because man does actually die and cease to think, feel, see, hear, taste or smell that the Bible speaks of death as a sleep.—Daniel 12:2; John 11:11; 1 Thessalonians 4:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hope for a future life is based upon the promise of a resurrection of the dead, and not upon the idea that there is something about a person that continues to live after death. This latter thought is nothing more nor less than believing Satan’s first lie. Jehovah had definitely stated that disobedience would result in death. Satan, the Devil, said, “Ye shall not surely die.” The entire heathen world, and the greater part of what is called the “Christian” world, believes this lie of Satan today.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark123"></a>The Dead Know Nothing</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">The wages of sin is not eternal torment, for an unconscious creature cannot feel torment. In view of the plain Bible assertion that “the dead</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">know not any thing” the doctrine of eternal torment is at once seen to be inconsistent and un-scriptural. The idea of eternal torment for the unbelieving came from the heathen teaching of the immortality of all souls, good and bad. “God is love,” and eternal torment of any creature could not be a demonstration of love, nor yet of justice. While it is admitted that there have been some very wicked people in the world, yet not any of them lived more than a thousand years, and an eternity of torture or torment would be punishment entirely out of proportion to the sins that might have been committed. The doctrine which consigns all, whether they have sinned much or little, to eternal torment if they fail to repent before they die is repugnant to justice. How absurd the idea that the words “God forgive me”, said before one dies, will blot out the wickedness of a lifetime, as in the case, for instance, of Dutch Schultz. Apparently this wicked thief had the matter well in mind that he would call for a Catholic priest toward the end of his life and thus settle the score.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Bible presents the matter quite differently. It shows that for every transgression there will be a just punishment, and that the punishment will be corrective as well as retributive. (Hebrews 2:2; Luke 12:47,48) A few symbolical passages of Scripture have been misapplied to support the doctrine of eternal torment, but the entire trend of the literal statements on the subject shows that such application of symbolical statements is entirely wrong. The Scripture states, “Yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be; yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.” (Psalm 37:10) This is quite a different thought from that advanced by Jonathan Edwards, who said that the righteous would look over the battlements of heaven and see the wicked writhing in the flames of hell. On the contrary, “The wicked shall perish.” (Psalm 37: 20) “Jehovah preserv-eth all them that love him; but all the wicked will he destroy.”—Psalm 145: 20, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark124"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark125"></a>Hell, Sheol, Hades</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">But the Bible does say that the wicked go to hell. More than that, it shows that the righteous have gone there also. All the members of the human race have, at death, gone to “hell”, but not to a place of torment. The word “hell” in the Bible means the condition of death. It is a translation of the Hebrew word </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">sheol</span><span class="font8"> and the Greek word </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">hades.</span><span class="font8"> Wherever these words are used they refer to the condition of unconsciousness in death, and not to suffering or torment. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Sheol </span><span class="font8">is the word used in Ecclesiastes 9:10: “There </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font8">no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in Sheol, whither thou goest.”—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If hell were a place of flaming fire and brimstone, Job would not have prayed to go there. But he did so pray, saying, “Oh that thou would-est hide me in Sheol, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me 1” (Job 14:13, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.) Job</span><span class="font8"> longed to die, because of his sufferings. He desired the unconsciousness and forgetfulness of death. Another godly man, Jacob, also fully expected to go to hell, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font8">not to eternal torment. He said, “If harm befall [Benjamin] . . . then will ye bring down </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">my </span><span class="font8">gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.” (Genesis 42:38, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font8"> In both cases here mentioned </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">word </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Sheol</span><span class="font8"> is used in the Hebrew, and so translated in the American Revised Version, but covered up in the King James Version by the use of the word “grave” for </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Sheol,</span><span class="font8"> though the Hebrew word for “grave” is an entirely different term. The use of the word </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Sheol</span><span class="font8"> in these passages shows that neither Job nor Jacob thought of hell as a place of torment. Besides, their words show that they did not expect to go to heaven, but looked for the resurrection, at which time, they understood, sin and death would end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Almost everyone in “Christendom” has heard it said of Jesus that “he descended into hell”. The clergy have tried to twist this to mean something else than the words clearly state. But the words mean just what they mean in the case of anyone else. Jesus </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">did go to</span><span class="font8"> hell when He died, but not to a place of torment. (Acts 2: 31) He really was dead, in hell, for three days. He himself said, “I am he that liveth, and was dead.”—Revelation 1:18.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark126"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark127"></a>Not Natural to Die</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">It is not natural for man to die. God created human creatures to live. His statement to Adam that disobedience would be punished with death implied that obedience would mean continued life. Failure to obey brought upon the first man created the sentence of death. His children have been brought into the world after the disobedience and have shared the penalty of death, though not under direct sentence. Imperfect and fallen parents could not bring perfect children into the world. “By one man sin entered into </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men.”—Romans 12: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This explains why good, bad, and indifferent all die. They do not die because of their own sins merely, but because of the fact that they belong to the fallen and imperfect, and therefore sinful, race.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark128"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup><a name="bookmark129"></a>u</sup>God So Loved the World”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">God purposed to recover men from the penal</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ty </span><span class="font8">of death. He said, “I will redeem them from death, I will ransom them from the power of the grave [Sheol].” (Hosea 13:14) Jesus Christ, the son of God, is the Redeemer and Ransomer of men. He gave His human life a corresponding price for Adam, and thus opened the way for mankind to be recovered from death and hell. Since all were condemned because of one man’s disobedience, all (or as many as will accept it and be obedient) may be redeemed and ransomed by one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Adam, before his transgression, was perfect and holy, undefiled and pure. Jesus, in order to be an acceptable ransomer, was also holy, harmless, undefiled and separate from sinners. Though born of a woman, </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">His</span><span class="font8"> life came from above. Jesus only, of all the human family, had a prehuman existence. He said, “I am </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">come</span><span class="font8"> that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.”—John 10:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jesus willingly gave himself as an acceptable sacrifice to God in order to redeem mankind. This does not mean, as some have said, that God is bloodthirsty and cruel and demands human sacrifice. Such a charge against the great Jehovah is blasphemous in the extreme, and the facts being so plainly stated in the Bible, those who make such assertions are highly culpable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God, in order to maintain the righteousness and unchangeableness of His laws, must exact the penalty for disobedience. He could not excuse or condone sin in Adam, nor in any of His creatures. He will not set aside a justly imposed sentence, but He did provide a way in which He might be just and yet justify the sinner, if repentant. (Romans 3:26) This is what He did through Christ. “God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”—John 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God’s gift of His beloved Son shows, not cruelty, but love, infinite love. By giving His life for the world Jesus opened the way for the resurrection of the dead. “Since by man came death, by man [Jesus] came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.” (1 Corinthians 15:21,22) This does not mean, however, that all, regardless of their own course of action, will be made alive. It means that all of the human family that shall gain everlasting life will be made alive in Christ, and in no other way. Further, this text shows conclusively that Jesus did not die to save people from a supposed place of fire and torment, but from death, the Bible hell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The blessings which Jesus purchased for all the willing and obedient have not yet been given to them. They will be given to men of good will in the kingdom of Christ, which is now “at the door”. Jesus will judge, rule over, the living and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom.— 2 Timothy 4:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He must rule until all enemies have been subjected to Him; and the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death, and then there shall be no more death. (1 Corinthians 15:25,26) But another work had to be accomplished before Jesus could begin to reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s name must be set right, vindicated before His creatures. Satan has long reproached that holy name, both by fostering wickedness and by misrepresenting God’s name and His loving purposes. He insisted that none of God’s creatures would willingly and unselfishly serve Him. (Job 1:1-2:10) This challenge God accepted, and purposed to select from among the nations a people who would magnify His name, and do so unselfishly.—Acts 15:14.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark130"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark131"></a>First to Be Raised</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">This class must be wholly devoted to and have complete faith in God. To them Jesus said, “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.” (Revelation 2:10) These are the first to be raised from the dead, and “on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years”.—Revelation 20: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some have supposed that these are the only ones to be saved. But God’s purpose is wider far. These will be used of Jehovah for the glory of His own name, and to bring salvation to mankind, by guiding them in the way of righteousness. These are the saints who with Christ shall judge the world. (1 Corinthians 6: 2) ‘When the judgments of the Lord are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.’ —Isaiah 26:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s judgments are for the purpose of teaching the people righteousness. This shows that these are not those who were previously footstep followers of Christ. Not only the living [quick], but also the dead, will share the benefits of these judgments. (2 Timothy 4:1) ‘All that are in the graves shall come forth: they that have (already) done good, to a resurrection of life; they that have done evil (the unjust), to a resurrection of (or by) judgment.’—John 5:28,29, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The purpose of the judgment is that all who will may learn righteousness and share in the resurrection blessings. Those who have already been approved will receive the right to life at once, while others will have to “learn” and, if obedient, will be approved and given life.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark132"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark133"></a>Coming Forth Not Resurrection</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">The ‘coming forth’, it will be noted, is not the resurrection. It is only the first step, preliminary to a resurrection. “Resurrection” means a re-standing, a full standing up to life in harmony with God; a complete regaining of the standing of righteousness. The majority of the human family will come forth unto resurrection by means of judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Those that come forth unto resurrection of life are not so numerous. It applies to those who have learned righteousness before the thousandyear reign of Christ begins. They will not require the corrective judgments of the thousand years, but are to administer those judgments, rulings, disciplines, under the direction of the great King of kings and Lord of lords, Christ Jesus.—1 Corinthians 6:2; Revelation 20:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another class that will come forth “unto life” will be the faithful servants of God who lived before Christ. These are mentioned in Hebrews, chapter 11, in Isaiah 32:1, in Psalm 45:16, and other places. These “fathers” become the children of Christ and the church, and are made princes in all the earth to rule in justice, having been rewarded with a “better resurrection” than that which will be accorded the remainder of the human race.—Hebrews 11:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">However, the day of judgment is not merely for the instructing of the people, but also for the perdition of ungodly men, as is shown by reference to 2 Peter 3: 7,8. This period of time will begin with Armageddon, in which the opposers of God’s righteous rule will be taken out of the way. Then, as the reign of justice progresses, the persistent sinners will “die accursed”, after having been given an opportunity to mend their ways.—Isaiah 65: 20.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark134"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark135"></a>The Last Enemy Destroyed.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">A thousand years may seem a long time to devote to the work of mankind’s regeneration. But when we consider the immense amount of work that must be accomplished, involving not only the millions now living, but also the billions of dead, it can be readily appreciated that a thousand years will not be too long. It is at the end of this period that the words “there shall be no more death” apply. It is then that “the last enemy” shall be destroyed, cast into the “lake of fire”, which pictures the utter destruction of whatever is cast into it. Then the work of redemption and regeneration will be complete. Those who declined to accept the gracious provision of God for their recovery, or who sought selfish advantage, will have been destroyed. The wicked shall not be. The righteous will have been wholly delivered from death. “Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.” (Luke 20: 36) Every tear will have been wiped away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“There shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.” —Revelation 21:4.</span></p>

Then he went on to say, “We desire the aspirations, needs and exigencies of our dear peoples should be satisfied, but with justice and peace.” What he meant was that he hopes and expects Mussolini to get Ethiopia. He should accomplish this theft with justice and peace, but if Haile Selassie will not give up without a fight, then it will be all right to use the brass knuckles.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HERE is a new scheme on how to pay your debts, or, rather, there are four of them, all in one: either “Annual”, which means to part •with $1 at once; or “Life”, which means to pay either $5 at once or $1 down and $1 a month for four more months; or “Perpetual”, which means to pay either $10 at once or $1 down and $1 a month for nine more months; or “Family”, which means to pay either $25 at once or $1 down and $1 a month for two years,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The money is to go to “Reverend” Joseph F. Stedman, director, Confraternity of the Precious Blood, at the monastery, 5300 Fort Hamilton Parkway, Brooklyn, N.Y. The only thing that needs to be looked into is the little detail of just how the money gets from “Reverend” Stedman to your creditors. The advertising matter is not quite clear on that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It seems there are various things that the money goes for, because on the back of the order blank, whereon you express your willingness to sign up on the “Annual”, the “Life”, the “Perpetual” or the “Family” plan, and to part with your $1, $5, $10, or $25, you also tell how the money is to be applied. It all looks very simple and easy to understand—if one is easily fooled.</span></p>

The eleven choices are, respectively, for employment, “to pay my debts,” for health, for family happiness, for souls in “purgatory”, for the sick, for vocation, for happy marriage, for grace to overcome, for conversion, and in thanksgiving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Here is the way its works. Suppose you are out of a job, and in need of employment. You have $25 left from your previous wages. The idea is that you send “Reverend” Stedman the $25 and then sit down quietly and wait for the job to come to you. Maybe he will take that same $25 and use it “to pay my debts”, or for his health, or for his happiness, or he may convert it into something, or he may just accept it in thanksgiving. Not quite clear on these points; better look into them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Or maybe you want to pay your debts and you have just $25 that will liquidate them. You either send Stedman the money and wait for him to pay the debts or you take the $25 and pay them yourself and tell him to wait.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">“Do you sincerely desire to be rich and very happy ? If so, a knowledge of how to gain riches and how to enjoy the same is of the greatest importance to you. If you are kept in ignorance of the true way and permit yourself to rely upon and be guided by the opinion of imperfect man, you can never gain the riches that will bring you peace and lasting happiness. Every person who will learn the right way, and who will then continue diligently to follow that right way, is absolutely certain in time to possess great riches and all attending blessings. The right way is not to be found in human schemes. He who would be truly rich must earnestly seek to gain a knowledge of JEHOVAH GOD and his great treasure house.”</span></p>
