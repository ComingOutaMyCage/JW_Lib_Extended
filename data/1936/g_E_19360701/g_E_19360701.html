<p><span class="font10">Shed a few tears, heave a heavy sigh, because a Roman Catholic priest says that 70 percent of Americans profess no religion and refuse to tip their hats or kiss the foot of any slimy Jesuit in lace pants. More than that, they refuse to acknowledge that any ecclesiastical bohunk in cute boudoir costumes embroidered in gold is the cream par-excellence of piety, unselfishness and love.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>The Communist Bugaboo</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">According to their own statements, the alleged 20,000,000 Roman Catholics of the United States are terribly frightened over the activities of considerably less than one percent as many Communists. They not only have started special S. J. anti-Communist schools in Philadelphia and Detroit, but allege that 100,000 Catholic students in 15 Catholic universities in the Middle West are likewise pursuing antiCommunist studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The simple will wonder what it is about Communist political ideas that has so frightened the Hierarchy. The thing is all a colossal humbug. What the Hierarchy seeks is some means of stopping the work of Jehovah’s witnesses, who have no more to do with Communism than with the Roman Camorra itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Hearst bugaboo is pure propaganda, intended to make Fascism at Jesuit hands popular and palatable when the trap is sprung. Coughlin’s S. J. will be an S. J. organization, without a doubt. And S. J. means J esuit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Stalin, Russian dictator, was educated to be a priest, probably a Greek Catholic one, and when his second wife died he had her buried in consecrated ground of a Moscow convent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In an address at Cincinnati by the Jesuit Daniel A. Lord, S. J. of St. Louis, Mo., after praising both cultures, Communism and Roman Catholicism, and admitting that they had much in common, as illustrated by the Jesuit “reductions” in Paraguay, and their views as to property, frankly admitted that both systems “are in favor of world revolution” and “if anything, the Catholic is more the revolutionist”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The admissions of Catholic spokesmen that they intend to gain world control and to accompany it by the destruction of all real protestants should be heeded. These men mean what they say in this connection. All counterbalancing claims that they are patriots and interested in democracy are pure moonshine.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>“Both Ends Against the Middle”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">At the Jesuit University of St. Louis one of the clever teachers ridiculed the United States Constitution, as did also the Catholic periodical misnamed </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">America.</span><span class="font10"> But what is this? Oh, it is just the Reverend E. J. Higgins, chaplain of the Catholic war veterans, broadcasting a letter to President Roosevelt over WLWL. And what does Mr. Higgins say? Oh, first he mentions that Pope Pius XI is the “real ‘forgotten man’ in the drama of nations”, and then he tells Mr. Roosevelt that “in opening the treasure vaults of Uncle Sam (!), you killed Communism with one stroke here in America”, and then, and then, “Catholic veterans are ready to a man to defend the Constitution” which the Jesuit priest of St. Louis, the pope, the president and many others detest and hate and are trying to change so that its framers would not know it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is a wonderful world. First, the president tells Congress to go ahead with legislation whether or not it is constitutional. When the Supreme Court ditches some of it he sneers at the decision. In St. Louis a ‘high and mighty’ Jesuit also sneers at it. And then Patrick Cardinal Hayes in an appeal to Catholics said: “There is not one person under the dome of this cathedral who would refuse to lay down his life” in defense of the Constitution—the same one the president swore to uphold. “You pays your money and you takes your choice.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At a meeting of Legionnaires in Philadelphia, Michael J. Kano, of Aliquippa, proposed Legionnaires carry ball cartridges in their rifles and “shoot a few Communists in the eye” if they needed to. And then the League Against War and Fascism wants Margiotti, attorney general of Pennsylvania, to start action against his fellow Catholic and fellow Fascist. But why expect Margiotti to be as bold against the priests as he was against the little folks at Canonsburg, deprived of their educational rights because they refused to place any object above their devotion to Jehovah God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, having devoted all their abilities to keeping the common people, their so-called “children of the church”, in ignorance, seem now to be really distressed because in Central America many of their subjects are turning to Communism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The countries there are being plastered with posters showing pictures of the bishops and archbishops of Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama urging the people not to have anything to do with Communism. This is probably like locking the stable door when the last faint clatter of the horse’s hoofs is dying in the distance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font10"> No. 429, page 323, in footnote said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jesuits Caught with the Goods. American radio listeners and newspaper readers, February 12, 1936, were greatly interested in the news from Germany that 150 priests and others had been arrested, caught with possessing and distributing Communist literature. It is perfectly apparent that the Communist scare in America is of Jesuit manufacture. The attempt, in both countries, is to secure absolute Papal control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It took only 73 days to straighten out this little snarl between Mr. Hitler’ and the Vatican, and the papers of April 25 said that on that day amnesty was granted to these offenders. The reason for the amnesty was said to be due to the fact that more votes against Hitler were to be found in the districts where the priests had been indicted as Communists than in communities where such action had not been taken, and it was thought the amnesty would remove any cause of friction with the Vatican.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One has to hand it to the Jesuits for clever work in dodging blame and throwing it upon other people, even if they do occasionally get caught. Protestant ministers in Germany, at about the time the 150 priests were caught possessing large quantities of Communist literature, suddenly discovered that they were receiving great quantities of such literature through the mails. In other words, the Jesuits were pouring out their stuff into Protestant hands in hopes that the Protestants would be caught with it and thus get into trouble. In this instance the Protestants were too clever for them. They compared notes, saw what was going on, and adopted the plan of opening all suspicious mail in the presence of the postmen.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>Political Rackets</span></h2>
<div><img src="g_E_19360701_files/g_E_19360701-3.png" alt="" style="width:230pt;height:262pt;">
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Mother of Racketeers</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">The percentage of Catholics in the United States, counting babies and all, is estimated at less than 16 percent. It is therefore of interest that figures published by </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Fellowship Forum</span><span class="font10"> in their issue of March 15, 1936, show that 31 percent of the employees of the Department of State are Catholics, 33 percent of the Geological Survey, 39 percent of the Land Office, 41 percent of the Department of the Interior and of the Department of Pensions, 43 percent of the Treasury Department, 53 percent of the War Department, 54 percent of the Patent Office, 60 percent of the Bureau of Education, 89 percent of the U.S. Shipping Board, 90 percent of the Department of Justice and of the National Park Service, 92 percent of the Government Printing Office, 93 percent of Indian Affairs, and 100 percent of the Alaskan Railroad. Also, that in the U.S. Soldiers Home in Washington all nurses are nuns, no Protestants being allowed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Last fall the WPA in South Dakota required all previously registered workers to re-register and reveal his or her religious creed. No matter what may be the ostensible object of this rule, the real object is to make sure, when the final showdown conies, that only Roman Catholics shall have a full stomach. There could be no other motive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In an address to 5,000 police at the eighteenth annual communion breakfast of the Holy Name Society of the Police Department, at the Hotel Astor in New York city on March 29,1936, Governor Curley, backed by Coughlin to be the next U.S. senator from Massachusetts, described himself as the only Catholic governor in the whole United States.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>“Massachusetts—There She Stands”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">What it will mean all over' the country when the Roman Hierarchy has everything in its grasp as fully as it has in Massachusetts can be judged from some of the expenditures of the Curley Roman Fascist administration: $35 for a lamp shade for the governor’s office; $85 for a radio set for his car; $88.68 for quill pens; $103 for a pen desk set; $114 for velvet curtains; $280 for vase and candlesticks; $337 for cigars for the governor’s office; $353 for chairs for the governor’s office; $442 for trip to Saratoga by Col. Hanken; $580.14 expense at Mayflower Hotel, Washington; $834 for meals for advisory council at the Ritz Carlton; $886 for leather-bound copies of the governor’s inaugural address, for gifts; $904.83 for desk and chairs for the lieutenant governor’s office; $1,300 to charter S. S. Romans for Cape Cod inspection; $1,672.50 for brochures of the State House, for gifts; $1,811.63 for expenses for Edmond Hoy on official duty to Washington, New York, Hartford and Bridgeport; $1,877 for expenses at Mayflower Hotel, Washington; $2,045 for meals at Parker House for Executive Department; $2,100 for Richard D. Grant for fares and meals for the governor and his party; $2,300 for flowers; $3,972 for traveling expenses for Lieut. Gov. Hurley; and $4,197.15 for taxicab fares for governor's office. All who think the $26,317.33 contained less than $20,000 of pure graft, signify it by saluting the papal flag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Fascist Massachusetts does love the automobile. Every time any of Gov. Curley’s official family goes anywhere it is by auto. Thus, the railway fare to Springfield and return the same day is $4.50, but when the governor’s secretary made the trip he went by taxicab at an expense to the state of $36. The charge for going two blocks in Boston was $1. The lieutenant governor charged the state $394.80 for the use of his own machine for one single month, and averaged well over $300 per month regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Once the Hierarchy gets its tools into office, where they can get their hands on the people's money, it is surely a cause for great happiness in the headquarters of the prince of this world to see how they can make the money fly. In the bills for thousands of dollars for taxi fares one bill of $12 was for transportation of a friend of the governor to and from a wedding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The State of Massachusetts is tied hand and foot by Roman Catholic politicians. Practically every person endorsing the State Teachers’ Oath Law is a Dorgan, a Walsh, a Reardon, or some similar name, while the most intelligent people in the state, virtually all the college presidents, the editors and other thinkers, desired the law repealed, but all in vain. Rome has the state by the throat.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Mexico Slipping</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">An article in the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font10"> accredits Patrick J. Scanlon, managing editor of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Tablet,</span><span class="font10"> as interested in the promotion of a Roman Catholic boycott of Mexican goods. The attempt, of course, was one of many the Roman Hierarchy has made, through various channels, to regain its lost power in Mexico, and there is some reason to believe that when President Cardenas exiled ex-President Calles it was a first step toward surrender to the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">According to Mexican laws, only 25 priests may legally seive in the 115 churches in Mexico city. Actually, however, more than that number serve, without interference by the government. Eighteen of the churches have been taken over for use as schools or libraries, inasmuch as they are government property and not needed for the purpose for which they were built.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Democratic politicians of Cincinnati who thought they could always count on the Roman Catholic vote received a shock when 18,000 letters were issued by Reverend William J. Anthony, of St. Peter's Cathedral, urging votes for two Republicans because the latter had voted in favor of the Roman parochial school bill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A dispatch from Madrid, Spain, states that the reason why Alcala Zamora, “father of the second republic,” lost his job as president was that the duly elected members of the parliament no longer trusted him because he is a Catholic.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>The Capture of New York City</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">As one comes into New York harbor the first thing he sees is a gigantic cross in green electric lights atop one of the skyscrapers; it seems to suggest to him that he is approaching a Catholic city. When he goes to the new post office to get his mail he finds it directly opposite St. Peter’s church, and in the heart of the district devoted to the selling of holy junk of all kinds forbidden in the Scriptures. When he goes to the new city hall he finds it built around St. Andrew's church, as if that were part of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The busiest place in New York is Times Square; in many respects the busiest place on earth. Now it seems that the Park Department will erect a monument there, to cover a site 27 feet by 24 feet, in honor of Francis P. Duffy, Roman Catholic chaplain of the 165th Infantry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The reason for cluttering up the city is perfectly plain. It is to get the Roman Catholic idea more firmly implanted in the public mind; that nobody is anything and the country is nothing unless trailing along behind the papal kite. Wait until the tail breaks loose, and then see what happens to both the kite and the tail. You might as well laugh; it is surely coming. Jehovah's kingdom will correct it all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Every government job in New York now has the “Holy Name Society&quot; tag. The last one was the Holy Name Society of the New York Post Office. First the society goes and has “mass” in St. Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth avenue and then marches through the heart of New York to the Hotel Astor, “led by their spiritual adviser.” The object of it all is to get as much space as possible in the papers and bluff the other employees to a standstill. And it works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The public, is sick to death of the Roman Hierarchy publicity stunts, but continues nevertheless to be fed more and ever more, with the Protestants feebly aping them. At hand is upward of a column in the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font10"> telling of some more of these breakfasts by the “United States Custom House Holy Name Society”, the “Brooklyn Post Office Holy Name Society”, “Department of Sanitation Holy Name Society,” etc., etc., </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">ad nauseam,</span><span class="font10"> the object of which is to try to bluff the public and all Protestant government employees into thinking that they must turn Catholic or else—.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In Australia the thing went so far that when one of the so-called “eucharistie” publicity stunts was pulled off, they even had the city’s harlots lined up to attend the show. Maybe that will come next in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At one of these fandangoes the Reverend Thomas J. Higgins, boasting of the great things Catholics have done since St. Bartholomew’s Massacre, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A few weeks ago a motion picture came out portraying the life and work of Louis Pasteur, whom the world had almost forgotten as one of the most intense Catholics that ever lived. Every day we are dependent on his achievements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Here is one for Mr. Higgins. The Pasteur treatment should be judged by its works. From 1922 to 1932 there were 15 cases of human rabies at the Los Angeles county hospital; all were given the Pasteur treatment, and every one of the 15 died; and this is the usual result. It is denied that the treatment is of any value at all.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>Red Mass Racket</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">As in New York, so in Australia, the Roman Hierarchy is working the Red Mass racket to a finish. Beginning last year, the attempt is made to make it appear- that the legal profession is in some way identified with the doctrine of the mass, and Jews and Protestants as well as Catholics are sought to add to the numbers present, so as to make as big a report in the papers as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At Brisbane, at the Red Mass starting off the legal year, oh, how glad the newspapers were to tell about the “impressive and colorful ceremony”, the “robes of scarlet and ermine”, the “full-bottomed wigs”, the “barristers in wigs and gowns”, and the “members of the land police, magistrates, industrial magistrates and coronial courts’ benches”, and so forth </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">ad infinitum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Everywhere, in every public place, the Roman Hierarchy is sticking its nose into everything. The obvious intent is to make it appear that in some way everything on earth that amounts to anything is officially or unofficially connected with the Roman Hierarchy. Just why the Hierarchy should wish to appear to be the mainstay of the legal profession, when its own ecclesiastical law books openly teach its followers to commit perjury, theft and murder, is one of life’s curious oddities soon to be disposed of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At the meeting of the Farleyized, Roman-Catholicized Western Pennsylvania Postmasters’ Association, held, for some reason, in St. Joseph’s parochial school hall, at Tarentum, Pa., the spokesman, Reverend Father Dennis Haggerty said that some modern literature is dressed up to make a fine appearance but it is really very dangerous. He suggested that postmasters might be able to warn the recipients against such literature when they see it in his mails. Thanks awfully, Mr. Haggerty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And now the next time some postmaster with the map of Ireland spread all over his face, and a string of beads around his neck, and a pocketful of holy junk, tells you, 0 ye subscribers, not to read </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font10"> any longer, you can cheerfully explain to him that while there is some fine discrimination in the Scriptures between sheol, hades, gehenna and tartarus, yet, as far as you are concerned, it is quite immaterial to you which destination he selects, as long as he does, with reasonable efficiency, the job for which you are paying his wages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Also, you can explain to him that when you want any assistance from Farley or from him as to what you shall read, you will send for him, and until you do send for him he shall be careful henceforth to keep his advice to himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Oh, by the way; the next paragraph in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Valley Daily News,</span><span class="font10"> of Tarentum, goes on to say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">James J. McNany, postmaster at Du Bois, lauded the efficiency of the Post Office Department and heaped praise upon Postmaster General James J. Farley for ,be contributions he made to this condition. He referred to Farley, who is also national chairman of the Democratic party, as a “master mind”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Ever hear of Boss Tweed, one-time Big Shot of Tammany Hall, in New York city? He was a master mind, too. All you have to do is to wait.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Patronage Racket</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">Roosevelt made Farley Postmaster General so that Civil Service in the Post Office Department might be wrecked. He knew Farley would do the job, and he did. In 1933 out of 3,369 presidential postmasters confirmed by the senate only 25 were postal employees advanced from the ranks. Now that these offices have been largely filled with politicians who can do little more than read and write their own names, there is a sudden spasm for “Civil Service”, all for political effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Under the Wilson administration, in the days of the World War, in a single year, 315,533 positions in the Federal executive service were tilled, all by Civil Service rules and practices. The United States Government had not at that time sold out to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the present administration there has been no world war, yet 235,000 persons were added to the direct full-time pay roll of the Federal government but only one in 107 among the new personnel is under Civil Service. During the first 21 months of Mr. Roosevelt’s administration he signed bills exempting 41,400 new jobs from Civil Service administration, and transferred 2,448 classified positions from the Civil Service to the appointive lists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Six weeks before Roosevelt was inaugurated, a book, sarcastically called the ‘‘Plum Book”, was wriggled through the Senate and the Government printing office, cataloguing 33,600 jobs, then held by experienced workers, that would at once be given to Democratic politicians. Tn years to come it will be seen that when the United States government was wrecked it was wrecked from the inside.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">In their “Merry-Go-Round” of Washington politics Drew Pearson and Robert S. Allen made the following statement of Roosevelt's ineffectual attempt to put the Roman Hierarchy in possession of information they had no business to have. They said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One instance which peeved the president particularly occurred with the chief code expert of the War Department. He has charge of putting messages into secret cipher before cabling them abroad. Roosevelt has a cousin, a Catholic clergyman, who wanted certain information. So the president gave him a personal note to the chief code expert, asking that he make the information available. The code expert refused. The relative went back to the president, who became considerably irked, and wrote a second note to the code expert. But again the code expert refused to supply the desired information. ‘'There are some things,” he said, “which I cannot divulge even to the president.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The people who are howling down communism and shouting up Mussolini and Hitler in the United States are the same sort who financed and helped organize Mussolini and Hitler, and they are using the same stooge—Bolshevism. . . . And not enough Americans actually realize what a low and villainous lot of murderers they were, what evil mediocrities and neighborhood ne’er-do-wells, what deadbeats, chippy-chasing street-corner roues and bums who made up the original bands of patriots in Italy and Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Pegler is just back from a trip that took him all over Europe. He took a close look at first hand both at Fascism (Catholic Action) in Italy and Nazism (Catholic Action) in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Associated Press contains a dispatch from Rome saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Persons close to the Catholic church say Mussolini draws most of his inspiration in religious matters from a simple Jesuit priest, Father Tacchi-Venturi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Did you notice how that word “simple” was worked in?</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Rejoicing in Murder</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">The papers of May 7,1936, contain a half-page picture of a “priest performing the Catholic rites” in front of a row of machine gunners. The headline sets it out as, “Mussolini’s devout soldiers receive the blessing of the church.” Why not ? The “church” has always stood for murder and is never so happy as when engaged in it in one form or another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The hypocrite in skirts in front of the machine gunners has a broad grin on his face. Why, sure! What else would lie have ? Would he have any look of sorrow to think of the human creatures that would be riddled by those machine guns ? Not he. It would be a real joy to see anybody suffering the “tortures of the damned” if he thought the Hierarchy could by any means make a nickel out of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Fifteen hundred German pilgrims to the pope had the right idea. They &quot;Heil Hitler’ed before they left for Rome, and when they left the pope they cried three times &quot;Heil Papst”. It is all in the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One by one the cardinals are lining up for Hitler, and soon the pretense that there was ever any real friction between the pope and der Fuehrer will be discarded as useless baggage. Cardinal .Schulte, Roman Catholic archbishop of Cologne, telegraphed a hearty welcome to the German war department when it sent troops to the left bank of the Rhine.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">If the Hierarchy wants to make a saint out of somebody, why doesn't it pay its own bills for such little items as disinterment and transportation ? Why mix two governments up in something that is none of their concern ? Father Damien had lain in his grave 59 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The removal of his body from the Molokai (Hawaii) leper colony caused quite a flurry. The body was disinterred “at the request of the king of the Belgians'’ and rushed to Panama by United States army planes and the United States cruiser Republic, when it was taken to Belgium, where, after the usual fuss and feathers, it will be made into a Roman Catholic “saint&quot;’. Father Damien died of leprosy, but the faithful will kiss his bones gratefully, if he is made a “saint”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The disinterment revived old charges that Damien, instead of being a saint, had died because he consorted with women lepers, so contracting the disease. He was said to be narrowminded, bigoted, and dirty of body, despite the statement in Young and Field </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">School Reader, </span><span class="font10">Book 6, “And the soul of Father Damien ascended like a dove unto heaven, unto the one who gave it.&quot;</span></p>

If not, why all the anxiety to have boy policemen who are only Roman Catholics? Boy Scouts are non-sectarian. So were the movies, so were the newspapers, so were the schools, so was the radio, so was everything else, until Rome stepped in and grabbed it all. Here is a headline that Boy Scouts from 75 troops marched into St. Patrick’s Cathedral on such and such a date. Pretty soon they will be called the Holy Name Boy Scouts, along with Holy Name policemen, Holy Name mail carriers, Holy Name customs officers, Holy Name this, and Holy Name that, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">ad nauseam.</span><span class="font10"> The account said, “Carried ahead of the troop banners were the Papal flag and the American flag!’’</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Eager, always, to show their enthusiasm for murder, no matter what form it takes, the archbishop of Taranto, Italy, performed mass in an Italian submarine, submerged to a depth of 900 feet. It was relayed by radio throughout Italy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Thanks to the persistence with which it has been pursued during the last twelve years, the “Catholic Action” movement has gradually spread throughout the Catholic world. In all countries in which they represent a real force, Catholics arc now organized on the initiative and under the direction of their bishops into big national federations, which in turn are divided into diocesan federations, grouping men, women, boys and girls in uniform associations. The perfecting of this organization represents the most important attempt made by the clergy for some time to organize the faithful with a view to action.—Hartford (Conn.) </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Transcript.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For burying their dead fourteen Greek Catholic women of the Dodecanese islands, in the Aegean sea, were sentenced to three months’ imprisonment and 800 liras fines. The Italian government, still maintaining control over the islands (contrary to its sworn promises), asserts that burial certificates must be issued by the Roman Catholic church, which the Greek population denies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Greek paper </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Dodecanesios,</span><span class="font10"> published in New York city, asserts that in suppressing the Greek population of these islands the Italians have been guilty of starving prisoners, brutally beating them, depriving them of sleep, and pulling out their nails with pincers. They name D. Fantenou, P. Kefalan, J. Prosfigan and D. Bolan of the island of Rhodes as persons upon whom these terrible outrages were performed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At San Juan, Puerto Rico, the blackshirted Cadets of the Republic, after denouncing Uncle Sam as an international bully, engaged in operating the despotism of plutocracy, marched to the cathedral for a blessing upon their acts. They entered the cathedral flying a black flag with a white cross. They knew where to go for their blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At Vai Alain, Quebec, the village priest, Abbe Belanger, advised his “flock” to tar and feather a man in the community. They did so, and five of them were arrested and brought to Quebec city. Though they were brought before a Catholic judge, and with the priest (not arrested) pleading for them, the judge nevertheless proved to be to some extent an honorable and courageous man and sentenced all five to two months in prison. Apparently the priest, however, the instigator of the crime, was allowed to go entirely free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is still some liberty in Canada, in spite of Roman Catholic boasts that the church is “mistress of all public institutions in Quebec” and will soon be (according to Cardinal Villeneuve) “mistress of all public institutions in Canada ”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Judge Noel Belleau, a mere tool of the Hierarchy in Quebec, fined G. C. Barrett (of Belleville, Ontario) and G. H. Brodie (of Toronto) $300 each and sentenced them to two months each in prison for circulating in Quebec literature showing that God’s kingdom, and not the Roman Hierarchy, is the hope of the world. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, where the conviction was quashed, and the Appeal Court of Quebec received a richly merited rebuke for its act of cowardice in sustaining Belleau in his findings for the Roman Hierarchy and against the Watch Tower.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>Business Rackets</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">At hand a circular letter put out by a priest in Arizona. It is the greatest mixture of masses, hens, and real estate ever concocted. One of the real estate propositions is near a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age </span><span class="font10">subscriber's home, who says of it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This half section, one mile south of here, could not be sold today for $1500; there is not one drop of water on it; the party who lives on it has to haul his water two miles for house use and stock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now see the picture the priest paints:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Half section farm one mile from Ipswich. Perfect land. Rich black loam. Water in pasture. 280 under plow. Fair buildings. Suitable for those seven productions (poultry, fruit, pigeons, capons, honey, alfalfa, dairy). Can be made to yield $16,000 a year. Price $24,225. $225 cash down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In his circular letter the priest indicates his willingness to sell masses, rosaries, books and real estate, and tells of his profits in the following lurid language:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Alfalfa brings $60 per acre. My plums and strawberries $500 per acre each. My hens $4.39. A young man with $400 to start is now worth $65,000. Two girls dropped $400 a month teaching, now make $10,000 a year. A widow with five small children and $600 to start makes $4,000 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Probably if you saw this priest you would note the seat of his pants is out (if he wears pants) and they are fringed at the bottom like a portiere, and his shoes dropping off his feet. These priests have been at the business of lying for so long that it does not seem to occur to them that there is a limit to human gullibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Edward Laurence Doheny, knight of the black satchel (in which the bribe money was carried), is dead. Worth $100,000,000, he was declared innocent of giving to a U.S. Government official the $100,000 bribe which Albert Fall was found guilty of accepting!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At his funeral the Most Reverend John J. Cantwell, assisted by Most Reverend Francis Kelly, and Right Reverend J. Cawley, helped everybody to see that Doheny “rose, without benefit of social position, but by a brilliant intelligence, rugged constitution and undying faith, to become one of the leading men of his time’’. Nothing was said about the black satchel or the $100,000 bribe of Fall.</span></p>

After two and one-half years absorbing Jesuit ideas they get jobs in factories, workshops, etc., wearing no religious habit, and are thus able to collect job and graft information more readily than if their identity were known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Every time the child labor amendment is up in New York state or Massachusetts, it is always noticed that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is against the children and the amendment is defeated. This got on the nerves of the Massachusetts representative of the American Federation of Labor, Robert J. Watt, secretary, and he tried to find out from the so-called “apostolic delegate” “whether the child labor amendment may not be considered a matter of economic and social legislation on which Catholic priests, laymen and legislators may speak and vote according to their individual judgment as citizens of the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Good idea. How would it do to send a committee to call on the pope himself to find out, if he gets full charge of the United States, just what subjects can be discussed openly in the United States, anyway ? The whole list could be put on the back of one of Mr. Farley’s postage stamps.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">In the restoration of five old Spanish missions near San Antonio, Texas, the work is being done by relief labor. Benevolent Uncle Sam! It would be interesting to know how many Protestants are being employed in the restoration of these Roman Catholic missions; also how many Protestant buildings are being restored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Very Reverend Father John Power, P.P. K.C.H.S., Parkfield Road, Saltley, Birmingham 8, England, wanted £36,000 to build parochial schools. His bid for it, in the advertising literature just at hand, is that for nine successive days he intended to say mass at the following places in rotation: at the tomb of the Lord; at Calvary; at Joseph’s house in Nazareth (didn’t the angels carry this to Loretto, Italy?); at the place where Jesus was nailed to the “cross”; at the place where He was scourged; at the place where He was crowned with thorns; in the garden of Gethsemane; in the stable where Jesus was born; and at the place where the annunciation was made to the virgin Mary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For a little more he would be willing to say mass at the identical spot where each and every event and item of Biblical history occurred. Wonder what he would charge for a mass said on the spot where Balaam clubbed his ass. This would appeal to the poetic side of human nature, as it could be called “The mass of Balaam’s ass”.</span></p>

It was announced the following Sunday that $20,000 had been gathered in, and this sum was to be used to erect a shrine to the Little Flower. Seven pilgrimages have been held since, each one poorer than the one before. The last, No. 8, was a complete flop. After all these years the shrine has advanced no farther than the basement, while the recipient of the coin has been enjoying the comforts of a 25-room house, the only brick house in the town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A few months ago an architect in northern Ireland was trying to get something for his work for designing buildings for a Roman Catholic priest. The priest meantime died, but the answer returned for him was that the architect was to take his pay in “prayers”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The same stunt was pulled off in Detroit, and a jury awarded $16,000 to architect Peter R. Rossello for designing a church, convent and school buildings. The priest on the job said that the $16,000 worth of work was accepted as a charity donation.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark69"></a>Panhandling Rackets</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">The Society of the Divine Word, of Techny, Ill., in advertising sent out by its “Annuity Department”, entitled “How to Invest”, explains how by giving up your pile you can receive interest at 5 percent to 7 percent as long as you live. Those who handle big money count on doubling it every ten years, and some feel that if they don’t double in seven years it is time to get new efficiency experts on the job of knockingdown and dragging out the public. It will therefore appear that offering to pay around 6 percent a year, provided the payments stop at death, and there is never a chance of getting a cent back on the principal, is fairly safe for the “S.V.D.” (“Society of the Divine Word”).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The advertising states that this idea of giving up his whole pile and getting interest on it only while he lives is “an attractive appeal to the average practical Catholic”. Alas, yes! The literature explains that the “Annuity Contract” is “a legal document acknowledging the receipt of a certain sum of money”. The literature also assures the victim that he will have a happier death and eternal remembrance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Many have wondered how they could eat their cake and keep it, too; but the problem is solved. You just send $2,000 to the Very Reverend Fr. Anthony O.M.C. Provincial, St. Anthony’s Monastery, 2222 West Market St., Louisville, Ky., and, according to the advertising matter,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Franciscan Life Revenue Bonds are fully secured and will give you the returns from your worldly possessions as long as you need and can use them, and the absolute guarantee of heavenly rewards at a time when nothing but prayers count and only masses can bring relief and consolation to your soul which is hoping for release from “purgatory”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Somebody sent in “The Monthly Record of St. Mary’s Church”, McKee’s Rocks, Pa., showing what each one put in the collection during December. Business was down a little, and still the haul was $967.50 for just the item “House Collection” of which details were published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mary Alfons was alphabetically the first name on the list, and Mary parted with $30, the most of anybody. Looks a little fishy that the first one on the list put in the most. Probably somebody helped a trifle on that, so as to get the others to put up more. One gave up $27, one $20, one $14, five $12, three $11, seven $10, five $9, nine $7, eleven $6, twenty-six $5, seventeen $4, one $3.50, twenty-seven $3, fifty-five $2, one $1.50, and eighty-six just managed to raise the $1 necessary to get into the published list.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Whatever they gave up this way is just that much less the priests will be able to get out of them by the skillfully planned lotteries (in violation of the laws of the United States) now being operated by priests and other gangsters in every part of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At Zurich, Ontario, on the shores of Lake Huron, is a small French settlement. When the priest came to town, four years ago, he had an old Ford coupe and the church was in debt. Now the poor fanners have scraped enough together to buy him a brand-new Chevrolet and pay off the mortgage. Recently, to pay off the insurance on the church, the priest taxed 1c for every tooth of every member of the congregation. Families of ten were taxed $3.40, but families of five got through for half that sum. He got the money.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark73"></a>Educational Rackets</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">A New Jersey gentleman, formerly a Catholic, tells of a convent largely supported by his grandfather:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After my sister was there for several years, the mother superior boasted to my grandfather of how she got out of paying taxes on the convent by telling the board of appraisers, when they called, that she had free pupils in the institution, ‘‘but I am sure no gentleman would ask their names.” So the judge did not ask the names; and when my mother was unable to pay longer, all her (my sister’s) clothing was packed and she was sent home to sleep on the floor, for we had no place to put her. In that convent my sister met the man that wrecked her life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At the time of the founding of the Spanish Republic, five years ago, only 30 percent of the people could read and write. That is what parochial schools did for the people, and what they will do anywhere. The children were required to attend many services during the day to receive so-called “religious instruction’’. Instead of learning to read and write, they were kept busy making lace, washing clothes, and making candy. In many instances, when they had completed their school life all they had achieved was to have been slaves for the Roman Hierarchy. They could not even write their own names.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark74"></a>Priests Instigate Murder</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">Determined to educate the Mexican people, the Mexican government held a pageant at Ciudad Gonzales, to impress the people with the importance of learning something besides prostrating themselves before priests. A parade was held in which bands of music led a procession among -which were forty teachers. As the parade passed a Catholic church, a mob rushed out, led by two Catholic priests, and opened fire. Eighteen persons were killed, including a police inspector, two policemen and a soldier. One man was killed by a blow from a hatchet. Many of the wounded said they were hit by bullets fired from the church tower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Immediately, as soon as the news reached Mexico city, the president of the republic rushed there by special train and made a personal investigation. He declared from the pulpit of the church that the ones responsible for the murder were the priests of the church. This is the kind of business a real president of Mexico or any other country ought to do, instead of gallivanting around kowtowing to this bunch of roosters in blade feathers. But Mexico seems to be slipping some, and there are indications that Cardenas is playing to get the church back in power in Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Education is making wonderful progress in the parochial schools. In the St. Louis Globe-Democrat</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Democrat,</span><span class="font10"> James Moore, uncle of one of the children involved, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A priest of one of the Catholic churches in Belleville gave tickets for a show, to sell for 50c, to the boys and girls of that school and told them that they had to sell them or they would be slapped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Noticing that there are many taxpayers who have no children to send to any school, and many taxpayers whose children long since grew up, and many taxpayers are bachelors of both sexes, and half the Roman Catholic children are in the public schools anyway, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The New Age.</span><span class="font10"> suggests that it would be just as reasonable to demand that the cost of private roads, private streets and private bridges be paid out of the public purse as to expect it to pay for the peculiar things taught in parochial schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The chaplain of St. Anne’s church, 1299 Irving St., San Francisco, Calif., sent out a circular letter inviting a selected list of young people, 18 to 30 years of age, to join a social club, and then says, and spells it that way:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">principle</span><span class="font9"> activities of this club will be dancing, dramatics and athletics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Parochial school spelling books must be a joy to behold. A letter at hand from one manifestly educated in one of these centers of &quot;learning” spells certain well-known words as follows: &quot;intelect,” “naueating,” &quot;falsfying,” and &quot;faltz”. Incidentally, this gem was from Ohio, where Catholics, as one of the important steps in seizing control of the state, are demanding state funds to maintain schools.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>Gambling and Liquor Rackets</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">The Pittsburgh </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Press</span><span class="font10"> contains a three-column illustrated story of the Knights of Columbus lottery racket, approved by the board of governors of the New York K. of C. chapter and Michael F. Walsh, of Brooklyn, N. Y., state deputy of the order. In the Pittsburgh haul, besides 25,000 of the New York chapter lottery tickets, there was also found $15,000 worth of merchandise obtained fraudulently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Knights of Columbus are very anxious to straighten out Mexico’s religious affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The same issue of the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font10"> that told about arrests of the Knights of Columbus sweepstakes gang (which put out 700,000 tickets at $1 each and had on hand only $14,000 in cash when they were grabbed) also told about efforts at Albany to make lotteries legal if operated for “charitable, educational and religious institutions”. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font10"> said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The police said the Knights of Columbus acted in good faith in hiring the promoters [of the lottery swindle] and was in no way connected with the use of the mails to defraud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Why, of course they said it. Why would they not ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On a tip from Reverend George Drew Egbert, pastor of the First Congregational church of Flushing, N. Y., president of the Society for the Prevention of Crime, New York police inadvertently raided a regular Monte Carlo gambling ring at the Hotel Commodore, New York city, where professional gamblers were splitting 50-50 on the profits with a Catholic institution and two others not plainly indicated as such. It was comical to see how the story was all smoothed up in the newspapers. Thus the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font10"> said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In raiding the games which have been features of charity functions here for years the police were acting in a routine way in checking up on a complaint made to them, Commissioner Valentine explained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Well, here is hoping that Cardinal Patrick Hayes accepts the apology, or off goes somebody’s head. The police got $5,000 worth of gambling equipment, and let out nine professional gamblers on bail of $500 each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It seems that some organized religious group, not mentioned, but guessed, induced the Michigan Legislature to pass a law making the gambling games of Beano and Keno legal in Michigan if sponsored by religious or charitable organizations. The Episcopalians, not having any gambling or red light annex, wired the governor to veto the bill, as they considered its passage would be a real humiliation to the Christian people of Michigan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The poverty-stricken Carthusian monks, Grenoble, France, lost $1,500,000 at one shot. An avalanche of mud destroyed their distillery in which they had much booze laid up for many years. It is supposed to take twenty-five years to ripen Chartreuse liquor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">International thieves seem to have discovered that there are good pickings at cathedrals. At Pamplona, Spain, recently, they got away with 100 pieces of jewelry, valued, all together, at $400,000. Of what possible benefit it could be to Christ or anybody else to have nearly a half million dollars’ worth of jewels in a so-called “church” building is something that is not explained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the provinces of Campeche and Tabasco, Mexico, the governor requires that before any priests may serve in the Catholic churches of that part of the world they must first be married. What do you suppose is the reason for that? Ask any well-informed Mexican man, and he can tell you.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark78"></a>Good Friday Racket</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">“Good Friday,” not mentioned as such in the Scriptures, has become a racket in Quebec and in many other places. In Quebec city all the theaters and business places except tobacco shops and restaurants were closed for the day, and a period of mourning for a dead Christ was observed for one minute at 4:00 p.m. At the same time the fire-alarm bell tolled 19 times. The legislature recessed and only one newspaper was published. This pretense of sorrow over the death of Jesus is accompanied by the most venomous hatred of His true followers, and would be accompanied by their murder if only the Hierarchy felt that the due time had arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At the Vatican, on Good Friday priests banged their prayer books violently on the benches in commemoration of the death of Christ. The dispatch announcing this nonsense stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The mourning atmosphere was accentuated in Rome tonight by the closing of all motion picture theaters and other amusement resorts.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>Confessional and Purgatory Rackets</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">According to “The Salvatorian Fathers, Salvatorian Seminary, St. Nazians, Manitowoc Co., Wisconsin”, it “not infrequently happens” that those in “purgatory” are “utterly unaided and forgotten after death”, but if you come across with ten dollars “they get as near a personal foundation as possible”. What shame that the wretch who runs the ‘•'purgatory” shambles or bake oven is so contemptible that the only thing that will persuade him to do the right thing is bribery!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Walter J. Doherty, of Oklahoma county, Oklahoma, died recently, leaving property worth $49,835.89. Out of this, $1,000 was to go to a priest in Fort Worth, Tex., to be used for masses for the repose of Dohertys soul while in the bake oven. Anybody who has looked into the matter would be liable to say offhand that Doherty's estate had been stung for a cool $1,000 for which there never could, by any possibility, be the slightest return whatever. But it was not quite that bad. The state of Oklahoma collected $16.12 out of the $1,000, and, as a result, the estate was stung for only $983.88.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mary Ann Walsh, commonly known as Mary Ann Shannahan, of Brownsville and Jamberoo, Australia, died at the age of 83 and left £500 to the Roman Catholic archbishop of Sydney, for the repose of the souls of herself and relatives “whose souls may be in purgatory”. When Mary Ann wakes up, and finds her “hotel” in other hands, and comes to know that “purgatory” was only an ecclesiastical money-making invention, she will almost wish she had had somebody stuff the £500 under her head and take a chance on its being good some years or centuries hence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Irish Press,</span><span class="font10"> Dublin, is quite disturbed by the report that the Hitler government will tax “purgatory” transactions, on the ground that the priest is a “worker at the altar” and whatever he takes in for masses is just so much business revenue; which, after all, is all it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A communication from Mrs. Ed. Perry, of Georgia, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At St. Augustine, Fla., I knew a Catholic woman whose husband had died and she wanted to rent her cottage. I went over to look at it. She was sick in bed. I went in and sat by the bed. As she turned over her gown came open and I saw around her waist a metal band weighing, so she said, about three pounds. She said the priest had put it on, and fastened it and blessed it. She could not take it off without his knowing it. The priest made her believe that it would ward off evil spirits and that no man could ever take advantage of her while that metal was there. It looked like a big spider.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Devil always knows where to find cruel, merciless people that, for a chance to get their hands into the public till, are willing to undertake any job whatever, no matter how much agony they may bring to others. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Colliers'</span><span class="font10"> magazine says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Nuns direct and operate a number of women’s prisons in various paits of the world. Sometimes they have taken over the management of penitentiaries after others have failed in disciplining the inmates. Three of the most famous prisons they run today are in Rennes, France, in Mislea, Rumania, and in Maria-Nosztra, Hungary, 90 percent of the convicts in the last one being murderesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Rome is determined to go ahead, but is slipping backward. The Knights of Columbus are sponsoring 1,100 Boy Scout troops, half the total of the country, but, whereas they claimed a million members in 1920 for their own K. of C. organization, fifteen years later they claimed but a half million. Last year she added 858 priests, but the number of new converts decreased by 391 over the year previous. She is like a dog barking into a hollow log. When the zeppelin Hindenburg came to New York, and the papers had it all fixed up for the glory to go to the Roman Catholic church because some priest said mass on board, not one of the Hindenburg’s officers attended the show.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Never was the Catholic church in any country in the world since Christendom began so rich, so highly organized, so influential, so loyally soldiered by her subjects as she is today in the United States. Never had she a more accomplished and resolute generalissimo than Pius XI. Never was she tempted to make a supreme effort by stakes more large and glorious than those at issue here and now. The effort, the fight, may be drawn out. It may last for five or ten years. Even if it last for twenty—what is twenty years in the life of Rome ? The fight must be fought to a finish—opposition must be worn down if it cannot be swept away. Rome s immortal destiny hangs on the outcome. That destiny overshadows the land. Were Rome to fail to dominate American thought and American lives, her civilization, her moral code, all her glorious incredible dogmas would perish from the earth. Should Rome triumph, she will ascend to a higher state than ever she has enjoyed heretofore. Therefore she must win— if it be given her to win what, as she claims, God has promised—what her prophets have foretold. Then will the vast West be hers wherein to set up anew her earthly kingdom. And in the fight, as she has ever fought when battles were most desperate in the past, Rome will use steel, and gold, and silvery lie. Rome will stoop </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">to conquer.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">Every morning the children must rise at five o’clock (eight years old and up), dress, make their beds, tend to their toilet, say the so-called “morning prayers”, and be ready to go to the chapel by 6:00 a.m., 6:00 to 6: 30 a.m. mass. Six-thirty to seven, breakfast, and then from seven to nine the house must be cleaned and there must be a choir practice ; then from nine to twelve noon each is assigned to her work for that period; some would go to school in the forenoon, and then in the afternoon those who went to school in the morning would do the work that the others did in the morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some had to work in the kitchen, others had to wax hardwood floors on their hands and knees and then rub it in the same way. The rest of the day was spent sewing for some factory on the outside, from which those little children never saw a penny, not so much as a cookie. It was said that they must earn their board and room some way. As soon as they were able to handle a needle they had to sew buttons on by hand all day if not in school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">From twelve noon to twelve-thirty, lunch. Each week a certain number had to wash the dishes, it not making any difference what else you had to do, with the exception of those who worked in the kitchen; they hardly had time to eat</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As for the food, in the five years I was there I never saw a chop or a piece of steak that was for me to eat (the nuns and the priests got that); and for three years there was no butter on the table. We got oleomargarine only on Friday, and only one hard-boiled egg, and that was on Friday. No fresh fruit, although they had their own orchard: the fruit went to market and was canned and put up by the girls of the kitchen. Never a glass of real milk; skimmed was all they got for mush and such things they needed it for, and for sugar they used a liquid which if tasted straight would make one sick; I do not know the name. One dish of ice cream on Easter and one on Christmas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">From twelve-thirty to one o’clock the recreation period, baseball, walking, and swings, and, if you were fortunate enough to have a ball and jacks, fine. One o’clock to six, sewing on the motor-driven sewing machines. Girls ten years old and up used those machines, eight hours a day, five and a half days a week, all through the summer when the vacation period was on. During school months the average time one of those girls sewed was five hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Six to six-thirty p.m. dinner, and six-thirty to eight o’clock recreation, and then to bed. All must be in bed at nine, and no talking, with the exception at the recreation period, not even in the halls or in the dining room.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">A five-minute talk</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">J</span><span class="font10">EHOVAH GOD has made Christ Jesus King of the world and long ago promised that Jesus Christ should appear in due time and rule the world in righteousness. When Jesus was on earth with His disciples He made it clearly to appear to them that as a man He would not rule the world, that as a man He must die in order to provide the ransom price for the condemned human race, and that God would raise Him up out of death, and that then He would appear again and rule the world. At Philippians 2: 5-11 it is recorded that Jesus was put to death as a man and that God raised Him out of death a spirit creature divine, exalted Him to the highest place in the universe, and commanded that every creature should bow to Jesus, and serve and obey Him to the glory of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">From Jesus His apostles had learned that when resurrected He would again appear, and for that reason the apostles often mentioned the second coming and appearing of the Lord Jesus in power and glory. Paul, under inspiration of the holy spirit, quoted the 110th Psalm, at Hebrews ten, using these words: ‘‘But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; from henceforth [awaiting] till his enemies be made his footstool.” From this and other scriptures it appears that when Jesus ascended into heaven, although then clothed with full power and authority as King, He must wait until God's due time to put down the enemy and then He would appear and rule. That exactly corresponds with the scripture relative to the end of Satan's world, and that the apostles so understood is shown by the question propounded to Jesus: ‘What shall be the sign of thy appearing, and of the end of the world ?’ The world war on the earth and the “war in heaven” (Revelation 12: 7-10), as foretold in the Scriptures, began in 1914, and marks the date of the second appearing of the Lord Jesus as King of the world. Then wore fulfilled the words of God’s prophet at Psalm 2: 6, to wit: “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.” Then it was that Jehovah gave Jesus the uttermost parts of the earth for a possession. The second appearing of Christ, and the beginning of the exercise of His power as Jehovah’s executive officer, dates from 1914. This is further corroborated by the words of Revelation 11:17,18, to wit: ‘Thou hast taken thy great power and reigned, and the nations were angry.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With absolute certainty we can now see and do see that Satan’s world without interruption has ended and that Jesus Christ, as earth’s rightful Ruler, has come; that Satan has been ousted from heaven, and that soon the Lord will completely destroy him and his organization on earth, and for that reason Satan is now trying to plunge the entire human race into unbelief and into destruction. That is the reason why the Bible is now openly rejected in many countries of the earth. At the same time the Lord Jesus Christ commands His faithful followers in these words (Matthew 24:14): ‘Go and preach the gospel to all nations as a witness.’ The purpose of obeying this commandment and giving testimony of and concerning the Kingdom is that the people may be afforded an opportunity to make their choice either by remaining on the side of the Devil and suffering death or by taking their stand firmly on the side of God and Christ Jesus and receiving the blessings of life everlasting. If you would have life everlasting you must learn the truth concerning God and His kingdom, because it is authoritatively stated: ‘This is life everlasting, to know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.’ (John 17: 3) The second appearing of the Lord Jesus having already taken place, and the Devil knowing that his time is short before Armageddon, he makes every effort possible now to blind the people and keep them from a knowledge of the truth, and for that reason he causes Jehovah's witnesses to be persecuted because they testify to the truth. This testimony is being given under the direct supervision of the Lord Jesus as the world’s rightful King, and He is holding back His further assault upon Satan until that testimony is completed. When completed Satan and all of his organization will be completely destroyed, and only those who take their stand on the side of God and Christ Jesus will survive that trouble. These survivors are the persons of good will toward God. These truths are of most vital importance to you, and it is your privilege and duty to supply yourself with a Bible and the helps that will enable you to understand the Bible and then diligently seek to know the truth and continue therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is only in obedience to the commandment</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">One girl about seventeen years old was taking care of a little girl that was sick; she had to use some kind of lamp to keep the baby breathing, and during the process her clothes caught fire and she burned to death. I shall never forget that as long as I live, a human running in the dark all in flames. The marks from her feet were still noticeable in the hardwood floor when I left there, nearly two years later, where she had run down the hall on the fourth floor and to the third floor (how she did scream!) to a nun she liked. The nun grabbed her bed covers and threw them on her to put out the flame. There was no water during the night, as they would turn it off in the engine room; why, I do not know. The girl was trying to find water, and going through the draughty hall the flames spread fast. She did not know to lie down and roll out the flames. The door to the lavatory swung back and forth several times before the girl’s dreadful screams began; so she must have been looking for water. She died, and was brought back to the school for the mass, and was buried.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The lights were kept burning all night in the dormitory for more than a year after that, as the children could still see that sight and would begin to scream and cry if the nun turned them off. I wonder if the papers or anyone else ever knew about that; but I doubt it, as I understand she was raised there from infancy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">My knees today show the hard work they stood for. After a number of days’ waxing the hardwood floors and all stairs on my hands and knees I got what they called nuns’ knees. They swelled up three times their natural size. I could hardly sit down, and after I got down it was a hard task to get up again. All the floorwax must be rubbed in, so other children were given the task to do that, and then we all had to polish it with rags under our feet till there never was a dance floor that could come up to it in beauty and slickness. Was that proper work for little children six to fifteen years old to be doing all day, sometimes nine hours a day?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">That was an orphanage division, and not a correction department.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Of course, all must eat, and so the children must work in the kitchen also. Of the five years I spent there I worked in the kitchen about one and one-half years. At the age of twelve I was baking bread for nearly two hundred girls, besides the nuns, one day each week. The pans (large ones) carried about eighteen loaves, two rows. The small ones, from six to eight loaves, and the baking average was from fourteen to sixteen pans a day for five days. Once in a while it would sour on us, but it was never thrown out. It was cut and served. I surely ate more than one piece of sour bread baked by those poor little children. Is this work for children? I wonder. Has Mr. Roosevelt and a few others so interested (???) in child welfare ever seen such things—little children making sauerkraut in 200- and 300-pound barrels; dragging 100-pound sacks of spuds a fourth of a block in snow in zero weather; twelve-year-old children getting up at 4 a.m. to get the dough ready and kneaded for bread? I have seen it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We were given instructions on what to say when company came to see us, and had to be very careful what we did say, as there was a nun there at all times to hear just what was said; and if you said any more than she thought you should say, it was too bad for you afterward. If you received fruit or candies she would say, “I'll attend to that for the child,” and you saw very little of it after.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The nun always read all mail that came into the house, and all that left.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">About 1918 there was smallpox in the building, and about sixteen children caught it. There was a trained nurse there, but they did not want to put her in quarantine with them, as she might be needed elsewhere; so they put me in with the children to nurse them in the infirmary; then, shortly after, two cases of mumps came in, and a case of measles; I had about twenty children to nurse, and by myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The ones with the smallpox had to be treated twice a day by putting iodine on them; my fingertips became burned because of this; they had this put all over the body, to kill the germs. The nurse kept in touch with me through a sliding window and took care of all my needs, including meals. No one else was allowed to come near the room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Shortly after that, about two weeks, I took down with the shingles, and had to keep on the go just the same; anyone who has had that will know it is a terrible torture. They all got well, and after the room was fumigated only a few weeks passed when the flu broke out. They knew that was too much for a child; so the nurse was put in the infirmary with the sick, and they all pulled through with her good care and experience ; then she took down with it, and in four or five days she was dead. Having learned much to help the sick, I was put in a little room to look out for her, but, being only a child myself, could not do for her as I would have had I known better and been older. She was a dear. She taught me many things that have been a great help to me in later years, and no one else really did for me as she did. I loved, too, to do what I could for her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The question is, Is that little children’s work when there are thirty or forty nuns around, grown women ? Many people think those women work so terribly hard. That is not so; in five years I saw only two nuns that really did work: the one :n the chapel, and the other in the nun's’ dining room; they let the little children do the work and they took the credit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In 1919 I asked mother to send for me, as I did not care to stay there after that nurse died. I was not equipped to earn a real living for myself but through sewing or working as a servant in a home; and for a servant's job one had to have references.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark88"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark89"></a>&quot;Holy Hour” and Torturing the Innocent</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">For a whole hour, every afternoon, five days a week, while sewing at top speed, the nun would call on one of the girls to start what she called the “holy hour”; “Hail Mary”; you know the rest; it was all right no matter how fast you mumbled, just as long as you let her know you were saying something that sounded like what you should say; too bad if she caught you saying something other than you should.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If something went wrong, and there was no time for punishment during the week, sometimes the whole class would be required to sit all day Sunday on the chairs in the classroom and not say a word until she was willing to let them go, and never before the children had all gotten down on their knees and said, “Mother, please forgive us.” Many times one would have to sit or stand or kneel all day Sunday in front of a statue, and many times for something not one’s own fault, for such things as talking in the halls, late for school, or skating on the floor, but you always had to ask that woman to forgive you on your benders. Many times the class sat from 9: 30 a.m. to 12: 00 noon and then from 12: 30 to 6: 00 p.m. or until she was willing to forgive them. They then had to work all the week with only two hours a day for relaxation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After this nurse had died a little baby she had been taking care of before the flu broke out was given to me to take care of; and one day, when the little tyke was sitting on the chamber in the bathroom, near a radiator (in the month of November, I believe it was), she fell against the steaming-hot radiator and was not able to lift herself up. The little girl who had put her on it was polishing the hardwood floor in the bathroom while I was making up the beds. I ran in to see what was wrong; then I did for her what I could remember the nurse had told me to do for one that was burned. And how that poor little thing- suffered! The whole left side of her face was burned, and the right hand palm. She was a sight to behold. The little girl who put her near the heat was too young, I guess, to think of the real danger, or that it could cause such damage. Because of this accident I received the worst beating I ever got in my life. The nun said I did it to spite her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All one summer there was not sewing enough to keep the children busy; so from some factory or place outside there came hundreds of pounds of nuts to be cracked and shelled, and the one that did the most pounds (cracking and shelling) would receive an apple or an orange or a piece of cake as the prize for the day's labor; and the others got only their board and room, as usual.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>Malicious, Diabolical Cruelty</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">Then again no work; so we had to peel tomatoes all day so as to make catsup and whatnot out of them; and anyone who peels tomatoes for an hour will begin to feel the difference in the skin, as the acid in tomatoes is strong and will make the skin very white and lovely; yet, too much, and you will feel it. In both cases, with the nuts and tomatoes, it was eight hours a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After that little baby burned her face, and while that nun was giving me a good beating, during the screams I told her that if she did not stop it I would run away from there. She said, “Go ahead and run, and see how far you will get.” But for the full three months that followed she never left me alone in the evening after eight o’clock as she had done before that, but would come and sit in the room where the two babies and I slept, as I took care of them twenty-one hours a day, with only time to go to school. That was my room then, as the babies did not sleep in the same room as the others. She would sit there until I was undressed and ready to get into bed, before she would leave and go to bed. After about six months from this incident I went home. A few weeks later word came that that nun had been transferred to some other place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Could you imagine anyone quite so cruel as to take a child who had wet the bed during the night and put her in a tub of cold water, head and all, naked, and douse her up and down in the cold water? Two much older girls were made to do this job of ducking the one that wet the bed. Again, the girl was made to stand in the middle of the floor and they would hang that wet sheet over her head the way it was taken off the bed, and make her stand there until it was thoroughly dry. Can little children always help that? It would not have hurt her to send that child to the doctor and see if he could do anything to help her. The two children that this happened to quite every night, summer and winter, were two sisters; neither one was as old as I; neither was thirteen yet; and a nun called them wicked. Even in the winter they got a cold duck.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark92"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark93"></a>Ingenious and Unspeakable Meanness</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">When they used the garden almost everything could be grown, corn, tomatoes, potatoes, string beans, peas, all, as well as many other things; gooseberries, blackberries, strawberries; many things more. We got a taste of the corn and vegetables (some of them); not much of the fruit, though, and no berries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Most of this stuff was canned or sent away. They kept enough for their own use, but the children did not see any of the berries at all on their table, or jelly made from them; if they got jelly it was the kind that comes in buckets, and the same for molasses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Floors of the entire building were waxed and scrubbed on hands and knees, about four times a year. The kitchen was not waxed, but scrubbed every Saturday. While scrubbing you must be very careful, as, when it was inspected, if a dark streak was found on your space you had the whole thing to do again. The spaces were about a yard wide and about thirty feet long. One day, right after we had gotten the kitchen all nice and clean, the girl assistant to the chief cook told me to get some nut shells and put them in the fire, and I told her I had put some in. But that was not enough; the fire must be hotter; so I put some more in, and went outside to the cellar to get a sack of potatoes. A girl came out shortly after and told me I was in for it, as the stack of the stove had blown off and dirt was all over the place; dinner was delayed for the entire building, and then the nun was informed of it and she told me I would have the entire kitchen to scrub. I got to bed about 12: 30 a.m. and had to be up at 5: 00 a.m. Those nut shells were used in place of coal to keep the two big ranges going, and were shells to be disposed of after the children got the nut meats out of them;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I never put a nut shell in the stove that this does not come to mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For punishment once in a while, that was to last all day but so as not to interfere with one’s work, a costume was put on a child and she must wear it all day (with the exception in case company came) and to go to the chapel (church). One I remember very well was a long black skirt, about eight inches from the floor, with big circles of all kinds of colors sewed on it all over, a waist of yellow with green polka dots in it about the size of a quarter, a blue sunbonnet with small white dots in it, a pair of cotton stockings, one bright red and the other bright green or purple. This also included a pair of stogies (big shoes three times the right size) that would clank and clamp every step that one took, to draw attention to the one wearing them, to shame her, and must be worn every day till she was willing to ask forgiveness on her knees before that woman and was forgiven.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark94"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark95"></a>Take a Look at the Pretty Hands</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">The girl that was set as housekeeper did not have it a bit easy, but at least did not have that woman with her hair shaved off close to her head, with a long black cloth hanging from it, around all the time. I saw one one night with her veil off, and she surely did give me a scare. The Bible says something about women, that they are not to shave the head; does it not ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This housekeeper girl must wash all windows in the building inside and out, close to 150 windows, I would judge, and all light's and shades; she must help in all decorations for plays. (No nun would climb up a ladder twenty feet or more from the floor.) All waxing was her job, as well as scrubbing the floors. She got help if the whole house was to be done at once, otherwise she got one girl to help her. Four girls did the scrubbing, and all on their hands and knees. No wonder that priest in the East is for child labor; he knows really what little children can do when made do it. And such are the reapers of the money. Wonder how many calluses that man has got from real hard work. Those little tykes could show it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For a while there was a plague of bedbugs, and the squirt can they had did not do the job right (at that time I was assigned to the work of housekeeper); so another girl was given to me to help fight these pests. We had to take every one of the two hundred beds out of the dormitory and hoist them up onto the washbowls in the lavatory and run boiling-hot water over them. (The washbowls were in the middle of the lavatory, about ten in a row, two rows; the toilets and baths, all in one large room.) And was that a job? It had to be done twice before we got rid of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">No nun put a finger to that work. Look at the hands of the next one you meet, if you get a chance, and see what soft, lovely hands they have. Convent day schools and convent orphanages are altogether’ different places; and don’t let anyone tell you differently. I carry calluses on my hands I got before I was ten years old; sometimes they hurt so I have to cut them as one cuts a corn.</span></p>

Mason in district court here today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The three were Anna, 9, Zophie, 12, and Domino, 14, children of Ignace Opielouski, a member of the religious cult of Jehovah’s witnesses. The father was fined $40 for failing to send his children to school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Appeals were taken in the cases of all three children and the father. Bail totaling $800 was supplied to assure appearance of the four at the June sitting of the superior court.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Several • ‘ Witnesses ’ ’ are in Sachsenburg. One of them, whenever he was ordered to say ‘‘Heil Hitler,” would reply’, ‘ ‘ There is only one God and He is Jehovah.” He was flogged but refused to submit.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Mob Law in Lagrange, Georgia</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">L</span><span class="font10">AGRANGE, Georgia, is ruled by an unholy trinity composed of three persons, to wit: Mayor R. S. O'Niel, Chief of Police J. E. Matthews, and City Attorney J. C. Thomason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is the duty of these men to uphold the law, and protect the rights of the people. They took an oath of office so to do. To trample on the rights of the people would mark them as unfit to hold any position of public trust in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On Sunday, May 17, a group of Jehovah's witnesses called on the people of Lagrange at their homes. ‘&quot;His Satanic Majesty,” the Devil, disapproved of their mission, and looked about for someone to interfere. Messrs. O’Niel, Thomason and Matthews were at hand and were commissioned to do the job. They undertook it readily. They discarded their oaths of office and their public trust, and set out to make a record as pontifical inquisitors. They gathered in, arrested, jailed and imprisoned 178 of Jehovah’s witnesses. Whether or not Jehovah’s witnesses were breaking the law made no difference to this unholy triumvirate. Some were preaching the gospel from door to door. Some were walking the streets. Some were sitting in automobiles. One was in a drug store. The jails were soon filled. A YMCA auditorium was then put in use as a temporary place of imprisonment for Christian people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">So it appears that the Young Men’s Christian Association has now put on </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">its</span><span class="font10"> pontifical garments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The remainder of the prisoners were sent to the Troup County Stockade. A book entitled “Twenty Years in a Georgia Chain Gang”, by Robert Burns, will tell you all about that lovely calaboose. Seventy-seven of the servants of Jehovah were confined therein, without bed, bedding, pillows or roof over them. In due time they were compelled to labor with the chain gang under the blazing Georgia sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Why ? For violating the law ? No. Merely to satisfy the spite, malice and general wickedness of the guardians of law and order (?) in Lagrange.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Of course these officers claim they were merely enforcing the law. Their claim is false.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Read on, gentle reader, and be enlightened with conclusive proof that this unctuous, pietis-tical and bigoted bunch were maliciously, wickedly and unlawfully conspiring to keep Jehovah’s witnesses out of Lagrange regardless of law or order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On the day following the above-described outrage this Fascistical triad exposed its purposes very definitely to a committee of Jehovah’s witnesses. Chief of Police Matthews stated, “If you ever come down here with that bunch again, we’ll leave town and turn you over to a mob.” City Attorney Thomason stated, “Well promise you right now, we’re not going to have them in here'.” It is evident that they made early arrangements to carry out their threats. A mob of toughs, hoodlums and plug-uglies was organized to carry on the reign of Jesuitical Fascisticism in Lagrange. It is reported that mill owners and members of the American Legion cordially and gratuitously assisted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On May 31 Jehovah's witnesses again called on the residents of Lagrange, with a petition and protest against the unlawful acts of the officials. A mob, led by J. C. Thomason, city attorney, attacked, assaulted, and drove these people out of the town. Thomason was very zealous and active in this disgraceful piece of business. He followed a worker from door to door abusing and threatening her; telling people that she was a criminal; and in one case snatched the petition out of a householder's hand. He was very successful in making a general nuisance and an unmitigated scamp of himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A man designating himself as a Roman Catholic priest also actively participated, forcing two women into his car, driving them to the city limits and leaving them there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The petition campaign was broken up; the Devil was greatly pleased, and Messrs. Matthews, Thomason and O'Niel thought they did something.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">They did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">They brought shame, disgrace and dishonor to the city which pays for their services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">They trampled on the laws and violated every principle of common decency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">They qualified for membership, medals, and positions of honor in the fraternity of the children of the Devil: John 8: 43,44; Romans 6:16; Matthew 25:41-46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">They rendered first-hand assistance to the campaign of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy against truth and the kingdom of Jehovah, and joined in the persecution of Christians in a manner very pleasing to that unholy institution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There must be some decent citizens in Lagrange. If so, it is time for them to make themselves heard.</span></p>

Toilet accommodations are as bad as at Alexandria. The cells contain only plank beds, with thin coverlets even in winter. In the central prisons the cells are always overcrowded. Straw sacks are used for beds; these are moved about so that diseases are spread. The women are allowed but two fifteen-minute periods a week in the open air. They are often cruelly beaten.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Peter, clearly discerning and boldly acknowledging that Jesus was Jehovah’s anointed King, said, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.” To this Jesus replied, “Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jonah: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven. And I also say unto thee, that thou art Peter [Petros], and upon this rock [Petra] I will build my church; and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”—Matthew 16:15-20. (See </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.,</span><span class="font10"> margin.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The title “Christ” is the Greek expression meaning “anointed”, and is the same as the Hebrew word “Messiah”. It had reference to the long-looked-for King who was the hope of Israel. Peter’s statement therefore showed that he recognized Jesus as the one sent by Jehovah to be the King of Israel. To make this matter public before the time designated by God would lay Jesus open to the charges of “treason” and “sedition”; and it was on these very charges that Jesus was ultimately condemned and nailed to the tree. Nor did Jesus seek to evade this inevitable end of His earthly ministry; but He knew that His hour was not yet due, hence He instructed Peter and the other disciples to keep the matter secret for a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The words of Jesus with reference to the Rock upon which the church would be built have been woefully misapplied. Peter was not the subject of this discussion, and was only indirectly mentioned. Note, however, the statement of members of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy on this subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Cardinal Gibbons, in his book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Faith, of Our Fathers,</span><span class="font10"> said, &quot;Here we find Peter confessing the divinity of Christ and in reward for that confession he is honored with the promise of primacy.<sup>-</sup>’ By this expression those of the Hierarchy mean that Peter is the chief one in the church and that others have since succeeded him in his office of rulership, and, further, that it is necessary to salvation to be subject to such rulers. As a consequence the popes have applied to themselves those passages of the Word of God which refer to the power and position of Jehovah God himself! They have been called, and have called themselves, “the Lord God,” and other similar blasphemous titles.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark161"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark162"></a>“Thou Art Peter”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">While the name which Jesus gave to Simon means “rock”, that is, “a piece of rock,” it is important to note that He uses another word with reference to the rock upon which the church would be built, saying, “Upon this rock </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">[petra; </span><span class="font10">great rock] I will build my church.” Jesus was addressing Peter, in the presence of the other disciples, and had He intended to convey the idea that the church was to be built upon Peter, He would have said, “And on thee will I build my church,” just as He subsequently said, “I give unto thee the keys.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Peter himself understood that Jesus did not mean that the church would be founded on Peter or that he would be given “primacy’’. Peter stated, on a later date, that Jesus Christ was the chief corner stone together with whom, as living stones, the church constituted a spiritual house.—1 Peter 2:4-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Had Peter possessed in any degree the spirit of the religious rulers who claim to be his successors he would certainly not have hesitated to apply to himself the scriptures which speak of the foundation stone upon which the church is built.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is in complete harmony with other Scriptural references to the same subject to apply to Jesus alone the words &quot;this rock”. Paul says, “Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.”-! Corinthians 3:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is entirely contrary to both the logic and the spirit of the passage to direct the words to Peter instead of placing the emphasis upon .1 esus Christ himself who was the one under discussion. “Whom say men that I amand “Whom say ye that I am?” Jesus had asked. It is obviously turning the conversation from its true focus to switch to Peter the application of the words of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As late as the fifth century it was clearly appreciated that “this rock” had no reference to Peter, but to Jesus himself. Augustine, who wrote much on Scriptural subjects and was at that time prominent in the church, so applied the passage, showing that such application was customary in his time. Later the bishops of Home, in their efforts to grasp power, applied the words to themselves, claiming to be successors of Peter and the rock upon which Christ would build His church. It is the same spirit that has led them to claim such titles as “the Lion of the Tribe of Judah”, which are applicable only to the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But Peter had no successors, just as none of the twelve apostles had successors. The Scriptures in Revelation 21:14 show clearly that there were “twelve”, hence no successors. See also Matthew 19: 28; Luke 22: 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The idea of successors to the apostles is excluded by the definitely fixed number of twelve.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark163"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark164"></a>The Keys of the Kingdom</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">Incidental to this discussion is the matter of “the keys of the kingdom of heaven”. The popes claim that they have the keys and can admit or keep out of heaven whomsoever they will. This claim is wholly contradictory’ to the Word of God. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What did Jesus then mean by saying that Peter should have the keys of the kingdom of heaven ? The word keys is evidently used symbolically, and referred to the privilege of unlocking hidden truths and gaining an understanding as to how one might enter the Kingdom. The scribes and Pharisees were charged by Jesus with having taken away the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">key</span><span class="font10"> of knowledge and hindering others from entering the kingdom of heaven. (Luke 11:52) Jesus here confers upon Peter the responsibility and privilege of opening or unlocking the kingdom of heaven by making use of the “keys”. He was to make use of the knowledge which he himself would receive and proclaim it to others so that those who had “ears to hear” might likewise have the matter disclosed to them and enter the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Just what the “kingdom of heaven” would really be was a “mystery hid for ages and generations”. This mystery was due to be “manifested to his saints”.-Colossiansl:26,27, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It became apparent, as a result of Peter’s preaching, that the Kingdom would be made up of a royal company, and not merely one great King. Christ Jesus was to be “King of kings and Lord of lords”, His true followers reigning with Him. These followers would be selected in part from among the Israelites, the privilege being extended to as many as the Lord called; and later the same opportunity was extended to the non-Israelites or Gentiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The matter, however, was hidden for more than four thousand years and the disciples themselves did not get an understanding of it until after the ascension of Jesus into heaven and the outpouring of the holy spirit at Pentecost. (Acts 2:14-18) While He was with His disciples Jesus spoke in parables and they understood not His words. But Jesus told Peter that He would give him the “keys” of the Kingdom, thus opening the way for himself and others to enter in.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark165"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark166"></a>The Two Keys</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">It was at Pentecost that Peter used one of the keys, telling the assembled people that Jesus was the Christ, the Messiah, a fact which had not until then been publicly disclosed, nor its significance made known. Peter said boldly, “Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly, that God hath made him [Jesus] both Lord and Christ.”—Acts 2: 36, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">During the following three and a half years the apostles preached the gospel of the kingdom of heaven to Jews only. At the expiration of that half-week of years the Lord directed Peter to use the other key by arranging for him to unlock the mystery of the Kingdom to Gentiles. The record of the use of the second key is found in Acts 10 and 11. Referring to this on a later occasion Peter, in conference with other disciples, said, “God made choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel, and believe. And God, who know-eth the heart, bare them witness, giving them the holy spirit, even as he did unto us.” It was recognized that God had “visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name”.— Acts 15:7,8,14, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Peter finished the work to be done with the keys which Christ Jesus had given to him, and, the way to both Jews and Gentiles to enter the kingdom of God being open, there was no need of a successor. There is no mention in the Scriptures of successors to Peter. Jesus himself gave to Peter the keys, and He did not authorize a self-appointed “college of cardinals” to pass these keys on to others.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark167"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark168"></a>The Gates of Hell</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">Jesus stated that the gates of hell should not prevail against His church. The word “hell” means, not a place of torment and suffering, but the condition or state of death. “The gates” refers to the way of entering into death or the grave. Since the death penalty was pronounced upon Adam because of sin all mankind have entered the “gates of hell” and no man could deliver himself from the power of hell. “What man is he that shall live and not see death, that shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol [hell] Psalm 89:48, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Christ, as the Redeemer of mankind from death and hell, gave His life that those who believe on Him might not perish, but have everlasting life. (Hosea 13:14; John 3:16) Jesus descended into hell, but did not remain there. (Psalm 16: 8-11; Acts 2: 24-32) God raised Him out of death; hence the gates of hell did not prevail against Him who is the head and foundation of the church. (Acts 10:40) Jesus said, as stated in Revelation 1:18: “I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.” He triumphed over death and hell and has the keys, that is, the power, to release mankind when the time shall come for that to be done.—Revelation 20:13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Nor will the gates of hell prevail against the church composed of the true followers of Christ. Of whom we read, “Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: over these the second death hath no power; but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.” (Revelation 20: 6, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font10"> Death and hell do not prevail against the church nor the rock upon which it is founded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah is the Rock of Ages. It is because of Jesus Christ’s complete harmony with and confidence in His Father Jehovah, the living God, that He himself is a rock foundation unto all that believe on Him. He is the Faithful and True Witness of Jehovah, and His perfect representative, and is appointed the sure foundation of His church and kingdom. “Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Christ Jesus.”—Isaiah 28:16; 1 Cor. 3:11.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Meddlesome Mayors Should Be Careful</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font10">T IS written, &quot;He that passeth by, and med-dleth with strife belonging not to him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.”—Prov. 26:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The mayor of Coatesville, Pa., should give careful consideration to the above text. He has gone out of his way to horn in on strife which is no concern of his. He has set aside his oath of office, and used the power of his position to put Francis Bobb in jail because Francis Bobb preached the gospel in Coatesville. Why this mayor, A. R. Bergstrom by name, should want to join in with the Devil and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in their efforts to suppress the truth is somewhat a mystery. Anyway, let him take notice that people who take dogs by the ears usually get bit. If there is any nostrum good for the bite of a mad dog no doubt ‘'his honor” has now need of a good supply.</span></p>

One of the suspects was ordered to come out of his house by 409 brave men who surrounded his premises at night. He resisted as best he was able, but at length the visitors threw a gas bomb into his house. He came out, and the visitors shaved his head and applied a coat of tar and feathers. Another citizen was similarly treated. Three others were beaten. The abused and maltreated citizens have left for parts unknown, possibly killed by the mob. The state attorney general has refused to make any investigation. California believes in and is fully ready to practice Fascism, Hitlerism, apparently.</span></p>
