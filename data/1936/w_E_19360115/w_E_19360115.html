<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark3"></a>DEFEAT OF THE PHILISTINES</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the Lord is against you; 0 Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Zeph. 2:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH caused the foregoing prophecy to be written manifestly for the purpose of foretelling a great and destructive work to be done by his hand at the end of Satan’s world and when God's King is enthroned and comes to the temple for judgment. That wonderful work when performed will be a vindication of Jehovah’s name. The creatures against whom that marvelous work will be done arc God’s enemies, which enemies must be the ones that have greatly defamed the name of the Most High. They arc enemies that have knowingly done wrong to gratify a selfish desire, and are therefore designated in the Word of God as “wicked”: “But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they’ consume away.” (Ps. 37:20) Such enemies arc the ones that have cruelly persecuted God’s anointed people because such anointed tell the truth of and concerning God and his kingdom. It seems due time for those who love and serve Jehovah to receive from his gracious hand some clear knowledge of and concerning the destruction of the enemies that now persecute them. The matter is now of peculiar interest to the remnant, and the understanding thereof will bring to them comfort and increase their hope. (Rom. 15:4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God shall let me sec iny desire upon mine enemies,” is an assured promise to the anointed remnant. (Ps. 59:10) “Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies; and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me. The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.”—Ps. 92:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>a</sup> The desire of God’s faithful people is to see Jehovah’s enemies completely destroyed in vindication of his name. Prophetically these words recorded in the Scriptures refer to the present time: “For he hath delivered me out of all trouble; and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.” (Ps. 54:7) Again says the prophet of the Lord: “But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.” (Ps. 68:21) Here the words “hairy scalp” seem to picture a class of enemies that have hypocritically claimed to do the will of God but at all times have been the representatives of the Devil. Those enemies “shall lick the dust”. —Ps. 72:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT ENEMIES?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> The Philistines’ acting in conjunction with the Israelites foreshadowed greater things to come to pass at the end of the world, and this is definitely settled by the inspired words: “Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world arc come.” (1 Cor. 10:11) The Philistines were therefore a prophetic people foretelling specific enemies of God that would be active after the coming of the Loid Jesus to the temple, and that especially engage in the persecution of those who serve Jehovah. David had been anointed and made king of all Israel, and Abner, who had represented the northern tribes and who was manifestly carrying out the Lord’s direction to bring all the Israelites unto David under the direction of the Lord, uttered these words, to wit: “And Abner had communication with the ciders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you: now’ then do it: for the Lord hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David 1 will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.” (2 Sam. 3:17,18) This prophecy clearly shows that the Philistines prophetically foretold some enemies against whom God would take positive and forceful action at the end of the world. David, the king, was a type of Christ Jesus, the beloved of Jehovah, who is now upon his throne and at the temple for judgment. Who, then, are the antitypical Philistines, the specific enemies of God and of his anointed?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> The answer in brief is that the Philistines pictured or foreshadowed the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. This, of course, includes all creatures that knowingly render aid and support to the Hierarchy in carrying on the wicked work of that wicked organization. At the present time it would necessarily include practically all the official part of the religious organizations of so-called “Christendom”. There are three separate and distinct elements of Satan’s organization, to wit, religious, commercial and political, and these three elements were pictured by the three nations of Moab, Ammon and Mount Seir. (2 Chron. 20:1, 22, 23) The Philistines stand out particularly as the religious element of Satan’s organization, which element takes the lead in the persecution of God's people. Because this religious element professes to serve God and does not, they are hypocrites and are despicable in the sight of Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Some evidence has heretofore been published in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> supporting the foregoing conclusion, but the matter is of such importance that it is deemed advisable to restate some of that testimony and to add some more, and therefore it is here done. The prophetic drama in which Samson played a most important part, and which has heretofore been published in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> emphasizes the necessity and importance of complete faithfulness to God on the part of his anointed, their faithfulness continuing even unto death. The chief point to be considered in this present communication or publication is concerning the Philistines and the persecution of the anointed of God by the antitypical Philistines, and God’s work to be done and accomplished concerning the same. The following facts therefore should be carefully considered by those who love God, that they may take courage and increase their hope. The Philistines were descendants of Ham, through Mizraim. (Gen. 10:6,13,14; Amos 9:7) They were worshipers of the Devil, their deities being the fish-god Dagon and Baal-zebub. (Judg. 16:23; 1 Sam. 31:8-10; 2 Ki. 1:2,3) God denounces the Philistines in his Word as soothsayers, which means that they were devil worshipers and practiced the devil religion. (Isa. 2:6) The Philistines migrated from Egypt, which is a type of Satan’s organization. They moved into and took possession of a part of Palestine along the coast of the Mediterranean sea, which territory God assigned to the tribe of Judah. They were at all times the enemies of and willful oppressors of God’s chosen people. They therefore pictured a class of people that pretend to have come out of or forsaken Satan’s organization, and pretend to worship God, but who in fact serve and worship the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’The Roman Catholic Hierarchy is the official government that controls and rules the religion of so-called “Christendom”. What was at one time known as “Protestantism” is now dead, and the so-called “Protestants” are dominated and controlled by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Protestantism exists only in name, not in fact. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy is defined in its own publications as follows: “The Catholic Hierarchy, or the governing body of the Catholic Church, consists of His Holiness the Supreme Pontiff, assisted by the Sacred College of Cardinals and by several Sacred Congregations, or permanent ecclesiastical committees, of which the Cardinals are the chief members; by the Patriarchs, Archbishops and Bishops; by the Apostolic Nuncios and Delegates, Vicars and Prefects, and by certain Abbots and other Prelates.”—See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Official Catholic Directory,</span><span class="font5"> 1935.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> The Roman Catholic Hierarchy by improper means controls the thoughts and course of action of millions of people of good will, but who are ignorant of the truth. By keeping those people in ignorance the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has deceived them. The time has now come for these people of good will to be liberated from the wrongful influence of the Hierarchy, and doubtless that is the reason why Jehovah will now make known to all who love God the truth of and concerning his purpose relative to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Jehovah’s purpose, which he has carried forward from the beginning, is to establish a government or kingdom under Christ Jesus that shall rule the world in righteousness. Until that kingdom is established and in full operation in the earth Satan is the invisible ruler or “god” of the nations of the earth. For that reason Jesus said: “My kingdom is not of this world.” —John 18:36.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Jesus laid down the rule that all his true followers must separate themselves from the world. Because Jesus chooses, and takes out of the world, those who become his true followers and are devoted to him, such ones so taken out are the objects of persecution by Satan and his visible seed on the earth. (John 15:18-20) The true followers of Christ Jesus are represented in the trihe of Judah, meaning those who serve and praise Jehovah God. Egypt, in the Bible, pictures Satan’s organization or the wicked world out of which the true followers of Christ Jesus must and do come. Others claim to have come out of the world and to be followers of Christ Jesus, but the indisputable facts show that many of such are still a part of the world of Satan. The Roman Catholic organization claims to have come out of the world and assumes that position before man and claims to represent God and Christ, but the indisputable facts show that such claims are false and that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is an integral part of Satan’s world. The nominal head of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is the pope, and the claim is that the first pope was the apostle Peter, and that all other so-called “popes’’ are the successors of Peter; which claims are absolutely without truth and are directly contradicted by the Scriptures and every fact in history. The apostle Peter was the true and faithful follower of Christ Jesus, and he kept himself wholly and entirely separated from the world; whereas every pope of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has claimed temporal power and has exercised that power, when possible, and has taken a part in the financial and political affairs of this world. The apostle Peter had no successor, and therefore it was impossible for any man to have ever thereafter filled his position. He was never a pope.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> The brief statement of facts concerning the development of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is this: Satan, pursuing his fixed policy of fraud and deceit, and for the purpose of turning men away from God and Christ, set about to build up a religious organization, named it ‘ ‘ Christianity ”, and uses it for the purpose of deceiving men and reproaching Jehovah. After the death of the twelve apostles of Christ Jesus Satan stealthily and gradually built up an organization or religious system, which has ever since been known as “Christian”. Each church or local division of the organization at the beginning and thereafter had its bishop, but by the time the first pope was selected and installed as pope by the Hierarchy, there were approximately 1,800 bishops serving different parts of the Catholic organization. The bishop of the organization at Rome was selected as the first pope. Says a well-known authority: “Pope is an ecclesiastical title now used exclusively to designate the head of the Roman Catholic Church. In the fourth and fifth centuries it was frequently used in the West of any bishop; but gradually it came to be reserved to the bishop of Rome, becoming his official title.”—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Britannica,</span><span class="font5"> Volume 22, page 81.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> If there were any other evidence required to negative the claim that the pope was a successor of the apostle Peter, the above historical fact would be sufficient for that purpose. For more than 300 years after the death of the apostle Peter there was no pope but there were many men in the Catholic organization called “bishop”. By what authority could any body of men determine that the bishop at Rome should succeed the apostle Peter in office? Who could determine authoritatively which one of the 1,800 self-styled “bishops” was the successor of Peter, if it were possible for Peter to have a successor? Since the apostle Peter was never a pope and never had a successor, it is clear that the claims by the Papacy arc entirely false. Such a claim is absurd and without the slightest proof in support thereof. Since the time the Roman Catholic organization started in the pope business and began to have popes, a vacancy occurs from time to time, and such vacancy in that office is filled by the vote of the college of cardinals by voting into office one of their own number. Men without any authority whatsoever from God or Christ Jesus formed and continue to operate the Roman Catholic system or organization. The father of that organization is Satan the Devil. It is the fruit of the Devil’s successful scheme to defraud men and reproach God, and by that organization the Devil has succeeded in blinding millions of honest persons who have been drawn to the Roman Catholic organization and who have been induced to believe that such organization is a servant of Christ, when in fact that organization serves and supports the Devil, and good people who have supported the organization have unwittingly been serving and supporting the Devil’s servants. The Hierarchy is the masterpiece of the Devil’s organization schemes to defame the name of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus and to turn men away from Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> A brief reference to the history of the Roman Catholic system is here appropriate. From a history written by a man by the name of Lord and called “Old Roman World” the following excerpts are quoted: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘‘In the First Century</span><span class="font5"> not many wise or noble were called. . . . </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">In the Second Century</span><span class="font5"> ... it was a disgrace to be a Christian in the eye of fashion or power. . . The Church . . . was a small body of pure and blameless men who did not aspire to control society. But they had attracted the notice of the government and were of sufficient consequence to be persecuted. ” During the Second Century “bishops had become influential, not in society, but among the Christians”. Then “ecclesiastical centralization commenced; . . . The Church was laying the foundation of its future polity and power ’ ’.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> It is certain that the Lord God had not marked out such a policy. It is equally certain that it was the Devil who was planting and cultivating the seeds of selfishness to accomplish his wicked purpose. The historian above mentioned continues: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘'The Third Century</span><span class="font5"> saw the Church more powerful as an institution. . . . Doctrines were systematized [into creeds and confusion], . . . Great bishops ruled the growing church. . . . The Church was rapidly advancing to a position which extorted attention of mankind [of the world, to be sure]. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">It was not till the Fourth Century </span><span class="font5">—when imperial persecution had stopped, when Constantine [the emperor of Pagan Rome] was converted; when the Church was allied with the State, when the early faith was itself corrupted; when superstition and vain philosophy [prompted by the Devil] had entered the ranks of the faithful; . . . when synods were brought under political influence; . . . when politics and dogmatics went hand in hand. . . . that men of rank entered the church. When Christianity became the religion of the court and of the fashionable classes, it was used to support the very evils against which it originally protested. The Church was not only impregnated with the errors of Pagan philosophy, but it adopted many of the ceremonies of oriental [Devil] worship, . . . The clergy, ambitious and worldly, sought rank and distinction. . . . They became lazy, arrogant and independent. The people were shut out of the government of the church. The bishop became a grand personage who controlled and appointed his clergy. . . . The mission of the [true] Church was lost sight of in a degrading alliance with the State.”—Also see </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures,</span><span class="font5"> Volume 2, page 284 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ct scq.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> It was at this stage of a degenerate organization of the church called “Christian” that the Roman Catholic system had its birth and beginning by selecting out of the numerous bishops one, to wit, the bishop of Rome, as the first pope. From then till now the Roman Catholic system, otherwise called the “Roman Catholic Hierarchy”, has ruled millions of people by means of superstition, fear and false doctrines. The ancient Philistines migrated from Egypt and came into the land of Palestine. Ancient Egypt is repeatedly used in the Scriptures as representing Satan's world or organization. The Christian church began by men coming out from the world and making themselves separate and distinct from the world, that is, antitypical Egypt. (Rev. 11: 8) By subtlety and fraud Satan planted within the midst of those Christians ambitious men who got control of the organization. Then the organization became corrupt and continued corrupt, and from that time till now every attempt to reform it has failed. Honest men and dishonest ones have been in the church systems, side by side, but in Jehovah’s providence the time has come now for those people of honesty and good will to hear and know the truth and to have opportunity to separate themselves from the wicked organization that defames Jehovah’s name and to fully unite themselves with the organization under Christ.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">LAND OF JUDAH</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> When Jehovah led his chosen people, the Israelites, out of Egypt and into the land of Palestine by the hand of Joshua, He caused the land to be divided between the tribes; and to the tribe of Judah was assigned all that land of the south, from the Dead sea to the Mediterranean sea. (Josh. 15:1-47) They found the Philistines already there, who had also come out of Egypt. The land of Palestine divided between the tribes was symbolic. The tribe of Judah stands for those who serve and praise Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. The Lord Jesus Christ is of that tribe, and one of his titles is “The Lion of the tribe of Juda”. (Rev. 5:5) Long thereafter one of the popes of Rome assumed that title, and since then he has been wrongfully known as “the lion of the tribe of Juda”. The Philistines, although in the land of Judah, did not serve and praise Jehovah God. Their position would indicate that they should do so, but their course was exactly the contrary. Likewise the Roman Catholic system has assumed amongst men the place of those who are devoted to Jehovah and his King, but that system does not serve Jehovah and his King. It is selfish in the extreme, attempts to control the things of this wicked world, forms a part of this wicked world, and without any question of doubt is the servant of the Devil: “Know je not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom yc obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?”—Rom. 6:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> Because the Roman Catholic system pose before the peoples of earth as the representatives and servants of God, but in fact are the servants of the Devil, they are the grossest hypocrites. The Philistines were ruled by five kings or nobles, and they were held together by means of a confederacy or an agreement between them. The modern Phdistines, to wit, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, are a government or rule formed and held together by a confederacy of “patriarchs, metropolitans, archbishops, bishops and priests”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Shipley)</span><span class="font5"> The members of the Hierarchy are regarded by themselves and others as nobles, similar to the nobles or rulers of the Philistines.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>17</sup>The land which Jehovah promised (by his oath binding that promise) to give to his chosen people is his kingdom under his beloved Son, Christ Jesus. (Gen. 13:15; 17: 8; Luke 22: 29, 30) The Philistines were in the land before God’s chosen people arrived there. Likewise the modern Philistines, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, occupied the place or condition claimed by them as a divine provision for that organization, before the anointed ones are taken out of the world and anointed of the Lord. Jehovah declared that he left the Philistines in the land of Palestine to prove his chosen people. “Now these are the nations which the Lord left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan ; namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entering in of Hamath. And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the Lord, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.”—Judg. 3:1,3,4.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Likewise Jehovah has permitted the Roman Catholic Hierarchy organization to occupy the place wheie-in they claim to represent God until he selected and anointed his people, and in order that he might prove that his people love God and prove it by unselfish obedience to his commandments under stress. These faithful ones maintain their integrity toward Jehovah, and they must do it in the face of wicked opposition.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> As further evidence that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy have assumed the place that properly belongs to the Judeans or those who truly praise and serve Jehovah, note that the claim is made that the bishop of Rome, otherwise called “the pope”, is the vicegerent of Christ. The claim of that institution is that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is a divine institution and that it is a counterpart of the heavenly organization of Jehovah God: “At the council of Trent, in which anathema is pronounced upon ail who deny the existence within the Catholic church of a hierarchy instituted by divine appointment.”—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Britannica,</span><span class="font5"> Volume 13, page 453.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> It is the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the modern Philistines, that claim infallibility for the pope. Such infallibility, however, was not openly claimed until A.D. 1870, when the Vatican Council issued a dogmatic statement to that effect. Thus it is seen that the Devil stealthily and subtly led the people by fraud and deceit into a position where they might be induced to believe that a man is infallible in matters pertaining to the course of life that men should follow. This claim is made in the face of the inspired Word of Jehovah God, which says that all men are born in sin and shapen in iniquity, which includes the pope. (Rom. 5:12; Ps. 51: 5) Does it not seem strange that 1,800 years was required for the Catholic organization to reach the conclusion of the infallibility of its head? A pronouncement by the Vatican Council says: “We teach and define as a divinely revealed dogma, that the Roman Pontiff, when he speaks </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">er cathedra—</span><span class="font5">i.e. when, in his character as Pastor and Doctor of all Christians, and in virtue of his supreme apostolic authority, he lays down that a certain doctrine concerning faith or morals is binding upon the universal Church,—possesses, by the Divine assistance which was promised to him in the person of the blessed Saint Peter, that same infallibility with which the Divine Redeemer thought fit to endow His Church, to define its doctrine with regard to faith and morals; and, consequently, that these definitions of the Roman Pontiff are irreformable in themselves, and not in consequence of the consent of the Church.”—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Britannica,</span><span class="font5"> Volume 14, page 511.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>31</sup> Not one word is found in the Scriptures to warrant any such conclusion by any man or body of men as above stated. Thus it is seen that a small body of self-constituted rulers set up their own doctrines contrary to and in defiance of the inspired Word of Jehovah God. By this means they induce millions of people to believe the doctrines of the Roman Catholic church, and they take away from them the Bible so they cannot learn the truth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DEVIL’S REPRESENTATIVES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> That the ancient Philistines were the representatives of the Devil there is not the slightest doubt in the mind of anyone who believes the Bible is God's Word. The Philistines practiced the devil religion. Their national god or deity was Da gon, the fish-god. When the Philistines seized the ark of Jehovah’s covenant, and carried it away to their own place, Jehovah expressed his anger against the Philistines, as it is written: “And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod. When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon. And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord.</span><span class="font5"> And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again. And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the Lord; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold: only the stump of Dagon was left to him. Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon’s house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day. But the hand of the Lord was heavy upon them of Ashdod; and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod, and the coasts thereof. And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god. They sent, therefore, and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel'! And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither. And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the Lord was against the city with a very great destruction; and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.” (1 Sam. 5:1-9) The Philistines were offering sacrifice unto their Devil-god Dagon at the time Samson pulled down the building upon them, killing thousands.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> Jehovah caused these facts to be written and recorded in the Scriptures for the purpose of foreshadowing the modern-day enemies of his people. (1 Cor. 10:11; Heb. 10:1) The Philistines were the mortal enemies of Jehovah’s chosen people, the Israelites, and therefore foreshadowed the mortal enemies of Jehovah’s witnesses now on the earth. The ehiefest among such enemies, who hypocritically claim to represent God, are those of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. The Philistines caused their fish-god to wear a miter showing that his chief or head was the Devil, whom he represented amongst the Philistines. When the pope, the head of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, sits on the high altar of Rome to receive adulation he wears a miter identical with that worn by the fish-god Dagon. Thus the pope shows by this symbol what god he represents in fact. The following historical fact is cited in support of the foregoing:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">‘‘As the pope bears the key of Janus, so he wears the mitre of Dagon. The excavations of Nineveh have put this beyond all possibility of doubt. The Papal mitre is entirely different from the mitre of Aaron and the Jewish high priests. That mitre was a turban. The two-horned mitre, which the Pope wears, when he sits on the high altar at Rome and receives the adoration of the Cardinals, is the very mitre worn by Dagon, the fish-god of the Philistines and Babylonians. . . . The gaping jaws of the fish surmounting the head of the man at Nineveh arc the unmistakable counterpart of the horns of the Pope’s mitre at Rome.”—Hislop’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Two Babylons,</span><span class="font5"> page 215.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>24</sup> There can be no doubt that Dagon, the visible god of the ancient Philistines, foreshadowed the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, of which the pope is chief. The Scriptural and the historical evidence fully agree upon this point. The miter similar to that worn by the fish-god Dagon, and by the pope, is also worn by other bishopsofthe Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Thisfurther supports the conclusion that the Philistines foreshadowed the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Manifestly the Lord is now revealing to those who love him these facts that they may have a proper vision of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and know for a certainty what fate awaits the enemies that now reproach Jehovah’s name and persecute his anointed ones.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DOMINION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>25</sup> The Philistines had dominion over Israel due to the fact that the Israelites had been unfaithful to their covenant. (Judg. 13:1; 14:1,4) There were lew exceptions amongst the Israelites, such as Gideon, Samson and others, which men were faithful and true to Jehovah God. Due to the fact that almost all professed Christians during the past 1,800 years have been unfaithful to God, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has had dominion over “Christendom” in matters pertaining to religion, polities and commerce. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy claims the right and power to control and rule the world, and it exercises this rule over almost all of “Christendom”. The faithful amongst the Israelites, such as Gideon, Samson, Samuel, and David, represented the anointed, faithful followers of Christ Jesus now on the earth, and who refuse to bow to the dictates or rules of the modem Philistines.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> For centuries the Roman Catholic organization has claimed the divine right to rule the nations of the earth, and based upon such false claim that wicked organization has attempted to control the political affairs of all the nations of earth. Its rise to temporal power began in the sixth century, and it continued to increase and to exercise that power for a thousand years. The Roman Catholic organization falsely claims that the thousand years of its “successful” reign is the thousand years mentioned in Revelation, the twentieth chapter, when Christ and his saints reign, and that the period of time from 1800 down to the present time is the “little season” mentioned in the same chapter of Revelation. Of course, their claim is false. But that “little season” will end in the destruction of the Devil and his agents. The end and destruction of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is near at hand.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>27</sup> For many centuries the Hierarchy, acting by its official head, the pope, claims the right to crown and unseat kings and to generally dictate the policy of the governments of the earth. Otherwise stated, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy seeks to be an absolute dictator in utter disregard of the rights of the people. Today in every nation where a dictator exists and rules it is the Hierarchy that is behind the dictator and in fact dictating the policy of such government.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PERSECUTION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> The Philistines were the oppressors and persecutors of the Israelites, who were of God’s chosen people. In the days of Samson, Eli and Samuel the Philistines attempted to get all the “milk and honey” of the land of Palestine. Likewise for centuries the Roman Catholic organization has attempted to get all the riches and sweetness of the earth. It is a noticeable fact that they have selected the most beautiful spots on earth to erect their buildings and places of official action. The Philistines oppressed the Israelites for many years. They imprisoned Samson and put out his eyes. They fought against the Israelites time and again and tried to destroy David when he was anointed and installed as king of Israel. (2 Sam. 5:17-25) Likewise the Roman Catholic Hierarchy organization at all times has oppressed and persecuted the followers of Christ Jesus, and now centers its persecution upon Jehovah’s witnesses. The pages of history covering a period of approximately 1,500 years record many of the most wicked deeds of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and which deeds and crimes find no parallel in any other organization ever on the earth. Reference here is made to only a few of the terrible crimes committed by the Hierarchy and its agents; and the purpose of citing even sueh is to show that the Hierarchy is the antitype of the Philistines, and the relation that it bears to Jehovah’s witnesses. The Philistines enriched themselves by laying tribute and other burdens upon the Israelites. For many centuries the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has enriched itself by laying grievous burdens upon the people of all nations of “Christendom”. For many years that hypocritical organization has engaged in the collection of money tribute from the dupes of the Catholic organization. Hooded female agents, garbed like black birds of prey, make regular visits to the many factories and offices on payday and collect from the fearful and superstitious money which the laborers so much need for the support of themselves and their families. Thus by the practice of fraud and deceit millions of dollars are extracted from the pockets of the people, and particularly those of the needy, and this money is used to enrich the Hierarchy and to satisfy the beastly desires of wicked and selfish men.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> Tribute money is collected from the living, whose friends have died, and this upon the pretext that some priest of the Catholic organization may utter a prayer for the dead and thus benefit the dead. Such is an oppressive fraud practiced upon the superstitious and fearful. The Scriptures, without exception, teach that those who die are no longer alive, but are dead, unconscious and “know not any thing”; that none of the dead are in purgatory or in torment, and the claim that men may utter prayers in behalf of the dead and render them benefit is wholly false and fraudulent and is a great burden and oppression to the fearful people. For many years tribute money has been collected from the people of the nations of “Christendom” and sent to the Vatican at Rome to fill the coffers of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and this has been greatly to the oppression and'detriment of the people. In Mexico alone for many years the Hierarchy extracted from the pockets of the common people annually thirty million dollars, which money was sent to the treasurer of the Hierarchy at Rome. It was in Mexico where an agent of the Catholic organization compelled the natives to build in one small town many so-called “church buildings” and there installed priests of the Hierarchy that they might collect from the poor natives practically all they earned. The ancient Philistines attempted to get all the riches of the Israelites, and likewise the modern Philistines attempt to get and control all the riches of the world called “Christendom”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">INQUISITION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>80</sup> The followers of Christ Jesus were persecuted to some extent by Pagan Rome. But such persecution did not begin to compare with the wicked persecution of Christians by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, or what is otherwise known as “Papal Rome”. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy instituted and prosecuted a system of fiendish persecution, the like of which was never before known, and there has been nothing to compare with it since. The doctrines promulgated and taught by selfish men, and which originated with the Devil, were entirely contrary to the truth as taught by Christ Jesus and the prophets of Jehovah, and yet these false doctrines were thrust upon the people. The Roman Catholic organization, claiming the sole right to determine what the people should hear and believe, have kept the Bible away from the common people and compelled them to hear and to believe the false doctrines based upon superstition and fear, which are taught by men. This wicked organization has induced millions of people to utter the name of Christ but at the same time to believe and follow the precepts of men. Therefore God has recorded in his &quot;Word: “Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men: therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder.’’—Isa. 29: 33,14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>31</sup> If anyone dared to express his opinion contrary to the doctrines taught by the clergy of the Roman Catholic organization, that one was straightway charged with heresy. Early in the eleventh century many persons charged with heresy because they dared hold or express an opinion contrary to the Roman Catholic organization were executed by burning or strangling.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>32</sup> The Inquisition was instituted for the purpose of detecting and punishing all persons guilty of any offense against the Roman Catholic orthodoxy. By the time of the thirteenth century it was in full sway. Popes appointed commissioners who traveled from place to place, spying out the people. Arriving in a district, those commissioners called upon the people to confess if they were heretics or to denounce those whom they believed to be heretics, and many were arrested and punished merely upon such denunciation. The bishops assumed the responsibility of providing the prisons and other means of punishment. Cruel torture was employed to force confessions from persons charged with heresy. AH manner of fiendish instruments were employed in such torture. The following were some of the means of torture employed: The victim’s feet were seared with red-hot irons; he was required to put on an iron boot which was poured full of “red-hot” lead; the body of the victim was placed in a machine that pulled his joints out of place; others were placed under a machine containing knives and the victims were slowly cut in pieces. Any lawyer who dared to appear in defense of a person charged with heresy was held guilty of the crime of heresy, and thus the victims were without any means of defense or aid. The Inquisition was prosecuted with malice and vigor in Italy, Spain, the Balkan states, Ireland, England, Germany, France, Mexico, Cuba, and in fact in almost all countries known as “Christendom”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>33</sup> Two features of the Inquisition stand out prominently, to wit, prosecution for speech, and suppression and destruction of books. The manifest purpose of such prosecution and the destruction of books was and is to keep the people in ignorance and to hide from them the frauds of the Roman Catholic organization. Says the historian: “All books had to pass through the hands of the bishops” for the purpose of deleting anything that might appear to be against the Roman Catholic organization. That organization then would not permit anything to be published that might “shock their religious susceptibilities”, and they still continue to raise the same cry. Every crime known to the criminal calendar was committed by the leaders of the Inquisition. The common people were kept at all times in fear and dread. Many of them were forced to denounce their neighbors and cause their execution, hoping thereby to save themselves from the wrath of the Hierarchy’s inquisition. It was not possible for the people to gain any knowledge concerning Jehovah and his gracious provision for the human race, because the modern Philistines, the Catholic Hierarchy, prevented them from gaining such knowledge. No books bearing upon the Scriptures were permitted to get into the hands of the people. (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Britannica,</span><span class="font5"> “Inquisition.”) The gross and flagrant crimes of the Hierarchy and its agents had somewhat of a sct-back about the year 1800, and thereafter the Hierarchy adopted a more refined method of the commission of crime. To this very day that wicked institution continues to suppress the publication of books that teach the truth of God’s Word, and causes many of such books to be burned, and this is particularly true with reference to the books published by the </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society.</span><span class="font5"> The common people that have been induced to support the Catholic organization arc forbidden by the priests to read such books explaining the truth of God’s Word. All organizations that have ever been on earth have not done as much as the Roman Catholic organization to oppress the people and to keep them in ignorance of God’s Word. That organization, therefore, constitutes the worst visible enemies of God and his anointed people. They now harass, persecute and imprison those who teach the truth, and they do this out of spite.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>31</sup> The Philistines were “soothsayers”. (Isa. 2:6) That means that they were the practicers of devil religion. Likewise the Roman Catholic system is made up of soothsayers. The following prophecy specifically applies to them: “Their land [the position they occupy amongst men] is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made [thus, as a means of obtaining revenue, they induce the common people to buy their images, to use these in their worship] : and the mean man boweth down, and the great man humblcth himself.”—Isa. 2:8,9.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>35</sup> In the Catholic organization the meanest man bows before the Catholic prelate, even as the Lord foretold. Even at this day the Roman Catholic Hierarchy cause to be exhibited upon the screens at the theaters moving pictures showing Roman Catholic priests performing senseless ceremonies, claiming thereby to bless automobiles and thus prevent accidents to the riders therein, and this regardless of how bad the riders or drivers might be. This also furnishes the Hierarchy a means of fraudulently obtaining money by playing upon the credulity of a fearful and superstitious people. The foregoing is a statement of a few of the wicked deeds and crimes of the Hierarchy, and such is the crowd that claims to be the divine successor of the apostle Peter. Surely when the people know the truth, they will separate themselves completely from such hypocrites.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">POLITICAL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>36</sup> The Philistines were in a political confederacy that carried on wars of conquest for the avowed purpose of controlling and ruling the people. Likewise the Roman Catholic organization, the modern Philistines, while operating fraudulently and falsely under the name of Christ, is a confederacy of selfish men organized and carried on purely for political and financial and other selfish purposes. The political agents of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy operate in every nation of earth. That wicked organization dominates the political offices of all the nations of ‘‘Christendom”. Heretofore the Hierarchy has found it rather difficult to get control of the United States, but at the present time it is making more progress in that way. Otherwise stated, the American republic, which is supposed to be a free nation, is now practically under the domination of a foreign power, and that foreign power is the modern Philistines, which has its main office of operation at Vatican City, Rome. Take notice of some of the historical facts that now follow:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>37</sup> In the seventeenth century the Roman Catholic organization gained a real foothold on the American Continent by the founding of the province of Alary-land by the family of Lord Baltimore. Today it is the strongest political organization in America. Its </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Official Directory</span><span class="font5"> of 1935, a book containing more than a thousand pages, a book that is ten and one-half by seven inches, is filled merely with the record of the officers of the Hierarchy and its agents. The covetous ambition of that organization has been to get complete control of the United States. On September 23, 1900, a federation of all Catholic societies in America was formed, to wit, ‘‘for the avowed purpose of influencing legislation” and securing what Catholics claim are ‘‘their rights” in America. An archbishop of the Hierarchy said: ‘‘We must make America Catholic. Why should we fear or hesitate ? Catholies in America are loyal to their church [the Hierarchy] first and devoted to her leaders. They are conscious of their power and under’ complete Hierarchical organization.” (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> November 15, 1935.) Says </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The National Catholic Register:</span><span class="font5"> “It is God’s plan that the holy father of Rome should be the temporal and spiritual head of his kingdom on earth.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(The Watchtower, </span><span class="font5">January 1, 1936) Like the ancient Philistines, this is a bold claim by the Hierarchy of the position or the place of “Judea”, which properly is the place of those who truly worship and serve Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. The president of the United States, in 1916, made one Tumulty, a 33rd degree Knight of Columbus, his private secretary, concerning which </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The National Catholic Register</span><span class="font5"> said: “Next to the President . . . Tumulty . . . wields the greatest political power of any man in America.” (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> January 1, 1936, ][ 23.) It was under the administration of President Wilson and Tumulty that Jehovah’s witnesses were sentenced to eighty years’ imprisonment for telling the truth, and the agents of the Hierarchy brought about that result.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>38</sup> Franklin 1). Roosevelt was elected president in 1932. His campaign manager, and now his chief cabinet officer, is a Roman Catholic, more interested in the Hierarchy than in the peoples of America. In the Roosevelt political organization there are more Catholics than of any other professed religion. In April, 1933, the pope inaugurated the so-called “holy vear”, which received the endorsement of the president of the United States and his official family. The Roman Catholics for the past few years have carried forward a campaign of wicked libel and slander against Jehovah’s witnesses, attempting to drive them from the radio, and thus prevent the people from hearing the truth. A petition of two and one-half million American citizens was filed with the government, demanding that the government use measures to prevent this unwarranted interference with the people’s receiving the truth. But the Roosevelt administration refused to do anything. Persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses by the Hierarchy increases, and many harmless men and women are imprisoned because they bear testimony to the Word of God.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>39</sup> On March 8, 1934, the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Sun</span><span class="font5"> published a special dispatch from Rome reporting that ‘a definite agreement had been reached between President Roosevelt and the Vatican to the effect that diplomatic relations shall be established between the United States and the Holy See as soon as public opinion in America might be brought around to it’. In other words, the president of the United States agreed to support the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, a forei”ii power, and to openly do so as soon as the public could be blinded enough to come around to it. The Hierarchy then pushed its campaign to bring the American people around to this very point. On March 17, 1935, there was a mobilization of all Catholic societies in America, representing every state in the Union, the announced purpose of which is to educate the American people to submit to political, diplomatic relationship between the Vatican and the United States, that is, to receive political ambassadors of the Vatican at American political councils at Washington. The foreign power, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy organization, already maintains at Washington an “apostolic delegate”. Says the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Official Catholic Directory </span><span class="font5">for 1935: “The apostolic delegate to the United States is Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, born in Italy, February 24, 1883, . . . appointed apostolic delegate to the United States and Titular Archbishop of Laodicca, March 17, 1933”; that is to say, after Mr. Roosevelt became the president.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>40</sup> At the instance of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy Jehovah’s witnesses are now being cruelly persecuted in all parts of “Christendom”, and particularly in Austria, Germany, Estonia, and Quebec, and New Jersey. In the above-mentioned foreign countries books of the Watch Tower Society, explaining the Bible, have been seized and destroyed, and many of Jehovah’s witnesses, the true followers of Christ Jesus, are charged with seditious conspiracy and thrown into prison because they had in possession or distributed such books, and all this wicked persecution of faithful witnesses of Jehovah is done by those who claim to be the successors of the apostle Peter and the official representatives of God and Christ on earth. Amazing hypocrisy! This persecution the modern Philistines carry on against Jehovah’s witnesses “by revenge” and “with a despiteful heart” and “hatred”, exactly as the ancient Philistines did against God’s chosen people in Palestine.—Ezek. 25:15.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“AGREEMENT WITH HELL”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Although the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the modern Philistines, have induced millions of people to believe that such institution represents God and Christ on earth, yet that wicked organization proceeds exactly contrary to the Word of God. Jehovah’s prophets warn the peoples of earth concerning the day of Armageddon and what great destruction the Lord will then bring upon the wicked at that time. The Hierarchy, with pious face and sanctimonious words, harangue the people and claim that these prophecies concerning Armageddon are not true, and especially with reference to the Catholic organization. As an example, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Freeman’s Journal</span><span class="font5"> of May 1935, published at Sydney, Australia, says concerning these prophets and of Jehovah’s witnesses: “The burden of their message is that all political and ecclesiastical organizations are under the control of Satan, Catholics being the more under the diabolical thumb than Protestants; that God is about to smite the lot, Catholic and Protestant; to escape ultimate annihilation men have to become Jehovah’s witnesses. ... I could scarcely blame the people if they preferred ultimate annihilation. However, there is no need to choose either; in fact, ultimate annihilation is an impossibility.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>42</sup> The Roman Catholic Hierarchy is made up of scornful and arrogant men who are proud and haughty, who in the place of God’s sure Word of prophecy substitute the theories and teachings of the Catholic organization, and by it the people are deceived and oppressed, as pictured by prophecy of the Israelites at Jerusalem. To such arrogant and scornful modern Philistines Jehovah now says: “Wherefore hear the word of the Lord, ye scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem: because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us; for wo have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves. Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste. Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place. And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.”—Isa. 28:14-18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>43</sup> The prophecies of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Amos concerning the Philistines were written long after the ancient Philistines, as a nation, were destroyed; -which is conclusive proof that those prophecies refer to the people whom the ancient Philistines foreshadowed or pictured. The overwhelming evidence shows that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy exactly fits the picture made by the ancient Philistines; otherwise stated, the Hierarchy constitutes the modern Philistines. Pretending to have come out of the world and onto the side of the Lord, and to be consecrated to God and Christ Jesus, they are in fact assuming the false position or place of the followers of Christ Jesus, who are hence symbolically in the “land of Judah”. Circumcision, as used under the law of God, is a symbol of full consecration and devotion to Jehovah. The Scriptures frequently denounced in terms of contempt the Philistines as “the uncircumcised”. (See Judges 14:3; 15:18; 1 Sam. 14:6; 17:26; 2 Sam. 1:20.) This is proof that the Philistines pictured a class of people or organization doomed to disgrace. The Philistines furthermore pictured a class marked for disgrace, in this, that God smote the Philistines with a disease of emerods, which in modern language means hemorrhoids, that is to say, tumors in the hinder parts. “And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the Lord was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[{Septuagint</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Vulgate)</span><span class="font5"> And the men of Gath (consulted together, and) made themselves seats (of skins).]”—1 Sam. 5:9.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">** The uncircumcised Philistines wanted to keep the Israelites in subjection in order to get pecuniary gain. The modern uncircumcised Philistines, the Roman Catholic organization, want to destroy God’s people and keep all the other people in subjection in order to reap pecuniary gain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>45</sup> The claim that the pope is the successor of the apostle Peter is false as the Devil himself. Christ Jesus says: ‘‘My kingdom is not of this world.” (John 18:36) The Roman Catholic Hierarchy says, “It is our right to rule and control this world.” Jesus said that Satan is the ruler or invisible prince of this world, and this shows that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is the agent of Satan. (John 12:31; 2 Cor. 4:4) The Roman Catholic Hierarchy not only is a friend of the world of Satan, but forms an integral part thereof, and for that reason alone that wicked organization could not represent God, but is in fact God’s enemy; The words of the apostle James specifically apply to that wicked organization: “Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.” (Jas. 4:4) ‘Adultery,’ as used in this text, means a claim made by men of an organization to represent God and at the same time consorting with and forming a part of the wicked world. That the Roman Catholic Hierarchy constitutes the modern Philistines and is the chief enemy of God and his kingdom, there is not the slightest doubt, and God’s promise is that by the hand of the antitypical David, Christ Jesus, he will save his people out of the hands of these enemies. (2 Sam. 3: IS) What, then, is the fate or complete end of the modern Philistines? This question is now of greatest importance to all who love Jehovah.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark5"></a>THE TWO SIDES AT ARMAGEDDON</span></h1>
<p><span class="font11">J</span><span class="font5">ERUSALEM is a name applied to the people of God who are consecrated to him and who have been begotten by his spirit and thus been brought forth as his sons. The name “Zion” applies to the “Jerusalem” class as those who are not merely consecrated but who are fully devoted to the Lord and his cause because of love for him and an appreciation of their privileges and who are made God’s capital organization. These are designated in the Scriptures as the ‘overcoming’ class. Of the overcoming class, who have the promise of being for ever with the Lord, there will be only one hundred and forty-four thousand; and doubtless the major portion of these have already passed into heavenly glory, while the minority remain on the earth waiting for the consummation of their hopes. These are “the remnant” against which Satan the enemy makes war, and he attempts to destroy them because they keep the commandments of God and have the testimony^ of Jesus Christ.—Rev. 12:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As the enemy and his hosts view the little company who are faithfully bearing witness to the name of God, and hear what these witnesses say, they laugh them to scorn. The clergy, the false prophets, together with the principal of their church flocks, make extravagant claims for their organizations and point the finger of disgust toward those who now proclaim the name of God and his incoming kingdom. So small are the numbers who appear to be on the Lord’s side, so great and powerful are the numbers on the enemy’s side, and so extravagant are the claims made by the false prophets of the enemy’s camp, that all except the very elect of God will be deceived to some extent. (Matt. 2-1:24) The false prophets will tell the people that the present institutions will stand eternally, and that they and their allies have been commissioned to establish God’s kingdom on earth; and that this they are now doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But the elect, “the remnant of [Zion’s] seed,’’ will not be at all deceived by the extravagant claims, the threats, the persecutions, the brandishing of arms or any exhibition of Satan’s power. They will remember that the Philistine giant Goliath, the representative of Satan, defied the army of the Lord and fell at the hands of the shepherd lad David, who was there a type of the Lord Jesus Christ.—1 Sam. 17: 48, 49.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This “little flock’’ will call to mind how the Assyrian king Sennacherib long ago stood before the walls of ancient Jerusalem, arrogantly claiming to be greater than Jehovah God, defying Jehovah and blaspheming his holy name, and how the angel of the Lord swept away Sennacherib’s army in one night.—2 Ki. 19:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This little company of faithful Christians will remember how Pharaoh of Egypt, who was the visible representative of Satan the enemy, pursued the people of God with the Egyptian army and would have crushed the Israelites, but that the Lord utterly destroyed Pharaoh and his army in the Red sea.—Ex. 14:27-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This little company of faithful Christians will also call to mind how Jehoshaphat, king of Jerusalem and a representative of the Lord God, was beset by the armies of Ammon, Moab and Mount Scir, corresponding to the three elements composing Satan’s organization at the present time, namely, Big Business, big politics and big religion; and how the Lord put his hand over his own people and shielded them, while he drove the enemy’s army into destruction.—2 Chronicles 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why did God cause these things to be recorded in his Word? The evident purpose was and is to show how he can make himself a name when he so desires, and to encourage and strengthen the faith of his people and cause them to trust him implicitly in the time of great peril. To such he has said: “ 0 love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.’’—Ps. 31:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On one side of what the prophet Joel calls “the valley of decision” (Joel 3:14), and in the valley, stands the tremendous army of Satan the enemy, defying God, uttering cries of derision, and threatening to feed the fowls of the air upon the flesh of those who have come out against them to declare the name of the Lord. On the other side of the valley, and high up the mountainside facing to the east, stands the little company of faithful servants of the Lord, small in number and weak in individual power; yet they never for one moment quail before the enemy. They are smiling; they are happy; yea, they are even joyful; and together they lift up their voices in song, saying: Jehovah is God; Christ Jesus is King; the kingdom of heaven is at hand; the day of deliverance has come! Jehovah God is saying to them, as recorded in Isaiah’s prophecy (43:12,11): “Ye are my witnesses . . . that I am God. I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The contrast between the numbers in the enemy’s visible army and the apparent numbers in the army of the Lord is so great that only a very few are able to see that the enemy’s organization will be destroyed. It seems quite apparent that for the special encouragement of the faithful Christians now on earth God long ago caused to be recorded the following picture relating to the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehoshaphat was a faithful king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat represented the Lord God. Ammon, Moab and Mount Scir entered into a conspiracy against Jehoshaphat and the people of Jerusalem. They camo up to assault Jerusalem. Jehoshaphat prayed to God. His prayer is a pathetic one, and fitly pictures the utter helplessness of men and the complete dependence of the Christian upon Jehovah. While Jehoshaphat prayed the Lord sent him a message, to wit: “Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat; Thus saith the Lord unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s. Tomorrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jerucl. Yc shall not need to fight in this battle; set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the Lord with you, 0 Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dis-maj'ed; tomorrow go out against them; for the Lord will be with you. And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the Lord, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the Lord; for his mercy endureth for ever. And when they began to sing and to praise, the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.”—2 Chron. 20:15-17,21,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The history of sixty centuries is behind us. Upon every page of it appear the marks of Satan, the enemy. In all that time he has reproached God, defied him and turned the people away from him. God has permitted it, as he permitted Pharaoh of old to remain on the throne of Egypt, eventually to show his power over Pharnch. (Ex. 9:16) He has promised that the time will come when he will put an end to this fraudulent deception of the people, and that he will open the eyes of the people and deliver them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The hour has arrived when God will send forth his beloved Son as Field Marshal, to lead the fight against the .nations of earth composing the Devil’s organization. It is God’s fight; but he acts through his beloved Son, whom he has placed upon the throne and who is the priest of the Most High God. (Ps. 110:2,4) In this great conflict Jehovah is the right-hand support of his beloved Son. He delights in him because he is his faithful servant. (Isa. 42:1) To him he says (as recorded in the forty-fifth Psalm, verses two to four): “Thou art fairer than the children of men; grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, 0 most Mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty. And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In times past the prophets of God were granted visions of the preparation for the great battle and the going into action. Ilabakkuk the prophet saw the Devil’s organization assembled and, to the nations composing that organization who practice the devil religion through worship of images, including the League of Nations, he says: “What profiteth the graven image, that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols? Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach 1 Behold, it is laid over with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.”—Hab. 2:18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then the prophet calls the attention of the people to the purpose of the great war. He says: “But the Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.”—Hab. 2:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jeremiah was given a vision of the day of God’s wrath, and he wrote: “But the Lord is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting King: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.” (Jer. 10:10) “Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The Lord [Jehovah] shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation ; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth. A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth: for the Lord hath a controversy with the nations; he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the Lord.”—Jer. 25:30,31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Joel the prophet saw the army assembled in the valley of judgment, the valley of decision where the great issue “Who is God?” is to be finally decided in favor of Jehovah the Most High; and he expressed this prophecy: “Put ye in the sickle; for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the press is full, the [vats] overflow; for their wickedness is great. Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the Lord [Jehovah] is near in the valley of decision. The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining. The Lord also shall roar out of Zion [his organization], and utter his voice from Jeiaisalcm [his universal organization] ; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the Lord will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel. So shall ye know that I am the Lord your God dwelling in Zion.”— Joel 3:13-17.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark7"></a>SATAN’S REPRESENTATIVES REPROVED</span></h1>
<p><span class="font11">G</span><span class="font5">OD was displeased with the three professed friends of Job because they did not speak the truth. To “friend” Eliphaz the Temanite the Lord said: “My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.” (Job 42:7) The words of Jehovah here show that Job, a man of no pretensions, came nearer to speaking the truth, and spoke much of the truth, whereas the three professed friends of Job, who claimed to speak in the name of the Lord, did not utter the truth. How well the facts that have eome to pass since that time fit the picture! The representatives of the Devil’s visible organization have claimed to speak in the name of Jehovah God. The clergy and their allies and the principal of their flocks have posed as the sole teachers of the Lord’s Word and as guides and advisers of the people. They have not spoken the truth, while many good honest men of the land who have desired to know the truth have found and spoken some truth, the latter being pictured by Job. The ecclesiastical systems have builded great and imposing structures which they call “churches”; they have installed therein costly furnishings; they have caused to preside over these places the so-called ‘great and mighty doctors of divinity’; they have made the financiers and the professional politicians who rule to be the principal members of the congregation; and in these houses called “churches” the clergy have expressed their great “wisdom” and claimed to represent the Lord. They have in fact represented the Devil, because it is the Devil’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is true, doubtless, that many of these ecclesiastical organizations started out with the avowed purpose of serving God; but they soon fell victims to the Devil; and the Lord caused his •witnesses to ■write concerning such, and his words apply specifically to this day. (Jer. 2:21-23) Babylon and Belial are the names of the Devil’s organization; and the ecclesiastical systems being a part thereof, the Lord says of and concerning the same: “And what concord hath Christ with Belial ? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and 1 will be their God, and they shall be my people. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.”—2 Cor. 6:15-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In fact “Christendom”, so called, is a social and political organization, operated chiefly by the owners of great wealth, professional politicians who carry on their selfish, nefarious work, and the clergy who pose as God’s representatives and urge the people to faithfully support and uphold such organization. Many good men and women who desire to know of God’s Word of truth are wholly in bondage to those ecclesiastical systems. Elihu pictures a class whose privilege it is to inform them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What is said here with reference to the Catholic and “Protestant” systems applies with equal force to the Jewish synagogues. No longer are the people therein taught by the rabbis the Word of God as written and recorded by his holy prophets. They have substituted the words of the “fathers”, so called, even as the “three friends” of Job advised Job he should study and follow such. These, as well as the “Protestant” churches, form a part of “Christendom”, for the reason that the word “Christendom” is a misnomer. It is intended to be used to represent Christ’s kingdom, but is in fact a subterfuge to blind the people. It is really the Devil’s organization. There is no part of so-called “Christendom” that is teaching or making any attempt to teach the people God’s purpose to give man life on earth by redemption, resurrection and the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God's anointed class, sometimes called Jehovah’s witnesses, and which class was pictured by Elihu, is the only class of people under the sun who today are magnifying the name of Jehovah God and who give to him the glory and are not giving glory and honor to men. These are telling the people of God’s way that leads man to life and happiness. There is every reason why this anointed and faithful servant class should rejoice and sing for joy, because of the privilege granted unto them to declare the name, majesty and loving-kindness of the Almighty God, and tell the people how their relief and blessings are coming through his kingdom. Never did man enjoy a greater privilege on earth than is now enjoyed by those who take a delight in being the witnesses for Jehovah God and in speaking to those who will hear and in telling them about God’s great arrangement for the salvation of humankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It will be seen that the speech of Elihu was chiefly for the purpose of magnifying, and did magnify, the name of Jehovah. His testimony tells of the power of Jehovah, indicates the overthrow of the enemy’s organization, and tells of God’s vindication by his Kingdom under Christ Jesus, and the regeneration of obedient men thereafter. The voice is used as a symbol of a message. It is the servant class of the Lord that together lift up the voice, that is to say, harmoniously proclaim the words and message of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “lightning” is a representation of the illumination of God’s Word, which he gives forth through the Head of his anointed class. In his speech Elihu said: “Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth. He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.” (Job 37:2,3) Thus he indicates that the message of truth, illuminated by the “lightning” of the Lord and under his direction, will go to the ends of the earth as a witness to the nations and people. Then he says: “After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard. God thun-dercth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend. Out of the south cometh the whirlwind; and cold out of the north. He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy. Hearken unto this, 0 Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God. And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds; but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them. Fair weather cometh out of the noith: with God is terrible majesty.”—Job 37: 4, 5, 9,13,14, 21, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In substance, Elihu here pictures a time when a strenuous and forceful witness would be given to the peoples and nations of the earth, telling of God, his excellency and his mighty purpose for the salvation of men; also telling of an approaching storm, the great trouble which is expressive of the indignation of God against Satan’s organization; also indicating that immediately following this witness, or even while it is in progress, the great storm or whirlwind breaks with terrific fury upon the earth, and that it passes and cleanses the earth, and then fair weather cometh out of the north. These words of Elihu foreshadow a great witness to the peoples of earth followed by the time of trouble, at the end of which Kingdom blessings would begin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus is indicated the time when the anointed servant class on earth must give a testimony concerning the majesty of God, his purpose of destroying Satan’s organization, and the bringing of life to the people thiough his government over which his beloved and anointed Son presides. The facts show that the anointed servant class is now giving that very testimony to the peoples of earth in obedience to God’s commandments, and that this must be done before the great whirlwind of Jehovah’s war breaks upon the nations of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The World War of 1914 to 1918, and the associated incidents, mark the fulfillment of the prophecy concerning the end of the world. (Matthew 24:7-22) That means that 1914 marked the time when the period of Christ’s waiting at God’s right hand would end and when the period of his activity would begin against Satan and his organization. (Ps. 110:1,2) In verse fourteen of the above-cited chapter of Matthew it is said that then must follow the testimony of the good news to the peoples of earth, to wit, that, the world has ended and the time of God’s kingdom is at hand; and that this testimony must be given as a witness to the nations. Verses twenty-one and twenty-two of that same chapter state that then shall follow a time of trouble such as the world has never known and that this will be the last. That time of trouble is undoubtedly otherwise described by the prophets of the Lord as the battle of God Almighty. (Rev. 16:14) That will be the battle of God Almighty against Satan’s organization, and will mark the complete overthrow of Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is another reason why the servant class now on earth should rejoice to sing forth the praises of Jehovah’s name and to declare his works among the people. (Isa. 12:1-5) The physical facts that are now in progress in fulfillment of prophecy arc further proof that Elihu represented a class that would be privileged to understand the prophecy at this time. God conceals the understanding of his prophecy until his own due time to permit it to be known. His people have not heretofore understood the book of Job; but now in the light of the unfolding of the divine purpose it becomes clear, and all honor and glory is given to the name of God. The revelation of the book of Job to God’s people is another evidence that we are rapidly approaching the great battle of Almighty God and, after it, the blessings of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As Elihu concluded his testimony, the whirlwind broke in all its fury. Such is a symbol of God’s expressed indignation against Satan’s organization. Concerning this the Lord caused his prophet to write: “For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city [organized ‘Christendom’] which is called by my name [‘Christendom’ claims the name of the Lord, but in fact represents the Devil], and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the Lord of hosts. Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The Lord shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation ; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation ; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth. A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the Lord hath a controversy with the nations; he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the Lord. Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground. Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.’’—.Jeremiah 25:29-35.</span></p>
