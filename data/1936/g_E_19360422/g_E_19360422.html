<p><span class="font4">In </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The New Republic,</span><span class="font4"> October 30, 1935, Harold J. Laski, economist and educator, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I know of no country in the world where Hitler’s success could be so easily repeated as in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The drift to Fascism is plainly shown in the Townsend plan.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>New Proposal to Destroy State Governments</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font4">HE newest proposal to destroy state governments, now<sup>7</sup> that the NRA has gone overboard, is to establish ten viceroyalties throughout the United States; in other words, break the United States up into ten units, all working under the one head at Washington. This is so palpably Fascist that it can come to nothing unless Congress has entirely lost its head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Splitting the United States into ten federal districts it is proposed that New England would be one district, with Boston as its obvious capital; most of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania a second, with New York city as its capital; Maryland, Delaware, Virginia and North Carolina, with Washington as its capital; South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Alabama, with Atlanta as its capital; Ohio, West Virginia, Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee, with Cincinnati as its capital; Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas, with New Orleans as its capital; Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota, with Chicago as its capital; New Mexico, Arizona, California, Nevada and Utah, with Los Angeles as its capital; Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska and Wyoming, with Denver as its capital; and North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Oregon and Washington, with Portland, Oregon, as its capital. State lines would be largely ignored. The object is to destroy the states as such. The Jesuits have the United States divided into seven districts. A favorite method of dictators is to redistrict the land, so as to confuse and distract the people. A proposal to destroy the states was made the day the plan was announced.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>Take a Look at the Devil</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">THIS country is fully developed industrially. -*• The railroads are built, the cities are built, the highways are largely built, practically all major projects of development have been completed, and in addition to these recovery deterrents world markets are largely gone, for ever. What then, has private capitalism failed? Well, we have now passed to state capitalism, and the profit system is supported by state subsidy, which is the economic essence of Fascism, copied from Italy, a great “Christian” nation, now engaged in mass murder of and theft from a helpless people. Now then, if you like to look at pictures and want to see a true likeness of Satan the Devil, take a look at Mussolini; then if you wish to see different facial expressions of the same creature take a look at Hitler and a squint at Stalin. Finally, give the United States of America a sweeping once-over, and if you do not see the subtle influence of this invisible overlord working overtime in this country you are blind. I thank you.—J. Howe, in the Mason City (Iowa) </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Globe Gazette.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Red Book</span><span class="font4"> for February, 1935, told the story of the employment by this administration, using the taxpayers’ money, of one hundred outstanding journalists to sell the New Deal to this country. Everything was colored at headquarters at Washington to attain this end in the same way that the farmers of the country have been deceived by the horde of paid administration employees to sell the AAA plan to them. In other words, our own money is being used to destroy us. The menace which faces this country is Fascism, and the plans of the New Dealers, if realized, will make President Roosevelt the dictator in a land which for 150 years has been free from such influence.—E. N. Sanctuary, New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Dr. Harry Elmer Barnes, in an address in New York, indicating how he thinks Fascism will come in the United States, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We are likely to have a bullish pickup of business and stocks for the next two years, with another depression thereafter. Then discontent will arise, force will be used against the labor movement, civil liberties will practically disappear, and then Sinclair Lewis’ “Minute Men” will be herding us into concentration camps. If anyone doubts this, let him look about him and see that certain characteristics of Fascism are already among us. The American Legion prides itself on being the leading opponent of civil liberties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Governor George H. Earle, of Pennsylvania, in an address before the American Legion at Wilkes-Barre, repeated General Butler’s charges that wealthy men in America are seeking Fascism, to divert attention from the fact that here is starvation in the midst of plenty, and millions on relief rolls in the richest country in the world. He said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If we consider the number of people in this country at 100, and our wealth at $100, we find that one person has $59, one has $9, 22 have approximately $1.26 each, and 76 have only 7 cents each. When such a state of affairs exists, anything is possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Government is considering a penal colony on the Rat islands, at the tip of the Aleutians, far east of the International Date Line, some 800 miles off Kamchatka. The climate is good for rats, averaging 39 degrees in winter and 54 in summer. The proposition is to dump on the islands all male prisoners who are sentenced to over five years, provide them with shelter and a minimum amount of foodstuffs, and go off and leave them. By comparison, Mussolini’s penal islands would be resorts.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>Interviewing the Secretary’s Secretary</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">R</span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">esident Roosevelt had just returned from his fishing trip, so we went to call on him. Police eyed us sternly in the reception room of the White House. Newspaper reporters swarmed out of a press conference. We asked for an interview with the president. We were told we could see his secretary, Mr. McIntyre. Finally we saw Mr. McIntyre’s secretary. We told him about the terrible living conditions in the Black Belt of Alabama, about wages of $1 to $3 a week for 70 or more hours of work and wages of 35 cents per 100 pounds for picking cotton; we told how t h e Share-Croppers’ Union had called the strike of the cotton pickers to win $1 per 100 pounds for picking cotton and $1 a day for wage hands.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">LOST</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">Then we told him about High Sheriff R. E. Woodruff of Lowndes Countyshooting four times at Willie ■Witcher, Negro strike leader in Calhoun, beating him over the head with a pistol, and throwing him into jail for twenty-seven days. That was on August 19. We explained how a lynch mob organized by Sheriff Woodruff had carried six strike leaders out of their beds that night and beaten them almost to death in the swamps. We told how, a few days later, Smith Watkins, a Negro leader of the union, was caught by the mob, his stomach ripped open with knives, his body riddled with bullets and thrown into the swamps near Fort Deposit. Also we told him how Jim Press Meriwether, a Negro striker, had walked into his sister’s home with a sack of flour and had been shot down by John Frank Bates of Fort Deposit, one of a gang of lynchers who had taken over the house; and how this lynch mob had carried the dying man to C. C. Ryles’s plantation to question him as he lay in the hot sun for more than six hours, then hung him to a limb and riddled his body with about a hundred bullets. Mrs. Meriwether told how part of the same mob came to the place where she was staying, and how Vaughn Ryles and Ralph McGuire stripped her naked and whipped her with a rope until her legs were cut and bleeding, and how they hung her to the rafters until she was unconscious—later they drove her away from the place. We told him that on Labor Day a mob headed by Deputy Sheriff Ed Arant of Fort Deposit raided the home of Ed Bracy, county leader of the union, and shot him nineteen times in the neck and head as he tried to escape through the back door. We also told him about the three unidentified, bullet-riddled bodies of Negro strikers found in the swamps around Fort Deposit and Calhoun—and that no inquest was held to identify the bodies. All of this, we told him, had happened merely because the workers used their constitutional right to strike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The official smile on the President's secretary's secretary's face faded as we proceeded with the story. We told him that Governor Graves had sent Kyle Young, former high sheriff of Tallapoosa County and leader of the lynch mob against the share-croppers in Camp Hill in 1931, to investigate the strike with bloodhounds from Prison Camp No. 4, and that the investigation ended with the running down of strike leaders in the swamps.—Thomas Burke, in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Nation.</span></p>

<div><img src="g_E_19360422_files/g_E_19360422-4.png" alt="" style="width:16pt;height:18pt;">

<p><span class="font4">READERS will recall the Battle of Anacostia, where President Hoover won lasting fame by ordering out the full power of the United States Army to chase some few hundreds of sick and poverty-stricken veterans out of the capital environs when they came on to Washington to demand the bonus admitted to be their</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">due. Subsequently, in 1935, another attempt was made to get their dues, and, to keep them quiet and get them out of the way, hundreds were loaded on the cars and sent to the Florida Keys in midsummer. When the big storm came along 442 of them were blown into eternity. Thirty-six were burned in one funeral pyre. The bodies of others, by presidential order, were buried in Arlington National Cemetery, euphemistically described as the &quot;graveyard of the nation’s hero warriors”. The presidents of the United States are commanders in chief of the army and navy of the United States, and it must be admitted that both Herbert Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt won great military and financial victories over these sick and indigent warriors, but it all came out lovely in the end, for they are buried in Arlington, even if they didn’t get their bonus. The worms in Arlington are the most high-class worms in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Arbitraloi</span><span class="font4"> makes it warm for President Roosevelt by quoting his speeches of 1932, made before he was elected to take Hoover’s place. One of these gems is the following, especially rich in view of the fact that Mr. Roosevelt in three years expended as much as previous presidents expended in the first 124 years of America's national existence. Here is what Mr. Roosevelt said of Mr. Hoover’s administration: “I accuse the present administration of being the greatest spending administration in peacetime, in all our history—one which has piled bureau on bureau, commission on commission, and has failed to anticipate the dire needs of reduced earning power of the people.” Twenty days later, and ; till before his election, Mr. Roosevelt, quoth </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Arbitrator,</span><span class="font4"> went on to say: <sup>"I regard reduction in federal spending as one of the most important issues in this campaign. In my opinion it is the most direct and effective contribution that government can make to business.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The day after the Supreme Court declared the NRA measure unconstitutional I had the privilege of lunching with President Roosevelt. His health could not have been better, but his statements outlining his plans were most disturbing, and, if known, would shock every staunch American. My investigations of the political trend has convinced me that the people are beginning to recognize the president’s broken promises; his assault on the Constitution and his intimation that he would ‘pack’ the United States Supreme Court; I am also convinced that our citizens have now awakened to the fact that the New Deal Administration is not an American administration, not a Democratic administration, but a group of men who, perhaps innocently, but at least ignorantly, are trying to create one national State, with a regimentation not only of business and agriculture, but of the people themselves. And all this means Fascism mixed with Communism.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Great Britain, France, Russia and the United States are also guilty.

Among the nations any government may perpetrate, in the name of patriotism, acts that are forbidden to individuals. A nation may invade the territory of another, steal its property, rape its women and despoil its buildings without breaking any law. To keep their record clean, they sometimes declare war, which makes any atrocity legal. The absence of international law grants freedom to national criminals and leaves the world in anarchy.</span></p>

There is nothing human, nothing civilized, nothing chivalrous, nothing heroic left in the old game of war. It is now, with modern equipment, simply mass murder.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>CCC Military Training Camps</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">THE United States Government is getting ready for Armageddon. Some of the signs are the largest peacetime appropriations in history for the army and navy, the moving of gold, munitions and basic army supplies to forts in the interior, the rebuilding of the air fleet, and the admission that the CCC has really been training hundreds of thousands of young men for military ends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For reasons unknown, the CCC is building a huge war cantonment at Camp Pike, Arkansas. It is conjectured that this is one of the items in Senator Nye’s charges that the United States at present is spending more money in preparation for war than any other country in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Fearing military discipline, and possibly military training, 214 young men in Fort Worth, Texas, and all in need of work, refused to enroll in the CCC, despite the fact that they would receive clothing, subsistence, shelter, medical care, educational advantages and $30 to $45 per month wages. A mother writes that conditions at Graham, Texas, in the CCC camp there, were such that a mother going there in a car to visit her son was not allowed to get out of the car. This happened twice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is quite a job being responsible for a half million Americans in the CCC camps, but Americans will be surprised to learn that one of the chief jobs in that connection is to prevent them from discussing anything. Director Robert Fechner not only rejected educational pamphlets that would tell the youths something about unemployment and strikes, but has provided the instructors with directions how to thwart controversy, telling them that when “dangerous issues” arise the subjects are to be postponed, forgotten or forbidden. This was probably copied out of some book of instructions written by Adolf Hitler for guidance of the German Youth. The obvious result is that after a sufficient length of time in the CCC service, the half million youths will all be as alike as peas in a pod, and without the courage or capacity to express individual ideas on any subject.</span></p>

June 8, 1915, he resigned. September 6, 1915, Robert Lansing, secretary of state in Bryan’s place, proposed to Wilson, the man that “kept us out of the war”, that America should loan money to the Allies. (America had already been loaning credit.) Two days later, without putting it in black and white, Wilson agreed to Lansing’s proposals, and thus committed the United States to the World War 14 months before he was re-elected because he “kept us out of the war”. The British Government tried its best to prevent the publication of these facts, but they have now come out. Wilson was a traitor to his country.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The American people would not have supported the last war if they had had a chance to vote on it.

<p><span class="font11">L</span><span class="font4">OVERS of the Federal Constitution should be thankful for a Supreme Court that is able to understand and define it and have the honesty and courage to uphold it. The Constitution is the only bar between executive and dictator, between a government of the people and a dictatorship. When a Congress can pass an act as vicious as the AAA proved to be, with no way left to challenge it, a dictator would be useful only to simplify proceedings. It seems that what was called a liberal construction in the</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">AAA decision would in that case make the Constitution of none effect. In their amendments to the Constitution, the people should spare no pains to safeguard the principles of justice, equality and individual liberty. It would be impossible under present conditions of special interest and graft to write and have ratified a document as impartial. Many laws on the statute books are there, no doubt, because their validity has never been challenged. Wisdom would dictate that laws passed by Congress be passed on by the Supreme Court before being placed on the law books. Had that been done with New Deal legislation, billions of tax money would have been saved to the people, and a grain of prestige left to the Congress that passed them. The comical side of the New Deal is that Congress by their own fiat tried to make unconstitutional laws constitutional. Secretary Wallace started out trying to regulate the packers ; the packers, it now seems, wind up with the full amount of money they collected from the people, to pay processing taxes with, in their pockets. The administration started in to regulate the banks. The banks, by next June, will invoice sixteen billion dollars or more of new bonds; with ten billions of gold, and the treasury only knows how many billions of currency (of doubtful ownership) all in a jackpot. On with the game; the sky is the limit. This has all been accomplished by fighting the packers and the banks. What could have been done if they had all pulled together? Another comic was Secretary Wallace and a few other white-collar farmers trying to regulate production to the needs of consumers, when about 50 percent of the average yield depends on the weather and about 49 percent on the way the crop is tended. Of course, the secretary could not do much about the way the hired man plowed corn, and less about the weather, but what he did about the other 1 percent was a plenty and is now history. I forgot to mention how magnanimous Congress was in delegating to the executive powers which it did not possess. Secretary Wallace says the AAA is not dead; maybe not, but it smells like it.—A. H.

If you will consider what this government has done for the silver speculators, the farmers, the labor unions, the stockholders in bond-burdened enterprises and other special groups, you will realize that it does not surrender to the mob but, on the contrary, to very substantial special interests quite apart from the mob. The worst that can be said of the present administration is that by vague promises to remove economic distress and social inequality it has encouraged the masses of the people to embrace any fool scheme presented to them. It has sowed the seed from which has sprung a whole crop of rabble-rousers, the most vehement, noisy, conspicuous and colorful in American history.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Billions have been spent and not even one unemployed person out of ten has been given a temporary job through the present government policy of spending. The total unemployed is now greater than in October, 1933, when the Public Works program began. The expenditure of approximately $2,500,000,000 in the three years of this program has resulted in the employment of less than 700,000 annually. Instead of creating sorely needed confidence, recent Government policies seem deliberately calculated to destroy it.

Douglas, former director of the Budget. Referring to the anticipated collapse of the credit of the Government, Mr. Douglas says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When this happens we will experience a bankrupt banking system, for it now holds approximately 60 percent of the Government debt, and a bankrupt Federal Reserve System, for it now holds almost $2,500,000,000 of Government obligations.

Then the turbines are stopped, and the gates are opened and remain so until the common level has fallen as low as it will. The gates are then closed as the waters begin again to rise. Continuous power is obtained by pumping ocean water to the top of a high hill, into a large reservoir. Withdrawals from this reservoir can be made continuously at any rate desired.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A five-minute talk</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">l)y Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font4">HE seventh chapter of Revelation identifies the 144,000 commissioned ones who constitute the church of God, and then adds these words: 'After this I beheld a great multitude, of all nations, that stood before the throne, clothed with white robes, with palms in their hands, and they cried: Salvation unto our God and unto the Lamb.’ The book of Revelation is written in sign or symbolic language. This great multitude standing before the throne clothed in white robes means that they have received the approval of God and of Christ and therefore have a standing in righteousness. They have taken their stand firmly on the side of God and His kingdom, and the waving of the palm branches means that they are hailing Christ as King, exactly as the multitude did when Jesus rode into Jerusalem. They say that salvation is of God through Christ Jesus; and thus they attribute all salvation to the Lord, and not to man or any man-made institutions. They are for God and His kingdom. Such are the people of good will toward God and Christ, and for that reason they are at peace with God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Further describing this great multitude the scripture reads: “These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.” Other scriptures show that from the end of the World War forward the true followers of Christ Jesus must give a wide testimony or witness to the truth, and that such witness work will be accomplished amidst persecution of the witnesses, and that at the end of the witness work the greatest tribulation of all time will come upon the world. It is during that time that the great multitude of people come out from worldly organizations, separate themselves unto the Lord, take their stand on His side, and faithfully serve Him. They are not made clean by reason of the tribulation, but are made clean by reason of their faith in the shed blood of Christ Jesus, the Lamb of God, and this is symbolically shown by the washing of their robes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The throne of God pictures the divine seat of authority vested in Christ Jesus. The great multitude are before the throne, meaning that they have their faces and hearts set toward the kingdom of God under Christ, and joyfully acknowledge that He is the only means of salvation. They become servants of the Lord and gladly serve as the Scriptures here state: “They serve him day and night,” which means that they serve Him all the time, and serve the Devil none of the time. They serve the Lord by telling others of Him and His kingdom. They are not the anointed witnesses of Jehovah, yet they bear testimony to the name of God and maintain their integrity toward Him. At Revelation 22:17 the record is that Christ Jesus, the great spirit, and His bride, the body members of the church, say to the people who will hear, ‘Come and learn the truth and receive salvation.’ The great multitude hear the message of good news, take their stand with Jehovah’s witnesses, and join in saying also, ‘Come and learn the way to life.’ Those of the great multitude were also pictured by Jonadab, who joined himself to Jehu, who pictured the Lord Jesus. During the past few years more than two hundred million books containing the good news of the Kingdom have been placed in the hands of the people, and millions of people have learned of Jehovah and His kingdom. Now we behold the great multitude coming from all nations and peoples of the earth taking their stand on the side of God and His kingdom and serving Him. Christ is the world’s rightful Ruler, and henceforth He is the Lord and Leader of the great multitude and He shall feed them on His truth and lead them into everlasting life. They will not go to heaven, but they constitute the millions now living on earth that will not die. For them God made the earth, and by His grace they will dwell forever on the earth in peace and everlasting joy. Let all persons who desire life everlasting now hasten to learn of God and His kingdom under Christ. That much-needed information is contained in the books that Jehovah's witnesses now bring to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the battle of the great day of God Almighty, will those of the great multitude die ? Some of them may, but if they are faithful they will be awakened out of death and resurrected shortly thereafter. God has promised those who are of the great multitude, and who are now diligent in seeking meekness and righteousness, that they may he hid and protected and carried through Armageddon. It is therefore very important for all of those who are Jonadabs, or of the great multitude, that they now be diligent in studying the Scriptures and helps which God has provided for them and to also be diligent and active in telling others about God and His kingdom. Faithfulness will be required of the great multitude because only the faithful God approves.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark177"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark178"></a>Australasian Report to Judge Rutherford</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">E</span><span class="font4">VERYTHING in connection with the broadcast in Australia shows the hand of Almighty God in accomplishing the impossible from a human point of view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To speed up the postmaster general in giving a decision, a messenger was sent to interview him personally, and his reply was that the speech could not be broadcast without first seeing the script, and furthermore, if the script was departed from, it would be cut off. They promised to write to us embodying their decision, but, instead, they wrote to the Amalgamated Wireless (Australia) Ltd. (who handled the relay in Australia), stating that if we would give them an undertaking stating that the speech would not contain anything offensive, permission would be granted for the broadcast. As the truth is not offensive, but the greatest benefit to humanity, such an undertaking was not difficult to give.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The technical experts both in London and in Australia were dubious about any signals at all being heard in Australia between 6 and 7 a.m. So certain did they appear that they wanted a guarantee from us to pay the charges for the whole hour if the broadcast was a failure. This we gave to them, and at the last moment they made a similar request that we give them this guarantee through the A.W.A. Ltd., apparently desiring that A.W.A. would be held responsible in the event of default on our part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of the office staff went to 2UE, the key station in Sydney, at 5:30 a.m. on Monday morning, February 24. From there they heard the testing going on, and the instructions being given by the British Post Office officials for the connecting of the cities in Britain, instructions regarding the cue for opening and closing, and request for a report as to the reception in Australia. Then they crossed over to the Shrine Auditorium, when we were thrilled to hear the friends in session singing the song “Hail to the Lord’s Anointed”—this while the testing was going in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the lecture came through it was marvelously clear, and the crushing blows dealt to the modern Philistines were thoroughly appreciated. Towards the end a little static was in evidence, but not sufficiently bad to make the speech unintelligible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On returning to Strathfield, the Post Office called us, asking for our report on the speech, and it was then they told us that at 7 a.m., when the speech was completed, the circuit from London completely failed, and so sudden was the close-down that they could not get their report back to London concerning the quality of the reception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Such an evidence of the direction of the Great and Supreme Jehovah God was thrilling to us, because we see in it the evidence of His complete control of the radio, which absolutely belongs to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There was no reported interference with the broadcast at any of the stations. No doubt the government officials were so satisfied that it would be a failure that they did not bother to check up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Regarding the Geelong trouble: We succeeded in winning the case there, and we do not think there will be any more trouble in connection with the transcription work in that city. We enclose herewith a quotation from the report of the matter in Geelong.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark179"></a>Amusing Case in Geelong, Australia</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">E</span><span class="font4">XTRACT from report of a Jehovah’s witness who attended the ease:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The charge was made by the crown on the evidence of Constable Bishop, who said that he was offended at the loud noise made by the machine, as well as the nature of the matter broadcast. He stated that he was not a Roman Catholic but felt sure that many who were would likewise be offended. He claimed that what was broadcast was contrary to what he has believed since childhood. The “harsh American accent” was also offensive to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mr. McDonald closely questioned the informant and in a very short time eliminated the point of “noise” on the grounds that it was no greater than that made by several other cars which are equipped with loudspeakers and which work in Geelong in exactly the same way as that used by the defendants. He asked Constable Bishop if he ever visited Eastern Beach, where a loud-speaker plays jazz music most of the day on Sunday in the hearing of hundreds of people. The witness admitted that he had never had cause to charge the operator of this machine with offensive behavior. Witness also admitted that he had never taken action against any of the other people who are heard frequently using loud-speakers. lie admitted knowing of a church party which regularly holds outdoor services in principal streets of Geelong and that he has never charged this party with offensive behavior despite the fact that the beliefs expressed are contrary to what he has believed since childhood and that they make as much noise. He also admitted never having charged the Salvation Army workers with offensive behavior, even though the degree of noise created by them is greater than that created by the defendants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Having completely satisfied the bench on that point, the cross-examination proceeded and the point of “harsh American accent” was analyzed. Asked just what he considered harsh, the witness was unable to intelligently express a definition, so, with the prompting of the bench, admitted that it was without any mellowness or musical appeal. The bench was asked by the lawyer if it was prepared to insult America by suggesting that a voice with an American accent could possibly be regarded as offensive, and the point was soon dismissed amid laughter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The “nature of the matter broadcast” was next in turn for analysis, and it did not take the lawyer long to satisfy the bench that within the definition of the law no one could possibly be offended because others held and expressed different religious views. If the bench was prepared to admit that expression of religious beliefs, should they clash with the opinions of others, could be regarded as offensive, then it would be an easy matter to drag any preacher into court by simply standing outside a church and listening to the sermon, seeing that the beliefs expressed could be heard in a public place. He also pointed out very strongly the points concerning the constitutional law of Britain and spoke of the freedom allowed by the law for expression of religious beliefs. He asked the bench to consider for a moment what happens in such places as Hyde Park, The Domain, Yarra Bank and other places where a demonstration of what freedom of speech means to the people of Australia, at the same time pointing out that the bench would be assuming a great responsibility if it were to determine that these people (meaning defendants) should be denied the opportunity of exercising their religious liberty and publicly stating their beliefs. He went on further to point out that the work done by these people was a good work and reminded the bench of the parable of the wedding, when the servants were sent out into the highways and byways to gather in others, and used this as an illustration to describe the nature of the work. Constable Bishop stated that in his opinion the matter broadcast was definitely offensive to him and others; to which the lawyer replied that he wasn’t interested in his opinion, but wanted to establish what constituted an offense according to English law. The bench did not seem to have any difficulty in determining that no evidence had been brought forward to show that an offense had been committed within the definition of the word according to law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After the cross-examination was finished the lawyer addressed the bench and brought out the following points with emphasis:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The “noise” made by the defendants was no greater than other “noises” made in the same way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The machine was playing within the hearing of approximately 500 people and the crown had failed to produce one witness from this number (apart from a police constable) to support the contention that the broadcast was offensive. On the other hand, the defense could produce many witnesses to prove that the broadcast was of a helpful nature and brought them much comfort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Melbourne on Henley day the city police assisted a worker doing this same work, by providing a special parking area where the worker was assisted by the police to erect and play the machine to thousands of people and not one of these thousands had been known to take offense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This work is done all over Australia among thousands of people daily and no complaints of offensive behavior have been known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That Section 25 of the Police Act (under which the brethren were charged) applies to assemblies of people according to the Supreme Court definition recorded in 1918, and as no more than two or three people were in the street at the time, and these were walking up and down, the term “assembly” could not apply, hence the defendants should never have been charged under that section of the act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the time of speaking to the workers the constable did not make any complaint; at the most he asked</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">them did they not consider it offensive to be broadcasting in that way. If the constable had really been offended, in his capacity of policeman he had every right to tell the workers to move on; instead of that he stayed with them talking for some time endeavoring to induce them to sell him a book; in substance, challenging them to make a test case. Further, that the constable told the workers that he did not know if anything would come of it, as he would put a note on the superior officer’s desk. The lawyer held that if he (witness) was offended there would be no need to have a superior officer determine whether the matter could be brought into court, and that the evidence offered did not give a true representation of the mind of the witness on the day concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After a discussion the bench announced that the case would be dismissed, as no evidence had been brought to prove that an offense had been committed according to law, at the same time stating that the opinion was held that the constable did quite right in bringing the matter before the court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those are the main points of the case; I have mentioned them at length so as to have a permanent record. After the case the constable spoke to a little group of us in the street and asked us not to do the work in his street again, as only four people in the street are not strong Roman Catholics. We told him that Christ Jesus had said that this gospel must be preached to all people and that we could not deny anyone the opportunity of hearing the message. He assured the two brethren that he had no personal feeling against them, but simply wanted the matter decided in court.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark180"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark181"></a>A Catholic Gentleman of Fiji </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">By Harold Bice</span></h4>
<p><span class="font11">W</span><span class="font4">E MET on the Navua river; he was traveling in a dugout canoe with a few men, while I was sitting on a rock, waiting for help to get across the river. His dugout was well loaded, so he crossed over and sent the canoe back for me and my gear. On crossing over' he and 1, with the district policeman, traveled on foot, while my luggage was left with his to continue up stream. Overnight I had camped under an overhanging rock, But, as I had my mosquito net with me, 1 was O.K. The first question my friend asked me was, had I breakfasted? I said yes; I had breakfasted the previous day at eight o'clock, but I was not worrying about a few blank mealtimes—it was midday by now—I was quite able to wait till I got to Namuamua. We have four miles to go, cutting across the angles made by the river, the usual Fijian bush track traveling single file, my friend in the lead, then myself, with the officer in the rear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of course, I gave them the truth, and whenever I was silent for more than three minutes I was asked to continue. My friend, who was the king of Namosi, naively admitted that he and his people could not be sure what religion was the right one, as the Europeans who had brought these religions to Fiji were divided themselves, and he was highly delighted at the suggestion that all the Devil’s religions were wrong, and that while the law of Jesus Christ was to give to the poor, all these religions to the contrary made the poor poorer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After dining at Namuamua at about half past three I shed some of my books, to be picked up on my return, and started off to Namosi. The Tui-Namosi (i.e., king) walked ahead, I next, while two boys followed with his gear. I carried my own, which is my habit. We passed through Ona Koro and kept going, as we were late.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Drizzling rain did not dampen our spirits overmuch, because there was such a lot to discuss in relation to God’s purposes as recorded in the Bible. When it became dark one of the boys walked just ahead of me, giving me a hand whenever he thought that the way was awkward. He confided to me that the Turaga had told him to watch over me very carefully, not to let me slip on the stones, etc., in the dark. The boys wanted to carry my gear as well as their own, but I said no.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We arrived at Namosi two hours after dark. The Tui and his wife treated me like a son (they were elderly) and I, in fact, addressed her as Tinagu (i.e., my mother), which delighted both of them, none of their own children being home. After tea I gave them a lecture on the truth. We turned in. The Tui invited me to sleep with him on his bed, which was some bed, 8 by 10 feet, being a bamboo platform covered with native grass mats. The rest of the household slept on the floor. The Fijians and I myself prefer the floor, there being always plenty of mats, but the place of honor, the bed, is reserved for the stranger guest. Remark the contrast: one night under a rock; next night I shared the bed of a king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Over the bed was a dress sword given to the Tui’s father by Queen Victoria, which he wished to unwrap and show me, but I told him that I was waiting for the time when Isaiah 2: 4 would be fulfilled and swords beaten into ploughshares. As it was I hated all instruments of war, and those who teach people to use them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">My host admitted the fact that he had left the Wesleyan church and had ordered all his people to turn Catholic just because he was annoyed with the Wesleyan minister some years previously. Throughout his district I had very good audiences. The people delighted in the truth, as do the simple, meek, teachable people everywhere. The real Fijian is nature’s gentleman, where he has not been too much contaminated by so-called “Christian civilization and religion”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The more I travel, the more do I realize the fact that Jehovah God made all nations of one blood to dwell on the face of the earth—and the natural feeling in all races is to be courteous and kind to the stranger, but this natural feeling is atrophied, especially amongst the ruling elements, and international jealousies divide the peoples, while the white race has been taught to look down on the dark races and keep them in servile positions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many people say here, “Don’t educate the Indians and Fijians too much, as they get cheeky and act as if they were as good as we.” They cry out because these people send money home to India from here. Well, I ask, did not God put the gold and silver in the earth for the benefit of all ? So, let it go, and thank Him for the privilege of using the things He has provided. Jehovah created the earth for the benefit of all. The ruling elements have stolen the heritage of the people, but soon God will restore His gifts to the people. Let us continue to pass on the water of life to the teachable, while warning the proud and arrogant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Honor and glory be to Jehovah God and His King Christ Jesus, the champion of the poor and downtrodden. Let us advertise His government of righteousness while we have breath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Listen to the Mockingbird”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">W</span><span class="font4">HEN I was out witnessing one day last summer I called at a dilapidated old farmhouse and asked the woman who came to the door if she would like to hear a lecture by Judge Rutherford. She said she would. But the room was devoid of furniture; so I placed the portable on the floor near the center of the room, and opened up the phonograph, and soon had the judge’s speech going. Almost immediately a mockingbird came hopping in through the open door, and stood with his head cocked on one side, as if listening attentively. After a half minute or so I turned my head and the bird flew to the window sill, but remained there as if listening attentively. I asked if the bird was a pet, but was told it had never been in the house before. —George B. Watson, pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">William Raises 50c and Nether Regions</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">W</span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">illiam Brown, writing in from Michigan, says, softly and apologetically: “For some time back I have been planning to sign for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font4"> I intended to do so just as soon as I got rich, but although I have faithfully chased the golden calf, he, she or it has eluded me. Never, at any time during the chase, have I got close enough to grab it by the tail. So, after robbing the baby’s bank, and securing loot to the amount of fifty cents, I enclose it herewith. I am compelled to buy according to my means. The only thing wrong about </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> is that it is thirty years too late.” William then makes some reflections on the Roman gunmen in and out of uniforms which some might possibly construe as a reflection on the Holy Roman harlot, and as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> doesn’t want to get busted in the nose ahead of time, it will just quote one paragraph: “The Church is in possession of the Army, the Navy’, the National Guard, the American Legion, the police force, Knights of several orders of assassins, vigilantes, silver shirts, black shirts, silk shirts and dirty shirts, including banksters, gangsters, lawyers and judges; however, it is all right with me because I expect to get a job helping to unload the 'Holy Pope’s’ baggage at the front door of the White House, and then be appointed official custodian of the booze room. No American child is safe in a community infested by Rome's officers of the law. Some of them claim that they would not beat their fellow men with log chains or slit a child’s throat for less than a dollar, but the evidence shows to the contrary.” All will be glad that Bill found the 50c, and, if they still have a sense of humor, will notice Isaiah 14:9 and wonder just how he got the automobile jack under the big axle in such slippery winter weather as prevailed at the time his communication was written.</span></p>

Like its mistress, it breathed cleanliness, order and poverty.</span></p>

The children were likely to be dismissed from school for insubordination and, if they did not return penitent, the mother might face a jail sentence for their non-attendance. I explained the situation to her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“If we must suffer for our obedience to the Word of God as we understand it, so be it. I would rather have my children die than have them lose their souls. I was born and raised a Catholic. My parents were Polish. Not until I joined the witnesses of Jehovah had I realized what the Word of God might mean in my everyday life. Now I have seen the light and I know that this wicked world will soon be called to judgment. If people would but read the Bible and follow God’s Word to the least instruction there would be no wickedness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">She reached for one of the two Bibles which lay on the table, flanked by several leaflets of the cult. She opened at chapter 20 of the book of Exodus and pointed to a well-marked passage : “Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God.” Haltingly she read the ancient words. Then she produced a Webster’s dictionary from a drawer : “To salute means <sup>f</sup>to honor, to bow to’. We love our country, but we love all mankind and, above all, God. The flag is an image, and my children are obeying God’s command in refusing to salute a man-made image. I do not force my convictions upon my children. I teach them only the Word of God. They are free to decide for themselves. Why can’t everyone leave us alone? We are not trying to force our truth on anyone. We just want to live according to the Word of God as we understand it. Is it Christian to persecute us for it ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There was something noble about this woman and her simple faith. The spirit of the primitive Christians and of the evangelical Protestants of Bohemia who were exiled and persecuted for their faith seemed to have been revived in her. She was superbly herself with the sturdy simplicity of her peasant ancestry. There was here no sensationalism or ulterior motive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“There are about a hundred of us at the meetings,” she went on. “We read the Bible together and try to understand the will of God. Then we visit other people in the community and try to explain to them the beauty and greatness of the Bible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Three beautiful, intelligent children wandered into the room one after the other. The eldest, aged thirteen, spoke with normal enthusiasm of “gym” and basketball.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I thought of the indignant school authorities, the expressed regrets that this mother was American-born and could not be deported. Lamely I argued that the children were too young to be induced to fight for causes, that if they learned a good deal and formed their own opinions they would be better fitted to make this world a more Christian one. It was unbearable to think of these innocents persecuted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“No, lady, I am not asking them to fight for anything, or to advocate anything. All I am teaching them is to follow the Word of God. As the twig is bent, so the tree inclines. If they don’t learn now to stand for what they believe, no matter what happens, how will they stand out against the wickedness of the world when they grow up? God will take care of us. If they want to take the bread and education from my children, we are ready to bear it. But whatever happens, we will not falter.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Somehow I felt deeply grateful that my arguments for opportunism had fallen on so deaf an ear. Grateful, and ashamed of myself and the society for which I was playing intermediary. Such literal interpretation of the Bible might be misguided. But whatever one’s point of view as to that, it renews one’s faith in the possibilities of men to see an ideal so tenaciously upheld, so overwhelmingly ruling a human life. Have we reached the place where there is no longer room for that in the American tradition? —Marie Miller, in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Christian Century.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">O</span><span class="font4">N THE Kenya farm of Mrs. Helen Selwyn, she suspected a native named Keyen of stealing some cowbells. In the effort to extort a confession she had him beaten with a piece of rubber tire until it was worn out, and then with a dirty strap. When he tried to rise she had the natives that did the beating hold him down. After he was beaten she had him bound to a post, with a chain around his neck and his hands tied together. When it became apparent that he needed medical attention her husband, then living, and a brother of the ‘Very Reverend” Edward Gordon Selwyn, dean of Winchester, refused to take the wounded man to the hospital, on the ground that he would not have any baboons carried in his car. Thereupon the injured man walked the seventeen miles, dying shortly afterward. Mr. Selwyn, in the meantime, also died suddenly. As the native was dying he repeatedly stated that he had no idea why he was beaten, being entirely innocent of any wrongdoing, so far as he knew. Mrs. Selwyn, who supervised the murder, was given a year in prison. The natives who were compelled to do the flogging under her direction were each given one month.</span></p>

The farmer tied the native’s hands, took him back to the farm, tied him with a riem, a strip of oxhide, around his neck and beat him till he nearly killed him. The native was a man of 60 years. While on the rampage Carstens beat other natives with the sjambok, including Maria, a woman native. When the woman was examined there was scarcely a part of her body not covered with weals. The acting surgeon said “he found her body was covered with bruises and weals too numerous to mention”. The beast got off with a fine of $75, which he paid.

<p><span class="font4">In stating matters thus bluntly, it is not to be assumed that the aim of this article is to underrate or deprecate the inestimable boon of the “salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him”. (Hebrew’s 2: 3) Truly, the knowledge of being a sharer in this “common salvation” brings joy and gladness. (Jude 3) Such joy and gladness, how’ever, do not necessarily call for noisy demonstrations such as were common in the heyday of the revivalist business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Revivalists made merchandise of the message of God’s grace, and measured their success by the number rather than the sincerity of their converts, and by the size of the collection more than anything else. The few sincere participants in these efforts at “revival” w’ere deceived, turned aside from a rational and truly Godfearing course by Satan’s ever-nev<sup>r</sup>, never-new<sup>7 </sup>device of emphasizing the wrong thing, and obscuring and covering up the most important thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus show’ed that this tendency to stress the wrong thing at the expense of the more important things was the specialty of the Pharisees. While neglecting the weightier things they were careful to “tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs”.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark242"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark243"></a>Jesus Ridicules the Pharisees</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">This bit of ridicule from the lips of the Master is an example of how He ruthlessly dealt with the absurdities to which fallen human nature is prone to give attention. “Ye tithe mint and rue!” Doubtless a laugh went up from His hearers as Jesus in these words pictured the Pharisees laboriously counting the small seeds and laying aside one in ten “for the Lord”. (Matthew 23:23) On the same occasion He provoked the mirth of His listeners by the sally, &quot;Ye strain at a gnat and swallow a camel.’—Matthew 23: 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The meticulous Pharisees and their hangers-on doubtless had their “religious susceptibilities” severely shocked by these “irreverent” charges against their “holiness”. (Matthew 15:12) But the common people heard Him with pleasure, and Jesus was not offended by their mirthful laughter when He drew the picture of these “holy” men swallowing camels with the greatest of ease, but choking w’hen attempting to swallow a small fly. Nor was the force of the illustration lost upon them; for the Pharisees saw their influence steadily waning.—John 12:19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Modern Pharisees are not a whit different from their Jewish counterparts. From the long, pious and hypocritical prayers to the long ecclesiastical clothing, long faces and long continued wickedness they are still the same pernicious lot; the greatest obstacle to all true progress and the w’orst menace to the W’ell-being of sane and honest men.—Mark 12: 38-40; Matthew 23: 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is this unholy tribe that has fostered the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;me</span><span class="font4"> and God” type of religion, because it brought “results&quot;! They were out to “sell God” to the people, and they “sold Him”, to use an expression common with them. Gathering to the selfish side of the people has met with measurable success in a pecuniary way in the past, but the time has come when it will no longer work. The people no longer fall for their line. They “don’t respond as they used to do” or “hit the sawdust trail as they once did”. The worm has turned. Adding to the words of God, the clergy, including the evangelists, have reaped what they have sown.—Proverbs 30: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The thought generally associated with “being saved” was that the individual escaped the cer-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">tain prospect of “eternal hell-fire”.<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark244">1</a></sup> This expression is nowhere found in the Scriptures, and the thought associated with it is entirely and thoroughly wrong. True, the Scriptures use the word “hell”, or, at least, modern versions employ that word in the translation of several Hebrew and Greek terms. These, however, have meanings quite different from the popular “hell-fire” idea. Almost invariably they refer to the condition of death, or destruction.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark245"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark246"></a>The “Hell-Fire” Artists</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">“Hell-fire” has been the main dish of the Pharisaical outfit, both Protestant and Catholic. But the “revivers” misnamed “evangelists” were the real “hell-fire” artists. How the lukewarm church member and the cold backslider would “revive” when held for a sufficient length of time over “hell-fire”! True, some “hardened sinners” took longer to thaw out than others. Hence the “revival” was continued sometimes as long as a week or two. In some instances (where collections were good) work was continued even longer. Everyone in the community v ho could be persuaded, threatened, cajoled or browbeaten was well “revived”, according to the standards of pharisaical Christianity, while others were saved &quot;from lives of sin”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From the standpoint of the Word of God, however, the proselytes were generally “twofold more children of Gehenna” than the “revivalists” themselves, which, however one views the matter, is a truly remarkable if not desirable accomplishment.—Matthew 23:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With artistic skill the “reviver” would picture for the gaping, popeyed audience all the blackness and darkness of sin, all the terror and torment of hell, and all the glory and brightness of heaven. To &quot;hell” the sinner would certainly go if not saved; to heaven he was certainly entitled if saved in the approved manner. The “triune” argument, however unscriptural, was a difficult one to resist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So far only the “protestant” side of the salvation business has been considered. But do not think that the Romish soul-doctors were one whit behind their “protestant” brethren. In fact, the “protestant” version of the matter lacked much of the efficiency of the Roman system. The work of the former was carried on only by fits and starts, but the Romish priests had the business systematized with diabolical thoroughness. It was a steady job with them, carried on in summer and winter, in sickness and health, in town and in country, in want and in wealth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Rich and poor, great and small, the clever and the simple, all were brought in under the all-inclusive and thoroughly organized “salvation” business of the Papal organization. No such rough-and-ready methods as were used by the “revivers” would do. No mere deliverance of the living from a final and settled fate. That was clumsy work, and left only small hope of “repeat orders”.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark247"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark248"></a>The Romish Version</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">Consider the subtilty of the more proficient “salvation” vendors. Theirs was a sure-fire, alltime success. For they did not rashly send their rather reluctant prospects to a place 'which would forever preclude them from becoming paying customers. Not the Catholic “church”. This cult is too smart, too “broad-minded”, too inclusive and too “universal” for anything so shortsighted. Only for the most hopeless “heretic” is the never-ending fate of “hell-fire” reserved by the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The idea is this: A purgatory has been </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">lovingly</span><span class="font4"> provided, according to this system, and furnished ■with torments of all descriptions; terrible, exquisite, revolting torments, to ‘purify the soul’, after death. And, of course, “mother church” can help those who are confined there. In fact, anybody and everybody can help to help the ‘purgatorian’ residents, otherwise known to Catholics as “the holy souls”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">See here the difference between the “mother church” and the other cults. The latter say, when a sinner dies, “All hope is gone.” But “mother church” says, wisely (and how!), “All danger is gone.” Once in “purgatory”, there is only one way out, and that is to go to heaven. One cannot go to “hell” from “purgatory” (though it is as bad as hell while one is there). The third crown in the pope’s tiara vouches for that.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark249"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark250"></a>Getting Out of “Purgatory”</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">Only the priests can get one out of “purgatory” ; and that seems only right, since they invented the idea. They should have full charge, subject only to the superior authority of their father (John 8:44), who, however, lets them have pretty much their own way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How, then, is it said that “everybody can help'’? By doing as the priest says, of course. That should be clear, very clear, to everybody. Now, to help friends, relatives, and others out of “purgatory’’, and incidentally shorten his own stay there, the papist Catholic can do any one of a number of things. There is the “saying” of prayers. He gets a prayer book to “say” the prayers. It seems that prayers read out of a book are the only ones that really do very much good. That’s what the priests say. [A “prayer book” is 25c and up.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then, for further benefits, the “purgatory” enthusiast gets a rosary and gets it “blessed” by the priest. Any priest will be glad to “bless” a rosary—for a consideration. On the rosary the prayers are repeated, over and over and over, until they become thoroughly mechanical. (For some reason the prayer wheel has not yet been adopted by the Hierarchy. It would be a great convenience, especially as it could be run by electricity and the “prayers” wafted heavenward, or somewhere, at a great rate.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then, for special favors, one gets a statue of Mary or Anthony or any one of a thousand “saints”. (It does not particularly matter that these statues in most cases look no more like the ones they are supposed to represent than they look like the one who prays to them, or at them, or over them, or what have you. Then one can get scapulars, medals, crucifixes, shrines, votive lights, candles, etc., etc., all of which help the “salvation” business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But, believe it or not (and you doubtless won’t), nothing helps so much as the “saying” of “mass”. Benefits derived from all other “devotions” combined do not compare with the benefits derived from “mass”. That’s what the priest says, and he </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">should</span><span class="font4"> know, though he doesn't. Only----, only----. Well, only remem</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ber that no one but a priest can say mass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And if you do not attend mass, says the priest, all your other “devotions” amount to nothing. And does one </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">pay</span><span class="font4"> for mass? Oh </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">no, </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">no, NO, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NO! </span><span class="font4">Certainly not! One gives the priest a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">stipend </span><span class="font4">for special masses. A stipend is anywhere from $5 up. High money, high mass; low money, low mass; no money, no mass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That, very briefly, is the tenor of the “salvation” business in the Catholic Hierarchy’s scheme. Many details had to be omitted in the telling. Indeed, says the priest, no one can tell it properly except the priest. While there are supposed to be many 'helpers’, “saints,” of all descriptions, that “stand between” God and the subjects of the Hierarchy, the main one is the priest, the Hierarchy itself being composed of the priestly class.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark251"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark252"></a>Salvation Is of Jehovah</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">But “the salvation of the righteous is of Jehovah”. (Psalm 37:39, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font4"> Their hearts “rejoice in his salvation”. (Psalm 35:9) “It shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of Jehovah shall be [saved].”—Joel 2:32, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.;</span><span class="font4"> Acts 2:21; Romans 10:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Salvation is to be ascribed only unto God, who sits upon the throne of the universe, and unto the Lamb. (Revelation 7:10) Graciously Jehovah associates with His own great name that of His chosen instrument, the meek and lowly “Lamb of God”, the True and Faithful Witness, the Lord Jesus Christ. “There is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.”—Acts 4:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But why? It is because all men were brought under condemnation as an indirect result of the sin and judgment of Adam. Before any of the human family were born into the world Adam was under the sentence of death and dying, and as a result none of them received from him perfect life or the right to life. All are born in sin and shapen in iniquity.—Romans 5:12,17-19; Psalm 51: 5; Job 14: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All human creatures are condemned, disapproved, because imperfect. Being born in sin, all must ultimately die. God, however, made provision through His beloved Son Christ Jesus “that they may have life, and may have it abundantly”. (John 10:10, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font4"> Repentance, faith and obedience are necessary for the sinner to receive the gift of God, which is eternal life. (Romans G: 23) 'Repent, and believe the good tidings,’ was the exhortation of Jesus when He preached the message of the kingdom of God. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Repentance</span><span class="font4"> means to change one’s mind respecting sin, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">conversion</span><span class="font4"> implies the further step of changing one’s course of action. The repentant one must exercise faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as the Savior. Belief necessarily implies a course of action in harmony with that belief. One does not truly believe unless his actions, to the full extent of his ability, demonstrate sincere faith.—Mark 1:15; James 2:18-20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All men were born under condemnation, and the only way to be saved, that is, to get from under that condemnation, is to believe on Him whom God has sent to be the Savior of men. “He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.” (John 3:36) God’s wrath, displeasure, disapproval or condemnation rests upon all transgressors. He has, however, provided redemption for those who repent and, believing, change their course of action to conformity with Jehovah’s holy will.—Acts 17: 30.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark253"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark254"></a>Wise unto Salvation</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">One cannot have God’s blessing or approval while ignoring His appointed way for salvation from death through Christ. Relying upon the teachings of men will lead, not to everlasting life, but to death. (Proverbs 14:12; 16:25) Following one’s own inclination is likewise disastrous. (Proverbs 3:5,6) Acknowledging God in all one’s ways will lead one to diligently search the Scriptures, obey them, and give Jehovah God the honor due Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It will not do to shout “I’m saved”, and to say “I believe on the Lord Jesus Christ”, and at the same time fail to “study to shew thyself approved unto God” by learning to know “the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ 'Jesus”.—2 Timothy 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A reasonable and consistent course of action is required of those who, having repented, line up on God’s side. This course of action must be in harmony with God’s will as expressed in His Word. (Psalm 119:105) Also, one must confess with his mouth the Lord Jesus, “for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.”—Romans 10: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Whether one is of the class pictured by Jehu or of the group represented by Jonadab, it is his privilege to witness to the truth which Jehovah has graciously bestowed upon him. Both the 144,000 and the great multitude mentioned in Revelation proclaim and sing forth the praises of Jehovah and His King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Salvation is brought by Jehovah’s anointed King. The last reference to salvation in the Hebrew portion of the Scriptures is found in Zechariah 9:9, where the prophet foretells the coming of Zion’s King, “just, and having salvation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">When Joseph was informed that his espoused </span><span class="font4">wife, the virgin Mary, was to be the mother of the coming King, the angel said to him, “Thou shalt call his name JESUS; for he shall save his people from their sins.” (Matthew 1:21) The father of John the Baptist rejoiced in the promised Savior, and sang, “[God] hath raised up an horn of salvation for us.” John came to “give knowledge of salvation unto his people”.—Luke 1:69, 77.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The time is at hand when “all flesh shall see the salvation of God”. (Luke 3:6) In no other name is there salvation. (Acts 4:12) He is for salvation to the ends of the earth. (Isaiah 49: 6; Acts 13:47) He is the “author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.”-Hebrews 5:9.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark255"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark256"></a>Salvation and Vindication</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">The salvation and deliverance of the righteous by Jehovah’s chosen servant Christ Jesus will be to the vindication of God's holy name; and that is the thing of first importance. “Jehovah preserveth [saves] all them that love him; but all the wicked will he destroy.” (Psalm 145: 20) The salvation of the righteous and destruction of the wicked will demonstrate that Jehovah is God.—Psalm 83:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “wicked shall not be”. (Psalm 37:10; Proverbs 10:25) There will not be, as in the fantastic dreams of the Dark Ages, some chamber of horrors in a far corner of God’s grand universe, in which the wicked will be eternally preserved and tormented, blaspheming the holy name of Jehovah to all eternity. The wicked shall be “punished with everlasting destruction” and shall be no more remembered. —2 Thessalonians 1:9; Psalm 37:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The final and everlasting scene will be the righteous “heaven and earth” in which all things and all creatures will be in perfect harmony with Jehovah and with one another. (Isaiah 65:17-19) Every knee shall bow and every tongue confess (devotion) to Jehovah God in the name of His King Christ Jesus.—Isaiah 45: 23; Philippians 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“And there shall be no curse any more: and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be therein: and his servants shall serve him; and they shall see his face: and his name shall be on their foreheads. And there shall be night no more; and they need no light of lamp, neither light of sun; for the Lord. God shall give them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">—Revelation 22:3-5, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
