<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark11"></a>OUR RESPONSIBILITY</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“To whomsoever much has been given, from him much will be required; and io udiom'much has been entrusted, of him [the more] will be demanded.”—Luke 12:48, Weymouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH docs everything in order. He gives life to his creatures, “every man in his own order,’’ those who are made members of the royal house being placed by him in the highest order. Each one of the members of that capital organization is placed in a position in the body according to God’s own pleasure. (1 Cor. 15:23; 12:18) To be pleasing to God the creature must take an orderly course, and for this reason the man of good will, having sincerely desired to serve God, prays to him: “Order my steps in thy word; and let not any iniquity have dominion over me. Deliver me from the oppression of man; so will I keep thy precepts. Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes.’’ (Ps. 119: 133-135) “The steps of a good man arc ordered by the Lord; and he delighteth in his way.’’—Ps. 37:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Responsibility of the creature to the Creator is in proportion to the knowledge possessed by the cieature or that which, by the exercise of due care and diligence, the creature might acquire. The know ledge which the creature receives from God’s Word discloses to him the opportunity for seiwing God and to thereby prove his integrity toward God. As opportunities increase, the responsibility of the creature increases. Negligence or indifference finds no support in the Scriptures. “Neglect not the gift that is in thee.’’ (1 Tim. 4:14) “How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto ns by them that heard him.’’ (Heb. 2:3) This rule applies both with reference to acquiring knowledge of God’s purpose and to the performance of service as opportunity is afforded.—2 Cor. 8:7; ITcb. 6:11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Jesus spoke with full authority from God when he said: “To whomsoever much has been given, from him much will be required; and to whom much has been entrusted, of him [the more] will be demanded.” (Luke 12:48, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Weym.)</span><span class="font3"> Those words apply primarily to the ones that voluntarily have become the servants of God at the time of the coming of the Lord Jesus for* judgment, and this is shown plainly by the context: “ ‘Who then,’ replied the Lord, ‘is the faithful and [prudent] steward whom his Master will put in charge of His household to serve out their rations at the proper times? Blessed is that servant whom his Master when He comes shall find so doing. I tell you truly that He will put him in authority over all His possessions.’ ”—Luke 12:42-44, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Weym.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">* The rule must of necessity apply to all persons who have agreed to do the will of God, and hence includes those who compose the “great multitude”. Jehovah’s rules are fixed and never change. (Alai. 3: 6) The rule is specifically applied to those who by reason of unfaithfulness find themselves in the “evil servant” class, concerning whom Jesus says: “But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming ; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken.”—Luke 12:45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>9</sup> That which honest men have desired and for which they have looked forward during a period of many centuries is the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and his kingdom. One having agreed to do the will of God, and having been enlightened concerning his coming and his kingdom, is under such responsibility that if that creature, then, by becoming negligent and indifferent concerning the kingdom interests, by his course of action denies the coining of the Lord Jesus, he is placed in the “evil servant” class, b'or that reason Jesus puts it in this manner: “But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth.” The heart is the scat of motive, and man discloses his motive by the course of action he takes. lie doos not need to use his mouth in speaking words, because his actions speak with greater force than his words. The one who fears God will therefore be on the alert at all times lest he should fail in safeguarding the kingdom interests committed to him and thereby incur the displeasure of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">GIVEN</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Note that the words of Jesus show that there are two separate and distinct things to which we must give consideration: (1) What has been given to us; and (2) what has been entrusted to us as his servants. God gives to his servants a knowledge of Iris Word, thereby making known to them his purposes. The Lord entrusts to his servants the kingdom interests. The coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple, as the Scriptures and facts show, took place in 1918, and that marked a definite dividing point as to things given and as to things entrusted to God’s servants. Following the death of the apostles there quickly came a time of great ignorance and darkness concerning the purpose of Jehovah, and this continued for many centuries. From 1878 forward there was a gradual restoring of the truths that had been hidden during the long period of the past. Prior to 1918 the servants of the Lord applied the words of Jesus recorded at Luke 12:48 to the time of the millennial reign of Christ. Now it is clearly seen that those words of Jesus state a rule of judgment, and specifically and with greater force apply at the coming of the laird Jesus to the temple for judgment, which judgment he begins with those who have entered into a covenant to do the will of God.—1 Pet. 4:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">’ Prior to 1918 those consecrated to God understood and believed that God sent Jesus to earth and permitted him to be put Io death as a ransom for all men; that the doctrine of eternal torment is false and that the wages of sin is death; that God takes out from amongst men his church, the members of which must develop character that would justify them in reigning with Christ Jesus, the Head of the church, and rule the world during Ihe thousand years following the time of glorification; that the church constitutes the elect company or ‘‘little flock”, the members of which arc changed in the first resurrection to the likeness of the Lord Jesus Christ; and thought that they saw that God has a secondary company composed of those who are begotten by his spiiit, and that such, by reason of their neglect or lack of complete faithfulness, must be forced into great tribulation, and that out of that tribulation they would come fully purged and be given a secondary place in the spiritual realm of God, and that such company therefore is known as the “great multitude” or ‘tribulation company’ or ‘consolation saints’. It was understood and believed that the great masses of humankind will have life on earth by means of restitution; that 1914 would end the earthly journey of the spiritual class and that shortl.y thereafter restitution of mankind would begin. Those who really love God and the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ trusted in the Lord and waited upon him, being anxious to de his will. Others who had consecrated themselves to God, but who were moved by a selfish desire to be in the kingdom class to help rule the world, fell away and were relegated to the “evil servant” class. To all of those who had made a covenant with God something had been given and something was required of each one who had received a knowledge of the truth. The requirements and responsibility were in proportion to what had been received, and faithful obedience was required of all who had received the truth. The heart condition of each one determined into what class he would be placed, whether of the faithful servant or of the evil servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">MORE GIVEN</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Some of the foregoing truths given to God's people prior to 1918 were misunderstood and misapplied by them, but they surely understood enough to make them responsible to God and to require faithful service of each one in the covenant with Jehovah. The evidence shows that it was in 1918 that the Lord came to God’s temple for judgment, but that fact was first made known to the people of God about 1922. By flic Lord’s grace the light began to increase upon his people. Since that latter date there have been gixen to the consecrated many wonderful truths and the light flashing from the temple has greatly enlightened all of God’s people who have been of a pure heart and diligent in receiving that which was given. We haxe a clearer vision of our responsibility to the Lord whin we give consideration to these truths. It was since 1922 that the consecrated began to appreciate Ihe fad that Christ Jesus is at the temple conducting a judgment of the house of his Father, and this he has done that the approved ones “may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness”, (Mal. 3:1-3) Thereafter instruction in the Scriptures was received and with clearer vision, and the hearers became better equipped to serve the Lord, and their responsibility increased in proportion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">’Since the coming of the Lord to the temple the importance of obedience has been magnified in the mind of the anointed. They have seen and appreciated how Christ Jesus has always been obedient and the necessity for each one following in his steps to likewise be obedient. Jesus was King when he ascended into the heaven, but he was still subject to Jehoxah and must obey instructions, and this he always doe.s with delight. He joyfully obeyed Jehovah’s will to wait for 1900 years befoie beginning his reign. Why must he wait? Because Jehovah had decreed that Satan should have a fixed period of time in which to make an effort to prove his boastful challenge, (Ps. 110:1) Why is so much consideration given to Satan The consideration is not for Satan’s benefit, but that God’s creatures may hear and appreciate the facts in his due time to have them declared, and may second appreciate the supremacy of Jehovah God in tr.e exercise of his power. For this reason Jehovah said to the Devil: “For this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.” (Ex. 9:1G, Lccser) The great truth set forth in this scripture was not understood until after the coming of the Lord to the temple for judgment. Previously the consecrated had understood that this scripture applied to Pharaoh of Egypt; but now it is clearly seen that Pharaoh was merely a visible representative of the Dexil and that the scripture particularly has reference to the Devil and states the reason for permitting him to remain. By this scripture two tilings are greatly magnified, which things must be done before wickedness is cleared out: (1) There must be a world-wide testimony delivered by the chosen witnesses of Jehovah advising those who will hear that Jehovah is God, that he is supreme, and that Uhrist is King, and (2) there must be exhibited the supreme power of Jehovah, that no one can have any excuse to deny that lie is the Almighty. This explains why the testimony must be given and has been given following the World War, and why it must be finished before Armageddon, at which time God will fully exhibit his power. We had once believed that God had permitted evil in this world in order that men might learn how terrible evil is, but now we see that God has permitted evil or wickedness to afford Satan, the wicked one, the full and fair opportunity to make his challenge good and to afford men the op portunity to prove their integrity toward God. The privilege of being faithful to God is now magnified.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> Following the death of the apostles men became the teachers in the church, and this continued for many years; and not until after the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple was it seen and appreciated that Jehovah and Christ Jisus are the teachers and from this time onward those who love the Lord shall be taught of God, shall see their Teachers, and their Teachers shall not longer be ignored or pushed into a corner, (fsa. 30: 20) Now there is no excuse for the consecrated to commit the sin of Samaria by giving praise and worship to men. All praise, adoration and worship must be given to God and Christ Jesus. The kingdom of God or new nation was born in 1914, when God sent forth his beloved Son to reign. (Ps. 110:2) Sometime following that date the consecrated saw the great truth that there are two contending organizations, that of Satan and that of Jehovah; that the organization of Satan is symbolized by a wicked woman, and that the organization of .Jehovah God is pictured by a good woman; and it is the good woman that is God’s organization, which gives birth to the kingdom, and to her other children, and that 'all of her children are taught of Jehovah’, and great is their peace with God and in God, and great is their joy in serving him.—Isa. 54:13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS NAME</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> During the past few years the name of Jehovah has found a proper place in the mind and heart of each one of the anointed. Formerly it was sincerely believed that Jehovah's chief purpose in selecting the church was to prepare a few persons and qualify them to be joint rulers with Christ Jesus, take them to heaven, and then to assist Jesus in restoring the human race. Since the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple those of the temple class have been given to understand the true meaning of the name of Jehovah. They have been given to understand, and do understand, that God has visited the nations and taken out of them “a people for his name”. (Acts 15:14) They now see and appreciate the fact that God is the Creator of heaven and earth and the sole Giver of life, and that his name so signifies; that “Jehovah” means his purpose toward his creatures; that his name “Almighty” means that his power is without limitation, and that all power is vested in him, and that creatures exercise power only by his sufferance or permission and that God vests in Christ Jesus full power and authority in earth and in heaven; that the name “Most High” signifies that he is above all, and that all must be subject to and joyfully obedient to him. Jehovah God has therefore taken out from the nations of earth a people devoted to him that they may show forth his praises, and not the praises of men; that they may give testimony concerning his name and his kingdom, and not exalt creatures. These anointed ones now see and appreciate the fact that man worship or adoration is an abomination in the sight of God because it attributes to Satan and other creatures that which properly belongs to Jehovah. The taken-out anointed class are God’s sons or creatures set aside for his purpose and to perform certain duties while on the earth, and which duties they must perform.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup>- Since the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple there has been given to God’s people the great truth that Satan has been cast out of heaven and is now desperately trying to plunge all the human race into destruction because he knows that his time until Armageddon is short and that he must defeat God before that time, if at all. They also see and understand that there must be a world-wide testimony delivered, informing the people that the kingdom of God is here and that Christ is King, and that such witness work must be completed before Armageddon, and that, when it is completed, there will follow the greatest tribulation upon Satan’s organization, resulting in its complete destruction. They are gisen clearly to understand that this testimony must be delivered by the anointed witnesses of Jehovah and that because they arc Jehovah’s witnesses the Devil is using every possible means to destroy them. (Kev. 12:17) The persecution of God’s people continues to grow in intendty, and to offset such oppression and persecution God comforts his people by giving to them an understanding of his prophecies long ago hidden from the understanding of men. Therefore they now see and appreciate the words of the apostle in Bomans 15:4. Such comfort must be given to God’s people while they are on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> During the past few years God has given to his people an understanding of the prophecies of The Revelation, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Ilabakkuk, and many other prophecies. He has given to them tlie true meaning and understanding of Ins covenants. Gift upon gift has been bestowed upon his anointed ones, the giving of which truth has enlightened the mind and made glad the heart of each one devoted to Jehovah. &quot;Why has God, through Christ Jesus, bestowed upon </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font3">given these numerous gifts to his people in recent </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">years? The </span><span class="font3">Bible answers: Tor teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in right doing; so that the man of God may be complete, perfectly </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">equipped </span><span class="font3">for every good work. ’-2 Tim. 3:16,17, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Weym.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">” The conclusion necessarily follows that after the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple there is much work to be done on earth by those who are of the temple company and that the Lord gives to them an understanding of these truths that they may be fully equipped for such work. To such anointed ones, therefore, much has been given, and of them much will now be required. Being equipped, they must use that equipment, and if the equipment furnished by the Lord is not properly used it certainly will be tak</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">en </span><span class="font3">away and opportunities for service will be gone and the one from whom these gifts are taken will bo relegated to complete darkness. The facts show that many have been deprived of this divine equipment by reason </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">their failure to measure up to the requirements. Such requirements must be met and performed while the anointed are on the earth. Those who are unselfishly dexoted to God and who joyfully do with their might what their hands find to do are the ones that are equipped to do the work in hand and the ones to ■whom the Lord entrusts much more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ENTRUSTED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup> It is to Ihe anointed temple company that Jesus says: “To whom much has been entrusted, of him [the more] will be demanded.’’ (M'ci/m.) &quot;When the Lord Jesus appeared at the temple for judgment there appeared before him many who had been called but were not chosen and approved. The words of Jesus show that his judgment would remove all those wdio are prompted by selfishness and that only those who are unselfish, that is, who love God and his kingdom, would remain. ‘Many are called, but few chosen.’ (Matt. 20:16) ‘Not every one who says, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven; but only those who are obedient to my Father w’ho is in heaven.’ (Malt. 7:21, IVeym.) Full obedience is required, and such obedience must be willingly and joyfully rendered. At the coming of the Lord to the temple all the consecrated had received the same gift or amount of truth. Some had received it into a selfish mind and heart and counted self as more important than others, and looked forward with much satisfaction to the time when the reward should be received and the opportunity to be in heaven and to help rule the universe. The consummation of such hopes not having been realized in 1914, at the time expected, those selfish ones were offended. &quot;While they claim to be offended at some creature in God’s organization, their being offended was in fact against the Lord. Such selfish ones were assigned to the “evil servant” class. Those who truly love God and the appearing of his King and kingdom were foreshadowed in prophecy by Mordecai and Naomi, and those faithful ones standing before the Lord for judgment because of their love and faithfulness were assigned to the “faithful and wise servant” class. Later the ones coining to God through Christ Jesus, and who were foreshadowed in the prophecies by Esther and Ruth, were brought in and assigned to the same class. To those faithful and approved ones the Lord Jesus applied his prophetic words, as written: “Blessed is that servant, whom his lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing. Verily I say unto you, that he shall make him ruler over all his goods.” (Matt. 24: 46, 47) This faithful class, approved by the Lord, taken into the temple and anointed, received at his hands all his goods. Of the “faithful servant” class then, to whom his goods were entrusted, the Lord declares he will demand a full and complete and faithful accounting.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> What are the goods which the Lord entrusts to his faithful servant class? According to another translator this part of the text reads: “In solemn truth I tell you that he will give him the management of all his [property].” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Wcym</span><span class="font3"> ) The goods or property of the Lord consist of his kingdom interests, which kingdom interests he entrusts to his anointed ones. Such interests consist chiefly of making known the name of Jehovah God, the King and his kingdom. When Jesus was on earth he declared that he was sent to earth lor the purpose of giving testimony to the truth, and that all of his followers must do likewise. The time now having come for Jehovah to exercise his power through Christ Jesus, he sends forth Christ Jesus to rule while the enemy is still in operation, and Christ Jesus gi\es commandment to his anointed ones in these words: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” (Matt. 24:14) The great interests of the kingdom, therefore, must be made known. This obligation entrusted to the anointed is not inciely discretionary on their part, but is mandatory. The Lord having entrusted to them the privilege of doing this work, he demands that it shall be done efficiently and faithfully. The responsibility is so great that those who fail or refuse to obey shall suffer the adverse judgment of the Lord; as it is stated: ‘It shall come to pass that every soul that will not obey that great Prophet shall be destroyed.’ (Acts 3:23) The Lord demands of his anointed witnesses that they must do what he has commanded thorn to do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>17</sup> It was in 1914 that the Lord Jesus, under God’s commandment, began to exercise his power. (Rev. 11:18) Those to whom Christ Jesus entrusts his kingdom interests must not be murmurers or complaincrs nor moved by any selfish desire. (Jude 1,16-19) The ones taken out of the world to be witnesses to Jehovah’s name are God’s people, who must joyfully obey him. Therefore it is written of them: “Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.” (Ps. 110:3) The kingdom has begun; the morning thereof is here. These faithful ones arc from the womb, born early in the morning. They have the dew of youth, strong, vigorous, and they delight to energetically perform the duties that are laid upon them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> These are the chosen witnesses of Jehovah God, to whom he says: ‘‘Ye are iny witnesses, . . . that I am God.” (Isa. 43:9-12) To them the command is given: ‘Go throughout the city and mark the people who will hear,’ that is, carry to them the testimony of the truth, that they may have an opportunity to take their stand on the side of God and his kingdom and live, or to remain on the side of the Devil and be destroyed. (Fzek. 9:4,5) These kingdom interests tiie Lord cntiusts to Ihc anointed ones and demands of them prompt, efficient and faithful action.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">COVENANT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>19</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses arc his covenant people. The purpose of the new covenant, is not and never was to restore human creatures to perfection. The purpose is to take out a people for God's name and to use them to his honor and praise. No creature is forced into such covenant. God takes out no one from the world and brines him into the covenant until that person, trusting in the shed blood of Christ Jesus, voluntarily agrees Io do the will of God. The creature is therefore solemnly bound by his agreement to render full obedience unto the Lord. Those who willingly lireak that covenant by following a selfish course, and a course contrary to God’s will, are covenant-breakers and arc declared as worthy of death. (Rom. 1:31,32) Such covenant-breakers arc those who ‘‘fall into the hands of the living God” and suffer destruction, from which there is no resurrection. (Ileb. 10:29-31) The highest relationship that a creature on earth could possibly enjoy with Jehovah God and his kingdom is that of being in a covenant with the Lord as a witness to Jehovah’s name. To break that exalted and blessed relationship by neglect or willful commission of deeds against God and his organization can merit and receive but one thing, and that thing is complete destruction. Those who arc in the covenant with the Lord as a people for his name have given their allegiance to God and his kingdom, and they cannot divide that allegiance with any part of Satan’s organization. It is to this covenant people that the Lord has committed or entrusted his kingdom interests on earth, and now, when he is exercising his power, he requires of everyone in the covenant faithful performance. No manner of excuse can be offered for failure or refusal to perform according to the terms of the covenant. No creature can hold one in the covenant, and no creature can take him out save the creature himself. If he breaks his covenant, the responsibility rests upon him.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HIGHER POWERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> Paul, who served God as a true footstep follower and servant of Jesus Christ, according to the will of God wrote words of instruction to those who desired to know and to serve the Most High. He gave no adulation to human creatures that have tried to rule the earth. His sole duty was to serve God and Christ Jesus. He wrote under authority and inspiration from the lord. He addressed himself to those “called . . . saints” (Rom. 1:7), that is, those who have been cleansed by faith in the blood of Christ Jesus and fully devoted to God. To such, who had made a covenant Io do the will of God, the command is given: “Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers.” (Rom. 13:1) The Devil has caused religionists to lay hold upon this Scripture text and to induce men to believe that the “higher powers” are those men who hold the official positions in the government of this world, and the earthly rulers have been glad to have that construction placed upon the text because those who thus believe are more fully subject to their power. The true followers of Christ Jesus well know that their duty and obligation is to serve God and that when there is any conflict between the rules made by men and the law of God the servant of God must be obedient to God’s law rather than to man’s law. (Acts 4: 19, 5: 29) Such was the rule by which the faithful apostles of Jesus Christ were guided, and the rule is not and cannot be changed, because God’s rules do not change. (Alai. 3:6) Jt is the privilege of the followers of Jesus Christ, who are now on earth, to be siparate and distinct from the world. Their allegiance is to God and his kingdom, and their devotion must be to God and his kingdom. Jehovah through Christ Jesus has taken them out of the world and made them his witnesses, and to them the kingdom interests on earth have been entrusted, and God will permit no divided devotion between his kingdom and that of the enemy. He will permit no compromise with worldly organizations which at all times blaspheme God’s holy name. The faithful anointed, therefore, must do as commanded, that is to say, be fully subject to God and Christ Jesus, who constitute “the higher powers”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DEMAND</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> Those to whom the Lord has entrusted his kingdom interests must render a faithful and true accounting unto the Lord. To such anointed ones has been entrusted the greatest privilege ever given to any creatures, and hence the Lord says: ‘Much more will be demanded of them’ than from the servants of men. Faithfulness and unfaltering service to the Lord bring great persecution upon the servants of God. It could not be otherwise, because there is a bitter conflict between the Lord and the Devil. One must succeed. The Lord Jesus Christ, by Jehovah’s grace, will be victorious. God permits his beloved to be a&lt;-aulted by the L'evil. Jesus Christ, his perfect Son, was ciuelly persecuted by the Devil, and at all times Christ Jesus was wholly faithful and obedient to his Father, and by reason of obedience he suffered. Through all of this he maintained his integrity toward Jehovah God and was by Jehovah made the author of eternal salvation to all who obey him. (Heb. 5:9) There is no other way for the true followers of Christ Jesus to maintain their integrity toward God. The servant of Jehovah in this hour of great trial is subjected to great persecution by the Devil and his agents, and God suffers or permits them to be thus assaulted that they may have opportunity to prove their integrity. This great truth was never made plain to God’s people until it pleased the Lord to recently give them an understanding of the prophecy of Ilabakkuk. In every part of the earth called “Christendom” the Devil’s chief earthly agency, to wit, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, continues to increase the pressure upon and persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses. God could prevent this, of course, but he has a reason for permitting it, and those who render a full and true account to the Lord will ultimately come through unscathed and will have a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TRUTH</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> Jesus was sent to the earth by Jehovah to bear witness to the truth, and he said: “Every one who is of the truth hearkeneth unto my voice.” (John 18: 37, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">h’oth.)</span><span class="font3"> This means that anyone in Ihc covenant to do the will of God, and who fails or refuses to obey the Lord and hence does not bear witness to the truth as commanded, is no longer of the truth and cannot receive the Lord’s approval. The testimony must be delivered as the Lord has commanded, and all who receive the Lord’s approval in this day will joyfully participate in the giving of that testimony as opportunity is afforded. Tiie servant has no alternative, but must obey the Lord. There are not two courses, but just one, that he must take, and his only course is to obey the commandment of the Lord and do it joyfully. The true follower of Christ Jesus will not stop to debate the question as to what course he should take. His course is plainly marked out for him in the Scriptures, and he must close his eyes to everything else and therefore be blind to everything except the kingdom interests. “Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the Lord’s servant?” (Isa. 42:19) The kingdom is here, and the servant class, to whom the kingdom interests are entrusted, will go forth and proclaim the message of the kingdom and thus give a true accounting. In some parts of the earth, such as Germany, God’s faithful witnesses are thrown into prison, cruelly persecuted, beaten, and some of them put to death. This could not take place except by God’s permission; and since he does permit it, those who continue faithful unto death are certain to have the approval of the Lord. His approval js the only thing that is worth while.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> Why the emphatic demand that the truth now be told with greater plainness than ever before? Is it for the benefit of the Lord? Certainly not for the Lord’s benefit, because after the servant has done all he is still an unprofitable servant to the Lord. No one can bring any benefits to God. This is the ‘day of his power’, and before God will have his power employed for the destruction of the wicked one it is his purpose to have the warning given, that each one may bear his own responsibility. Israel symbolically stands for those who desire to serve and undertake the service of God, and it is the will of God that all such shall receive some knowledge. A watchman is one who watches out for and safeguards the interests that are committed into his keeping. God begins to exercise his power relative to the earth through Christ Jesus, and he provides a watchman for his kingdom interests on earth. That watchman is not one man, but is collectively made up of the “faithful and wise servant” class to whom God’s kingdom interests on earth are now entrusted. The Lord’s judgment day is here, and the hour rapidly approaches when he will destroy all the wicked who persist in their wickedness. To the “faithful servant” class the Lord therefore says: “I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning.” Then says the Lord to the watchman: ‘If you give them not warning and they die, their blood </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font3">will require at your hands.’ (Ezek. 3: 17-20) Here the Lord’s Word clearly shows that he has laid upon the servant class tiie duty of giving warning and information to others, that he makes his witnesses responsible for performance and demands full and complete obedience and performance by his servant, and he places responsibility upon all others who hear. It is the final testimony before the showdown between the Lord and the Devil.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> The Lord Jesus is now upon his judgment seat, exercising the power which God has committed into his hands, as both judge and the executor' of his judgments. Before him are all the nations of the earth. He now affords them an opportunity to choose whom they will serve, and therefore he causes his witnesses to bear' testimony in their hearing that they may choose to take their place on the Lord’s side and live, or remain on the Devil’s side and die. The giving of this testimony is therefore for the benefit of the people and affords, to those who so desire, an opportunity to take their stand on God’s side and have a part in the vindication of his name. Jehovah’s witnesses can be faithful only by giving the testimony in obedience to God’s commandment and thus look well to the kingdom interests entrusted to their care.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">GOOD WILL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>25</sup> At the birth of the man-child Jesus God sent his angel who declared to the witnesses there present that Jesus is the Savior of the people, and quickly there followed the prophetic song of the heavenly host praising God, and saying: “Glorj<sup>r</sup>, in the highest, unto God! and on earth peace, among men of good-will.” (Luke 2:14, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Hath.)</span><span class="font3"> That message did not mean the beginning of God’s good will toward men, because the will of God is always good. It means that the men on earth the will of whom toward God is good shall have peace with God. Through the blood of Christ Jesus shed for the redemption of man these may come to God and be at peace with him. The blood of Jesus was shed, not for the universal and arbitrary salvation and deliverance of all men, but for the benefit of those who are of good will and who manifest that good will by serving God and Christ Jesus. All who do not voluntarily take this step must of necessity perish. This is conclusively proved by the words written: ‘‘lie that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not sec life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.”—John 3:36.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> When man hears the truth, the responsibility is upon him to believe and obey the truth. If he refuses to heal' and believe the truth, the wrath of God continues upon him and is not removed. The condemnation is removed from those who do hear and believe and who take their stand on Ihe side of God and his kingdom. Having taken their stand on the Lord’s side, then the responsibility is upon such to faithfully serve God and Christ Jesus. The responsibility begins with the beginning of knowledge of Jehovah and his purpose; as it is written: ‘‘As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me; the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.”—Ps. 18:44.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>27</sup> Jehu was a picture foreshadowing Christ Jesus and the ‘‘faithful and wise servant” class, who constitute membership in the royal house. Almost all of the nation of Israel had repudiated the covenant with God and had gone over to the Devil and Devil worship. Jehu was sent forth to execute those Devil worshipers. In that land there was a man, one Jonadab, who was not an Israelite but who was of good will, desiring to do right and to serve God. Jonadab pictured a class of persons on the earth, aside and separate from the faithful and anointed servant class, who desired to serve the Lord. When Jehu met up with Jonadab he said to Jonadab, ‘‘Is thine heart right?” and Jonadab answered, ‘‘It is.” Jehu then said to Jonadab, in substance: ‘Prove it by giving me your hand and joining me in my chariot, and come with me and see my zeal for the Lord.’ (2 Ki. 10:15,16) There God caused a prophetic picture to be made foreshadowing a class of people who, since the coining of the Lord Jesus, the Greater Jehu, to the temple, have met up with the ‘‘faithful and wise servant” class, and which persons of good will desire to serve God, and these are now called upon to prove their good will toward God, and their desire for righteousness, by traveling along with and associating themselves with the organization of the Lord, which organization was foreshadowed by Jehu’s chariot.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> The Lord Jesus speaks of the faithful servant class as ‘‘his sheep”. Jonadab seems to more particularly picture the beginning of a class which Jesus referred to as his ‘‘other sheep”, saying: ‘‘I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine. As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.” (John 10:14-16) The ‘‘other sheep” here mentioned clearly are those persons of good will who are made manifest after the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple and the assembling of the temple company. In God’s due time this latter-named class are made a part of God's organization; and since Jesus is the good shepherd and chief servant of Jehovah God, all of these sheep become a part of one fold under the Lord Jesus as Ruler.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>29</sup> The same company of persons of good will arc also shown to constitute the ‘‘great multitude” described in Revelation 7:9. Those foreshadowed by Jonadab, the ‘‘great multitude”, and the ‘‘other sheep”, are all different titles applied to one and the same class, all of whom if continuing faithful will be for ever on the earth. The entire organization of Jehovah God i.s now bitterly opposed and persecuted by the wicked ones under the Devil’s direction, and all those who flee to God and Christ and become a part of the Lord's organization arc hated by the Devil. Among the people of the world who serve selfish interests and follow the wicked one neither the anointed company nor the ‘‘great multitude” arc desired. To all those who have signified their purpose to serve Jehovah, and who have put their trust in the Lord Jesus, God now speaks and says: ‘‘Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, 0 nation not desired.” (Zeph. 2:1) A separating work is now in progress, and the Lord Jesus at the temple is conducting this separating. Witnessing to the people is a part of this separating work, and these witnesses must give the warning concerning the day of the final expression of God’s wrath upon the wicked one and his organization. Jehovah through his prophet therefore further says: ‘‘Before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you, before the day of the Lord’s anger come upon you. Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness; it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord's anger.” —Zeph. 2: 2, 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>80</sup> This conclusively proves that between the time of the beginning of judgment at the temple and the time of giving the full expression to God’s wrath, a wide witness work must be done, and the privilege and opportunity of doing this work is entrusted to the “faithful and wise servant” class, and all who continue wise and faithful will have a part in this witness work. Such is a part </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">the kingdom interests, and the obligation is laid upon the witnesses to carefully safeguard such kingdom interests. The witness work must be completed before the battle of the great day of God Almighty. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font3">Lord demands of the “faithful and wise servant” class that each one shall acquit himself as a good soldier of Christ Jesus, prove his unfaltering love and devotion to Jehovah, and maintain his integrity by </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">boldly </span><span class="font3">proclaiming the truth in this day of God’s power. (1 John 4:17,18) lie makes this so positive and unequivocal that there can be no doubt about it, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font3">has caused to be written that those who fail or refuse to obey the commandment shall not live, but shall be destroyed.—Acts 3: 23.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>31</sup> Under the leadership </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">Christ Jesus the faithful members of his body, designated as “the bride”, engage in proclaiming the message of the kingdom. To all peisons of good will “the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth [that is, the ‘other sheep’, the Jonadab or ‘great multitude’ class] say, Come”; and let all others who thirst for truth and righteousness, and who being of good will take their stand on the side of the Lord and become Jonadabs, let all such say, Come; and all together give the witness for the kingdom and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">say </span><span class="font3">to the people that whosoever will may take his stand on the side of the Lord and receive the gift of life everlasting.—Rev. 22:17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RESPONSIBILITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">•’Each one in the Lord’s organization is therefore responsible unto God in proportion to the knowledge he possesses of and concerning the kingdom, or which knowledge by the exercise of due diligence he might acquire. For that reason the Lord says to all who have taken their stand on the side of God and Christ, “Seek righteousness, seek meekness; it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger.” There is only one way to seek righteousne.*- and that is to diligently seek to know and to do God’s appointed way. Ue is the righteous and holy one: “The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul; the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple: the statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.”—Ps. 19: 7, 8.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>33</sup> Guided by the perfect </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">law </span><span class="font3">of God the consecrated cannot go wrong. To be thus properly guided the man must have a pure heart; that is, his heart must be right, free from selfishness, and his motive or moving cause must be to serve God and his King because such is the right course to take. Therefore the Lord says to such: “Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it arc the issues of life. ” (Prov. 4:23) Not only must the moti\e la right when one begins to serve the Lord, but he must continue to keep his motive pure and his love set upon God. If one’s motive to serve the Lord is selfish he is certain to fail and fail entirely away. When Jehu said to Jonadab, “Is thine heart right, as my heart is?” clearly he meant that only those who have and maintain a pure condition of heart can remain in God’s organization.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>34</sup> To “seek meekness” means that one must be teachable, that is to say, willing and anxious to learn what is in God’s Word. Some who believe themselves to be of the “faithful servant” class do not deem it essential to continue to study God’s Word, and the explanation of his truths which he gives through the Watch Tower publications. One who takes that course is certain to fail unless he quickly recovers him&lt;elf from that wrongful way. Only those who are ailment in the study and application of the Word of Cod are safe from the Devil’s assaults, whether that p&lt; son be of the anointed or of the “great multitude” (o.npany. The proper attitude of the great multitude toward God and Christ Jesus is shown in these words: “Th-Tcforc arc they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple; and he that sitteth on toe throne shall dwell among them.” (Rev. 7: l'&gt;) Doing before the throne of God shows that they have his favor, and serving him day and night shows that they serve him all the time and the Devil none of the time.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">■” Much has been given to both those of the ‘‘little flock”, the anointed, and the “great multitude” or “other sheep”. Much more has been entrusted to the little flock, the anointed, and much more will l&gt; ■ and is now demanded of them by the Lord. Both the little floek, the anointed company, and the great multitude must now be diligent in the study of God’s Word and in bearing testimony of the truth to others as they have opportunity. Jehovah’s witnesses, the little liock, and the Jonadab or “great multitude” company must walk together and work harmoniously together. It is the duty of the anointed to render aid and comfort and encouragement to the Jonadab class. All of these then must be faithful and true to tiie Lord. Arr. vd against them is the Devil and all of his representati\cs. Therefore the greater necessity for all those who aie on the Lord’s side and in his organization to stand firmly together, dwelling in peace, and working harmoniously, and making known to others that Jehovah is God, Christ is King, and the kingdom is here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>30</sup> Let no one for a moment conclude that he can discharge his responsibility to God by merely taking his stand on the side of Jehovah and his kingdom. That first step he must and does take of his own volition. Having entered into a covenant to do the will of God, that covenant must be kept and performed by all, that is, all those of the royal house and those of the great multitude. All those who obtain God’s approval and receive the gift of everlasting life must be loyal and faithful. Is there a distinction between loyalty and faithfulness?</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark13"></a>SPIRIT POURED OUT ON ALL FLESH</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">O</span><span class="font3">NE of the figures of which considerable is said nt the prophecies of the Lord Jehovah God is the great ‘‘servant” of Jehovah. As a spokesman for Jehovah the prophet Isaiah pointed forward to him and said: ‘‘Behold my servant, whom I uphold, mine elect, in whom my soul delightcth; I have put my spirit upon him; he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles.”—Isa. 42:1, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah provides cumulative evidence, which means the testimony of one prophet to corroborate another prophet, and this he does for the strengthening of the faith of his people. As a further proof of the office and work of his ‘‘servant” class, he caused his prophet Joel (2:2S, 29) to write: ‘‘And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall drcam drcams, your young men shall see visions: and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The spirit of Jehovah is his invisible power. ‘Pouring out’ means a libation or a gushing forth. God puts his spirit upon his creatures to accomplish his purpose. He gives his spirit to no one unless that one desires to do God’s will and is devoted to Jehovah. This prophecy shows a gushing forth or pouring out of God’s spirit upon a class for a specific purpose. It had a miniature fulfillment at the feast of Pentecost in Jerusalem fifty days after the resurrection of Jesus from the dead, and it is completely fulfilled after &lt;he Lord comes to his temple in the year 1918. The proof is set forth on this occasion for the identification of God’s witnesses, and that their privileges and duties may be seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The prophecy shows that its fulfillment applies at the close of the experiences of the Israelites, and again near the close of the experiences of the true church which constitutes spiritual Israel. The prophet states that it applies just prior to ‘‘the great and the terrible day of the Lord [Jehovah] ”. (Joel 2:31) There came a great and terrible day upon the fleshly Israelites, the Jews, from A.I). G9 to 73. Jesus foretold another great and terrible day of the Lord God, to come at the time of his second presence and the setting up of the kingdom, and that just before that day there must be given a great testimony. lie said: ‘‘And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.”—Matt. 24:14, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At Pentecost the apostle Peter and others of the disciples received the anointing of the holy spirit. That was the first outpouring of the holy spirit. The account of this, as recorded in the book of the Acts of the Apostles, chapter two, verses one to five, reads: “And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">one </span><span class="font3">place [in Jerusalem J. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">rushing mighty wind, and it fdled all the house where they were sitting. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">And </span><span class="font3">there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them: and they were all filled with the holy [spirit], and began to speak with other tongues, as the spirit gave them utterance. And there were dwelling at Jerusalem, Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.” Not only were the apostles there anointed by the holy spirit, but they were given a special power to testify in various tongues, that all the foreign Jews present in the crowd that quickly gathered might understand. The opponents who stood by mocked and said concerning these men who spoke in various languages: “These men are full of new wine.” That the honest ones might understand the truth, Peter replied: “These [men] are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day. But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel.”—Acts 2:15,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Prior to that day of Pentecost G'od had put his spirit upon a very limited number. Jesus Christ was the first one who was brought forth by the spirit of God as the Son of God, and was in due time anointed with the spirit. Joel’s prophecy was, “Afterward [or, Hereafter] I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh.” The words “all flesh” must be understood as Peter interpreted the same, namely, all the families of the house of fleshly Israel, because the message was then limited to the Jews. On that occasion a great number believed on the Lord and in due order received the anointing of the holy spirit, even as the prophet had foretold. (Acts 2:38-41) On that occasion not only did Peter repeat the prophecy of Joel as having a fulfillment then, but his words arc also prophetic. He said: “And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams: and on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my spirit; and they shall prophesy: and I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath ; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke: the sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come. ’ ’ —Acts 2:17-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The words of the apostle, to wit, ‘ ‘ in the last days, ’ ’ locate the time for the complete fulfillment of his prophecy. “The last days” undoubtedly refers to the last days of the old world, or Satan’s organization, and the beginning of the reign of Christ. The apostle Paul said (2 Tim. 3:1-5): “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that arc good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.” We are now in “the last days”, and should therefore expect a fulfillment in completion of Joel’s prophecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After the apostles passed from earth, darkness came into the earthly organization of the church because of the influence Satan exercised over the leaders therein. At the beginning the Lord had planted his church on earth amongst men a pure “vine”, symbolically speaking, and then it degenerated into the “strange vine” of the earth, even as the prophet Jeremiah (2:21) had foretold it would.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the distressing time of the year* 1918 the true followers of Christ thought that the work of the church on the earth was done. During the year which followed some true followers of Christ awakened Io the fact that there was yet much to be done. In the period of time from 1918 to 1923 there was a great awakening amongst those who loeed the Lord. The zeal manifested by these shows that the Lord had put his spirit upon them. The greatest witness to the name of the Lord ever given on earth has been in progri--s since the year 1922, and still progresses. Such maiks the second or complete fulfillment of the prophecy of Joel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the prophecy it is written: “And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out, in those da\ s, of my spirit; and they shall prophesy.” (Acts 2:18) Prior to 1922 the preaching of the gospel had hem done chiefly by a few of the consecrated ones. After that time practically all of the anointed ones haee actively engaged in giving the testimony to God's purpose to set up his kingdom, his vengeance, and the blessing of all the famdies of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Prophesying, or preaching, may be done cither by word of mouth or by placing in the hands of the people the message of truth in printed form. Such has been done, and is now being done, by young men and young women as well as old men and old women. “All flesh,” therefore, means all those among the men and women who are consecrated and anointed with the spirit of God, regardless of sex or previous condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It seems clear that the term “young men”, used in the prophecy, means the younger brethren of Christ Jesus, regardless of sex, because no sex distinction is recognized in Christ. (Gal. 3:28) “Young men” is a term symbolically used to denote strong, vigorous, active and zealous ones in the Lord and in his service, regardless of age. “Old men” symbolically represents those who are listless, dreamy, and indifferent to what is to be done or is being done. It is the “young men”, that is to say, the active ones in the Lord's service, who see visions. A vision means a clearer understanding of God’s purpose; and those who see and understand are moved with a zealous devotion to the Lord, and they serve joyfully. “Where there is no vision, the people perish.’’ (Prov. 29:18) True Christians must feed upon and understand God’s Word in order to be joyful and vigorous, and therefore be </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">young.—</span><span class="font3">Amos 8:11-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those who have been brought into the temple condition and have kept abreast with the light of the truth </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font3">God has revealed it to his people have grown strong in the Lord and continue to rejoice in serving him. Such are the ones whom the Lord specifically uses to give testimony to his name. These are the ones who </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font3">taken out from the Gentile nations as a people for Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As bearing upon the time of the fulfillment of this prophecy, it is written: “And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the Lord come.”—Joel 2:30,31; Acts 2:19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The physical facts show the fulfillment of this prophecy since the coming of the Lord to his temple in 1918. It is since that time that the Lord has revealed to his people the signs and wonders in heaven, that is to say, has given them a better vision or understanding of the Devil’s organization (the one sign) and of the birth of the Lord’s kingdom (the other sign).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">He has also shown them the fact that the adversary Satan has now been cast out of heaven and the preparation for the final war upon earth is on. “Blood and fire” are symbols of death and destruction. In the earth during the past few years there has been a great amount of death and material destruction. “Smoke” is an evidence of destruction in progress. So-called “organized Christianity” is rapidly disintegrating. The leaders thereof have “turned into darkness” the light of the gospel by denying the creation of man as perfect, and denying the fall of man and his redemption by the blood of Jesus, and by openly uniting with the Devil’s organization in declaring the League of Nations as God’s kingdom on earth. Their work is destructive of faith in God, and they themselves no longer shine as the sun of light and prosperity. The “moon”, as used in Joel’s prophecy, is a symbol of the light of God’s truth amidst the darkness of earth’s night. It has become unto man a message of God’s vengeance by the death of his enemies, and this is shown by the moon’s being turned into blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These things have come to pass particularly in the few years just passed, and are apparent to all who have the vision of God’s purpose. The prophet says that these things shall take place “before the great and the terrible day of the Lord come”. That means before the final war and trouble mentioned by Jesus in his great prophecy in which he calls it the “great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be”. (Matt. 24:21) The prophecy says that, contemporaneously with the happening of these events, God will pour out his spirit upon all flesh and upon whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, and that these shall bear testimony to the name of the Lord. The physical facts show that this prophecy is in course of complete fulfillment. This further identifies the witnesses who are taken out as a people for God’s name.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark15"></a>GOD’S GOVERNMENT WILL BRING PEACE</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH has in store boundless blessings and benefits for those who love and obey him. Such benefits he will bestow upon the people during the administration of his government. In this day, when there is great distress and perplexity among the people of earth, the Lord permits the honest seeker for truth to have a vision of some of the benefits that he will soon give unto men. By faith his prophet saw those blessings coming, and he exclaimed: “Bless the Lord, 0 my soul, and forget not all his benefits.” (Ps. 103:2) To those who now desire to see righteousness amongst the peoples of the earth it will be of great satisfaction to obtain some knowledge that these blessings are near at hand. That knowledge is now obtainable from the Scriptures in the light of presentday events. It is God’s due time. Among the great benefits that God’s government will bestow upon the people are these: peace, security, welfare, plenty, health, strength and life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The governments of earth that are in the League of Nations are putting forth at least an outward effort to bring about peace and security. They will not succeed even though they use their best endeavors honestly. In fact the League of Nations is a makeshift and an attempt to quiet the public demand for peace. The people want peace, and to them the League of Nations is like a straw to a drowning man. Seeing nothing else, they reach out for it. Satan induced the nations to adopt the League; and his purpose in so doing is to turn the minds of the people away from God and to keep them more completely under his ow n evil control. Jehovah foreknew and foretold this action and the fate of the League of Nations in these words: “Associate yourselves, 0 ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand; for God is with us.”—Isa. 8: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The official record of the United States Congress, under date of March 5, 1928, is authority for the statement that “over eighty-two percent of all the revenues of the United States are now expended in support of military policies; and unless this nation becomes engaged in war with some other people internal combustion will be inevitable”. No people of earth are greater lovers of peace than those of the United States. Why, then, is their money being spent in such great amount to make ready for war? All the other nations are putting forth their best endeavors to prepare for war, yet all the nations vow they do not want war. Satan, the evil invisible ruler, is at this time forcing the governments of earth into this condition and gathering them to the great battle of Armageddon, even as the Lord foretold. (Rev. 16: 13-16) These facts must now be brought to the attention of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The common people of one nation do not foment war against the common people of another nation. The common people who bear the burdens of war are not even consulted about it. A few men who have to do with the responsibilities of government decide that war is necessary for commercial reasons or for the purpose of satisfying some supposed or real grievance. Diplomatic notes are passed between these nations and an attempt is made to adjust the difficulties. After solemn deliberation a formal declaration of war is made by one nation against another. The warmakers remain at home while the common people, who are ignorant of the cause of the war, are hurried to the front to suffer and die. If two private citizens pass notes one to the other in an attempt to settle their difficulties and then both agree to meet upon the field and wttle their difficulties with deadly weapons, and one of them dies, the survivor is charged and convicted of murder in the first degree. Nations are made up of many people and controlled by a few men. It may then with propriety be asked, Where is there any difference between the crime committed by two men and that by two hundred men? When after deliberation a few men who have to do with the management of their respective governments attempt a settlement of differences upon the field with deadly weapons, they call it “war”. But those who are the most prominent in bringing about the conflict and engineering it are decorated with badges of honor. If the warmakers alone were killed, that would be bad enough; but when without their consent millions of innocent men must die, that condition is far worse. When more millions of men, women and babes must suffer, the horror of war is indescribable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A young man, loving peace and home, takes a wife, whom he loves. Before them the prospects seemingly are bright. He has not noticed the war cloud threatening because of the negotiations between the governments. Suddenly war is declared; without warning he is drafted, torn away from his young wife, and hurried to the front. The wife suffers great fear and agony and under this miserable condition her babe is born. The order comes from the government that the food supply must be conserved and therefore even the babes must be limited in the quantity consumed. The profiteers corner the food and boost the prices. The wife is unable to buy food for herself or her babe. She sees her babe wasting away for want of sufficient nourishment. It dies without its father’s ever seeing it and while that father is upon the battlefield trying to kill, or be killed. If he survives he returns broken in body and health and finds his youthful wife aged from sorrow and starvation. Their honeymoon was like a flower blooming in the early morning, quickly cut down and wasted before the sun is scarcely up. There are millions of families on earth today who have suffered from the ravages of war. It is no wonder that, early in 1928, a monster petition was signed by a great multitude of the common people in England and presented to the government, declaring that they would not again respond in case of another war. The people want peace; but the prediction is freely made that when another war is declared they will respond because they arc commanded so to do and they are put in fear and in jeopardy by the governments if they fail to respond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">War engenders hatred. Intense selfishness develops into hatred. Long suffering and oppression produce hatred. Injustice continued upon mankind produces hatred. Governments of this world have been in a large measure responsible for the hatred bred and cultivated amongst men. Behind the governments is Satan, the Wicked One, who has planted hatred and war in the hearts of the people by cultivating in them, and especially in the governments, extreme selfishness. Love must be planted in the hearts of the, people in the place of hatred. Hatred is like a heart of stone. Love will make the hearts of the people tender and gentle. Love is unselfishness made manifest. One of the great benefits the people will have under the righteous government of God is that he will stop all war and then plant love in the hearts of the people. Lasting peace will be the result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Through his prophet God foretells of the establishment of his righteous government, exalting it above all the governments of the earth, and declaring that unto it the nations shall flow: “And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the [government] of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways [the truth], and we will walk in his paths [of righteousness] ; for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord fiom Jerusalem. And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; and they sha'l beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. ’ ’—Isa. 2:3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God is love. All of his laws for men can be met and obeyed by those who are unselfish. “Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.” (Rom. 13:10) With respect to the time when his government is in full sway in the earth God says of and concerning the people: “They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain [kingdom]: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea. Isa. 11: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Concerning his King, whom God has placed upon his throne, and who shall rule the world, it is written: ‘‘The government shall be upon his shoulder.” He is the Prince of Peace, and of his government and peace there shall be no end. (Isa. 9: G, 7) Then ‘‘the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen [nations] ; and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth”. (Zech. 9:10) That will mean to the peoples of earth universal peace. The horrors of war will be gone for ever and there will never be another war. That benefit to the people cannot be adequately described in words. When the people know and understand this truth they will sing for joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The animals of the mountains and the forest are at enmity with man. They try to kill man and man kills them. Under the righteous government of the Lord peace shall be for ever established between even tiic wild beasts and man. God, of course, knows the language of the animals and of the fowls of the air and he will speak to them in their own language and quiet their fear of man, and peace will be for ever established between the wild beasts and man. ‘‘And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow, and the sword, and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.” (Iios. 2:18) Concerning his righteous government and the benefits of peace that it will bring, it is written: “And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins. The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf, and the young lion, and the fading together; and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice’ den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain [government] : for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.”—Isa. 11:5-9.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark17"></a>MEMORIAL</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font3">HE date foi' the celebration to the name of Jehovah God and to the sacrifice of Christ Jesus is determined in this manner: From the observation of the new moon nearest to the vernal equinox, which marks the first day of the first month, count fourteen days. (Ex. 12:1-6) According to astronomical calculations the moon rises at least sixteen hours before it can be seen with the natural eye of man. In the time of Moses the calculation was made from the hour he could see the moon with the naked eye, and that is the proper manner for us to count the time. This year (called A.D. 1936) begins on the 24th day of March; and the fourteenth day, to wit, after 6 p.m. of April 6, is the proper time for the celebration of the Memorial. Jerusalem time is used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The book entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font3"> contains a more detailed explanation of the Memorial than </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3">could carry at one issue. Carefully and prayerfully study chapters two and three of the book entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah,</span><span class="font3"> beginning at page 2G and ending at page 120. Then on the 6th day of A]&gt;ril, after 6 p.m., let each company of the anointed assemble and celebrate the Memorial. In doing so, use unleavened bread and real red wine. Unfermented grape juice or raisin juice will not meet the requirements. The Lord and the apostles used real red wine, and we should follow their lead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 50)</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH’S MARVELOUS WORKS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Human words fail me to express my deep gratitude to Jehovah our God for hi»marvelous works in behalf of his visible oiganization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Particularly for the past six months Satan the Devil has been doing all in Ins power to browbeat and discourage Jehovah’s witnesses of this area. But in the face of such opposition the witnesses are carrying the battle to the gate of the enemy with greater zeal, peculiar to the house of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For several months certain towns were closed to the witness walk. Late-last summer the Society gave the word and .every one of these places was forced open. Since that these places have been coveted three and four times with the kingdom message. It seems that every bulwark of Satan’s oiganization crumbles before the onward match of our King. The divisional campaigns are used by the Lord, m giving to the Devil’s crowd a ciushing blow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For the last several months the great enemy has been making a great onslaught against Jehovah’s witnesses of this area. Not being able to down the couiage and cool the zeal of Jehovah’s people, he found an “occasion against’’ the ones who thus far maintained their integrity toward God. Some of the children of Jehovah’s witnesses and Jonadabs refused to take part in tlic flag-saluting exercises in the public schools. This gave a good excuse to the “dollai” patriots. Immediately the school authorities passed local rulings in order to expel the children of God’s people. Parents and children were arrested and unjust judges imposed fines or impi isonment upon parents because they would not send the childicn to school. At Nemacolin [Pa.] the par&lt; nts of two children weie arrested for violating school laws after the school board oflii mHv expelled the chil-dn-n. Such gloss injustice boiled red blood of some true Americans, as hundreds of letteis of piotest against such cruel, devilish piactices of the school boards were published and still are being published tn the local papers of this division.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We were in perplexity for a time, but every move made by Jehovah through his oiganization outwitted the enemy; thus they got into a mess, and did not know how to get out of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The article in December 1 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">H'atthtoirir,</span><span class="font2"> “Expelling Children from School,’’ removed all our perplexities. Praise Jehovah therefor. On the fourth of December our first Kingdom .School opened at Adah (Gates), Pa., with 15 children. On the ninth of December the number increased to 22. Now it is a going concern. The school opens with “Bethel Exercises’’, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Ilaip</span><span class="font2"> is a part of their daily curriculum. W'e are waiting anxiously for that publication specially for the benefit of the great multitude. At Monessen, Pa., our second Kingdom School will be opened on the sixteenth of December. Witlnn a very short time Kingdom (School Number 3 will be opened for the benefit of Canonsburg children. Thus all the children in this area that aie expelled from school shall be taken care of. Praise ye the Lord!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In connection with our Society’s annual business meeting the Society arranged for a service convention. W’e are glad to inform you that 105 Jonadabs symbolized their consecration by water immersion. Also, we were much pleased to know that the president of our Society and the other servants thereof were ie-elected to their respective offices by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font2"> the votes cast. Such a unity of mind, heart and couise of action has never been made manifest heretofore among the people of Jehovah.— Psalm 133.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Wishing Jehovah’s richest blessing to continue to be your portion for ever, with fervent love and best wishes, I am</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your brother and fellow servant,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">S. H. </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Toutjian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">GREATEST PRIVILEGE EVER GIVEN</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Our dear Brethren and Fellow Servants</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">in Jehovah’s Service:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Greetings to you all in the name of tire Most High God, and our best wishes to all in tae progress of the kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have been informed, through Brother Rutherford’s letter of November 5, of the wonderful and gracious provision made in behalf of-the pionecis. We wish to express our heartfelt gratitude and thanks to all of you for that provision. There are many things at this time to be thankful for, but some things mean more to us than otheis. W’e want to'thank each of you for the sacrifice you have made in order to make it possible for us to keep going in the service. It will be a great aid in keeping us in the field and better equipped to carry the message to those hungering for the truth, and, of course, also to those who are not hungenng for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As you stated, Brother Rutherford, it will be more “advantageous”; it will be a “stimulus”; and it does bring to our minds that the gicutest pnvilegc ever given any creature on earth is the publishing ot the kingdom message. That is why we are so thankful to ihe Lord Jehovah and his Vindicator and to all of jou for making such a provision for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The burdens in the field are often heavy, and we often get somewhat discouraged. But then we see the wonderful privilege before us and how the Lord provides for us and we brace up and rejoice and start the cry anew—For Jehovah and lor Gideon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">W'e therefore join in thanking all of you again anil in extending our love and best wishes to all at headquarters. May Jehovah nelily bless Jou in all your endeavors to serve him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your fellow servants,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Or.Liviai </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Siebenlist, Mrs.</span><span class="font2"> O. </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Siebenlist, Mrs.</span><span class="font2"> W. G. </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Eisenmann, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nebraska.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WILL CONTINUE TO MARCH ON</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brethren at Bethel:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">W'e, the undersigned, are writing to express our noblest appreciation to the Society for tho gracious provision made for the pioneers in your letter of November 5. Surely this was prompted in no other way than for your love and honor for Jehovah's name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This reminds us of John 15: 8, “Herein is my Father gloii-fied, that ye bear much fiuit,” and we know this provision will aid us greatly in bearing the kingdom fnnts to the people, and to continue on joyfully and boldly proclaiming the mi -.s-tigc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">W’e wish to thank Biothcr Rutherfoid and the Bethel family for aiding us in this way, and assure you that, by Jehovah’s grace, we will continue to march on with the King of Eternity while pushing the battle to the gate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">May Jehovah’s guidance, protection and blessing be upon you all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your fellow servants, For Jehovah and for Gideon,</span></p>
