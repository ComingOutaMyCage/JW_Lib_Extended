<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Manufacture of Public Opinion</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font7">LMOST all newspapers are owned by men who have obtained large fortunes by other means, and wish to retain their holdings, and to increase them, and to make themselves appear as public benefactors while engaged in the art of removing what was overlooked in the first haul. The editors and reporters are up against it; they have to do what they are told or look for work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It must have been a hard job for some of the honest newspapermen of the world to chronicle the fall of Madrid every day for four months, and yet it did not fall for all that time, despite the pressure brought to bear by Italy and Germany on behalf of the pope, in whose interest the war by Franco and his Moorish mercenaries was undertaken.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A Clear Case of Infidelity</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Twice a week during all that long period EAQ was cheerfully broadcasting the Truth all over the world. It is a pleasure to reproduce herewith a skit on this subject, written for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font7">by an honest newspaperman:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Over the air waves from war-torn Spain during the heat of the recent invasion of Madrid by the rebels, a voice in the wilderness was heard: a voice that stood out as a messenger of God and peace when many thoughts were for the defense or capture of the Spanish capital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The voice was that of Judge Rutherford, in an electrical transcription coming from Station EAQ in Madrid, Spain. [Shortwave station covering the world]</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Just why the station broadcast Judge Rutherford instead of news of the defense of the capital was not learned. However, by listening to other foreign stations via shortwave it was learned that at the time of the broadcast EAQ was the only station that could have settled a controversy as to whether Madrid had been captured by the rebels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Berlin reported that Madrid had been taken. London broadcast that the rebels had been driven back seven miles and for the time being the capital was safe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But EAQ, in the heart of Madrid, unmindful of the death and destruction going on within a few miles, presented Judge Rutherford, December 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why, no one here knows from explanations, but maybe the officials of that station realize the only way to obtain peace among nations and happiness.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Newspapers Sicken</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Their Own Readers </span><span class="font7">In the effort to toady</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy the newspapers of the world have sickened their own readers. Far better than to lie to them, as they have done, deliberately and willfully, they might have reproduced from Catholic sources such admissions as that made by the Reverend Wilfred Parsons, S.J., quoted by Right Reverend John A. Ryan, D.D., in an address at Washington, D.C., October 8, 1936. This citation is all the more to the point because it was the Jesuits, of whom Parsons is one, and the Roman Catholic</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Church, of whom he is one, that made Spain what it is:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The great tragedy of Spain was that in the nineteenth century the working masses apostatized from the Church, as Pope Pius X once remarked. And it is well to remember, it was poverty, destitution and injustice which made them apostatize. They got to hate the Church because they hated the friends of the Church, who exploited them and whom the Church did nothing to rebuke or correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As early as November 8, 1936, decorations were up in both Rome and Vatican City in joyful anticipation of the early fall of Madrid. At the end of the year the city was still in the hands of the Spanish Republic.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19361230_files/g_E_19361230-3.png" alt="" style="width:228pt;height:270pt;">
<p><span class="font5">The Unannounced Feature</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Viscount Churchill, back in Britain from Spain, was impressed with the fact that so few of the papers tell the truth about the Spanish situation. On a certain day he, with three British statemen, called on President Azana and remained with him for over an hour. On that very day the Fascist (Catholic Action) spokesman Quepo de Llano broadcast the absurd “news” that Azana was in the hands of Communists and persons who had attempted to “reach” him had been killed in the attempt. De Llano may reflect that not everybody could tell as big a lie as that, but it may also be added that few would wish to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Naturally the Catholic press of Spain has the pope’s “blessing”. And his blessing works—backwards. A correspondent in Madrid, Spain, writing July 25, says of the newspaper </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">El Debate:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The pope blessed all the Catholic press, and this paper in particular at the beginning of the month, and sec how wonderfully it has worked. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Debate</span><span class="font6"> had the fastest rotary press in Europe. Now the Communists are printing their paper there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Apparently neither the pope nor the press has learned anything from the World War. At that time </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> group of American newspapermen in Belgium were overtaken by the German advance, and remained with the German army thereafter. While there a bundle of Allied newspapers fell into their hands. They were astounded and shocked by what they read. These men, Irvin S. Cobb, John T. McCutcheon, O’Donnell Bennett, Roger Lewis, and Harry Hansen, jointly dispatched a cable to The Associated Press, vigorously protesting its atrocities stories. They reported that after two weeks with the German army they had witnessed no mistreatment of prisoners or noncombatants, nor any instances of unprovoked reprisals. But the false propaganda policy of The Associated Press continued unabated. Thus it is morally guilty of murdering thousands of young Americans, who would not have so recklessly thrown away their lives if they had known the truth. —Merrill B. Knapp, Washington.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In his book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of the Press</span><span class="font7"> George Seldes pays his respects to The Associated Press as follows :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Associated Press,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">in short, seems always on the side of authority: it appears to make no difference to this great organization whether authority is a great president or a crooked secretary of the interior, a bloodthirsty dictator or a mild constitutional ruler, a city policeman or a steel companj’ ’s hired thug.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That is just another way of saying that if The Associated Press had been in existence in the days of the Son of God, Jesus Christ, it would have been against Him, even as it is in this day against Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Seldes further states that</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Associated Press has employed ultra-Faseists to report on Fascism, strikebreakers to report on strikes, army and marine officers to report on ‘traitors’ they were fighting in Nicaragua and Haiti and reactionaries to report movements for political justice and freedom throughout the world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">It should be particularly noted that this same press invariably refers to Amleto Cicognani, the pope’s representative, as “Apostolic Delegate to the United States’’, giving the impression that he has been officially recognized, and the very purpose of such misleading designations undoubtedly is to give the public that impression, though it is well known that this man occupies no such position as is suggested by his title, and his contact is or should be limited to representatives of the sect of which he is a proponent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Dear Sir)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">I was in the New York and Jersey City area a couple week* ago on business. At about that same time it appears that there was a company of people known as Jehovah's Witnesses &quot;holding a convention in the area of Jersey City, I heard it rumored that eone of these people were arrested in your city for distributing bible literature, naturally I thought that must be a Joke as we certainly are not living under the rule of the Roman Catholic Cnuach of the year 1500 A.D. Somehow these rumors got under my skin and I investigated further and found that it was the truth that many of these people had been arrested and given from ten to thirty days in Jail,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">I knew that Hitler of Germany was a dictator but darned if X knew we had one in New Jersey, If I know anything about the constitution of the United States and the State of New Jersey anyone has a right to worship God the way ho or she pleases,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">If you don't know about this situation for .goodness sake investigate and do so at once and whoever is responsible for these arrests should ba put behind the bars themselves,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">If you know about it and have tolerated it then I would suggest that you advise the road commissioners to place DETOUR signs so people can get where they are going without traveling thru Jersey City, If you dont do this for goodness sake have someone sell clothes pins on alln the leading-highways coming into Jersey City, and the tourists can clap something over their noses while passing thru your olty.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">marks about the work of this loud-mouthed multimillionaire’s activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was a group of Hearst photographers, crowding Lindbergh’s car to the curb, and thrusting a camera into little Jon’s face, that so disgusted Colonel Lindbergh and his wife that they fled from America to a land where decent people still have some liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some of the reasons why Hearst is so militaristic are that he has a rapidly growing fortune of $220,000,000 which, it is no doubt his inward thought, is to endure forever, and he wishes to make sure that it will be protected; also that his holdings contain about $15,000,000 of interest in copper mines, and every shell that is made will improve the value of those holdings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">His widely advertised “National Conference of Clergymen and Laymen” in Asheville, N.C., was the most complete flop of any “convention” ever held in the United States. There was no cohesion among the delegates; they started out with a spolit, and at the last meeting, which was to have been the grand climax of the convention, there was nobody present but the speakers. This convention was tooted up all over the United States as the thing that was going to save the country from “Communism”. It is to laugh. It could not even save itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Columbia Lmiversity 200 members of William Randolph Hearst Post No. 1, Veterans of Future Wars, paraded behind a band, the leader of which used a crutch for a baton. The Future Veterans are demanding their bonus now and making all America laugh at the Monarch of San Simeon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A few of the better salaried in America are William Randolph Hearst at $500,000 a year, Mae West at $333,166.65, Arthur Brisbane at $265,000, and four officials of the American Tobacco Company at a total of $637,951 among them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">An Interesting Phenomenon</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the most interesting phenomena of the times is the betrayal of the people by the newspapers. Despite the certain knowledge that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is the world's greatest foe of human liberty, not a chance is let slip to pose that same Hierarchy before the people as the grandest, most sublime institution on earth. The pettiness is astounding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus, when the big news came of the arrest, July 18, 1935, of M. C. Harbeck, by the secret police of Germany it was concealed from the people that he was one of Jehovah’s witnesses, of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, and though it was grudgingly admitted that he is a prominent “Protestant minister”, the whole story in the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Journal,</span><span class="font7"> in which the account first appeared, was put under glaring headlines about the “persecutions” of Catholics in Germany, which persecutions are almost if not entirely camouflage.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19361230_files/g_E_19361230-4.png" alt="" style="width:229pt;height:273pt;">
<p><span class="font5">‘Belshazzar’s Feast’</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">The next morning, in the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">American,</span><span class="font7"> the same item appeared under glaring headlines “Hitler Orders Police Drive on Catholics”, but it was sandwiched in the middle of the article between two imaginary “reports” of contemplated action against Catholics. The effect upon the casual reader would be that the arrest of Harbeck was in some way an attack on the Catholics who were thereby being persecuted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No mention is ever made in the metropolitan papers of the maltreatment of Jehovah’s witnesses in New Jersey. In other words, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">yellow </span><span class="font7">press of today is definitely on the side of the Devil and committed to him, body and soul, to do his will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Tinies</span><span class="font7"> had a decent and honorable report of Harbeck’s arrest; so also the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">World-T elegram;</span><span class="font7"> but in both the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font7"> and the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font7"> the camouflage was complete. Probably the fact is that Gog, the invisible prime minister of the Devil, caused the report of prospective attacks upon the Catholics to be circulated so that when he had nabbed Harbeck those who are given over wholly to the Devil might do just what the editors of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font7"> did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Lovers of Lies</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Nazi papers love to lie, and hence the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Fraenliische Tagessei-tung,</span><span class="font7"> of Nuremberg, Germany, took great pleasure in publishing the absolute falsehood that the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses is Communistic- Jewish, financed by a Jewish banker and directed by a Jew. These lies were retailed in a story of the fact that of nineteen of Jehovah’s witnesses tried at Fuerth, Bavaria, five were acquitted and fourteen were sentenced to prison for terms ranging from three months to one year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The pope is very enthusiastic about the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Catholic press. In his eyes, according to his own preachments, it bears a most important relation “to the successor of Peter, the rock and foundation of the church and perpetual voice and guardian of its teaching”. The Catholic press is composed of “the most eloquent interpreters of the mind of the Vicar of Christ”. He assured the Catholic editors, “The director of your work is God the Creator.” He tells the editors, “You will first lay hold of the priests” and “by stirring the interest of the priests you will be able to awaken the people”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The pope says of the press that antagonizes the Catholic press that it is &quot;an attack that is carried on by an abundant and copious diffusion of literature, an attack that is carried on in the full and open light”; that &quot;it is a great danger, a supreme and universal danger. It will continue in its universal appeal and will proclaim itself openly by a propaganda that will spare nothing.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Stooge</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Hon. W. D. McFarlane, in an address in the House of Representatives, at Washington, told of the great achievements of the Vernon (Texas) municipal lighting plant, one of the most successfully owned and operated plants in Texas. They have built their own beautiful city hall, worth more than $100,000, largely out of the earnings of the plant; they make no charge for lighting streets, parks, football and baseball grounds, municipal building and library. They furnish free lights to some charity cases; they make a flat rate to business houses, and, finally, says Mr. McFarlane: “The municipal light plant at Vernon represents an actual investment of approximately $450,000, entirely out of debt, all paid for out of plant earnings. The citizens of Vernon have a very efficient plant, and their light rates are among the. lowest rates of any city in the State. In spite of this enviable record they have had the bitter opposition of the Power Trust and their own daily newspaper.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Georgia is making educational progress. At Decatur boy’s high school a dog was graduated with 78 boys, because he had always attended class with his young master. Some of Jehovah's witnesses have been jailed in Georgia for trying to enlighten the people with reference to the Bible; educational work of the highest order. Newspaper stories showed marked respect for the dog; none for the true and faithful witnesses of Jehovah.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>Editorial Unfairness</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font7"> is always ready, as are other papers, to devote columns of slop to bequests, sometimes running into the millions, that are made to the most destructive, deadly heresy in the world, the Roman Catholic. Yet the following is the full representation of a story about a bequest to the cause of simple truth: </span><span class="font6">Odd Bequest; Boro T j Magazine Shares Reader’s Estate. A woman in Tipton, Iowa, who kept to her bed for forty years in protest to the manner in which her father-in-law’s estate was settled, has bequeathed 60 percent of her small fortune to Brooklyn’s religious publication, The Watch Tower. Editors of the magazine said that they had seen press dispatches from Tipton explaining the bequest but said they had not yet seen the money. According to reliable correspondence the woman was Mrs. Mary W. Wickham and her estate totalled about $10,000 at the time of her recent death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Other newspapers did their best to ridicule this woman and to make her appear a fanatic, and the story was written up with many fanciful details. If it had been a Catholic making a bequest</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">to her “church” she would have been represented as a ‘secluded saint, withdrawn from the world’. Says the Washington </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font7"> (the same paper that refused to print Judge Rutherford’s address on “Government”, though they had it in type, and had in their possession a check for $1,371.51 to pay for its publication as an “advertisement”) :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In early Christian times the Roman rabble blamed the Christians for every untoward event that hap-</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">pened, even that “Christians dominate the state and that they are everywhere”. For every damage done the Christians were blamed. When the Tiber overflowed its banks, drought came, an earthquake, a famine, the cry always arose: ‘ ‘ Throw the Christians to the lions. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Nobody need think that the newspapers do not have influence. They do. And frequently that influence is used for evil, as in the case of the Fresno (Calif.) </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Bee.</span><span class="font7"> This malicious Catholic sheet has been responsible for the persecution of many of Jehovah’s little ones in the San Joaquin valley, causing their expulsion from school. One little chap, Vernon Mikkelsen, of the Walnut school district, a lovable little fellow, gave a fine account of himself among the small-souled and bigmouthed patriots of his community, even referring his persecutors to the three Hebrew children who likewise suffered because of their loyalty to Jehovah. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Bee</span><span class="font7"> was responsible for the dastardly persecution of a child, and then lied about it after it was done. They stated that he had called himself a “Russellite”, a patent falsehood. Continuing faithful, Vernon will have everlasting life, and the responsible parties of the Fresno </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Bee</span><span class="font7"> will get just what they deserve.—2 Thessalonians 1:9.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Said M. S. Key, in the Birmingham (Ala.) </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Post:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I have been reading of arrests of religious people in Lagrange, Ga. If this were happening in Russia, our daily press would cry out against religious persecution. So far I have not seen one editorial against this practice. What is wrong?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Post,</span><span class="font6"> as well as other newspapers, has openly condemned the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany. Others have condemned the action of the Mexican government against the Roman Catholic rule in Mexico. Yet here in good old United States of America we have people arrested for distributing religious literature, and our press remains strangely silent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I do not believe in all these people teach, but our forefathers came to this country for religious and political freedom. They came here to escape persecution. Are our religious and political bosses afraid for the people to read and think for themselves ? I imagine Christ would be called a Red if he were here on earth today and preached as he did back in Biblical days. I am sure he would condemn a religious and political setup that has us in the grips of debt, usury, hypocrisy and acute capitalism, which is slowly but surely carrying us toward Fascism, chaos and national destruction.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Butting Heads Against the Posts</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">In the second edition of the Pittsburgh </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">PostGazette</span><span class="font7"> of Monday, December 2, 1935, appeared the good news that the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom had protested against compulsory flag saluting, as it could only result in “hypocrisy on the part of the children”. But does anybody suppose the Jesuits who control America’s press could let an item like that stand? It did not appear in the final edition of the paper.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font6">ate that front-page more-than-a-column story sent out from East Orange, N. J., boosting magistrate Martin J. McHugh for “his humane and frequently scintillating decisions in police court cases”. Jehovah’s witnesses are well aware of the humanity and scintillating brilliance of this magistrate, because he sent some 30 of their number to prison under sentences of 130 days each for handing printed sermons to householders of that city. This was never done before, even in New Jersey. The desire of the writer of the article which appeared in your issue of August 18 to do all in his power to paint Mr. McHugh as a gentleman of probity and justice is apparent from the following language</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">which he reported Mr. McHugh as using in the dismissal of six men of the average of 63 years who were brought before him on the charge of gambling, and you are asked to judge whether or not this pretty language was fixed up for the newspapers, or whether it is from the heart of the man that broke up the homes of large numbers of law-abiding Christian men and women for no just reason at all for the cruel and illegal and beastly term of 130 days in prison:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The defendants are not criminals: they have never exhibited any criminal tendencies. Rummy games played for penny stakes seem to me to be an innocent pastime and not a vicious activity threatening the structure of the State or of society. If these men are guilty of a crime, then it is my opinion that we must return to the measures of a more unenlightened day and set up stocks for our lawbreakers at the corner of Main and Day streets. I find the defendants not guilty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Baltimore Sun” in that editorial. If those editors had searched the files of journalism they might not have been so hasty in cataloguing ‘‘The Sun” as ‘‘muddleheaded”. Each year the University of Missouri, the finest institution in the world in the teaching of journalism, awards prizes to the newspapers of the world. In 1931 the first award went to “The Manchester Guardian” and second prize to “The Baltimore Sun” for its brilliant, fearless and constructive liberal attitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Josephine E. Fuente, of Trinidad, British West Indies, calling attention to the banning of all Watch Tower publications in that colony, says in a letter to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The People</span><span class="font7"> of that city:</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">An Editor with a Backbone</span></p>

J., is an editor with a backbone. In the issue of November 14, 1935, he published a good editorial on the folly of trying to force patriotism by rules and regulations of flag saluting. His enemies, and the enemies of Jehovah’s witnesses, took the matter up and lined up all the politicians and professional patriots they could control, making a wholesale attack upon him in the columns of their papers.

<p><span class="font5">The Comic Strip That the Public Is Waiting For</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">Inacommunity like this, where public taste for literature is alleged to be growing to the extent that one of our well-known librarians is being offered a scholarship abroad for the purpose of broadening his ideas on literary taste so as to meet the requirements of the public, one finds it strange that the Government should take such a step: for let it be known that the Watch Tower publications have for the past two or three years won high literature prizes in Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font7">said editorially: “Seldom can the world have been in such a condition of puzzled uncertainty as today. Everywhere we see in</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">stood to his guns. He reprinted the editorial two weeks later, backed it up by similar editorials from the Cincinnati </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Enquirer,</span><span class="font7"> the Raleigh (N.C.) </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">News and Observer, The Nation,</span><span class="font7"> the Birmingham (Ala.) </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Age-Herald,</span><span class="font7"> the Rochester (N.Y.) </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Democrat and Chronicle,</span><span class="font7"> the Dallas (Tex.) </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Dispatch,</span><span class="font7"> the St. Louis </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Star-Times,</span><span class="font7"> and the Seattle </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Star,</span><span class="font7"> and in an advertisement said further:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Maybe the Press of the Nation is Wrong. The editors of the three local newspapers, “The Observer,” “The Plain Dealer” and “The Record”, last week referred to a quoted editorial appearing in The Leader as “muddle-headed comment”. We gave credit to “The </span><span class="font7">individuals and rulers in doubt what to think, what to say, what to do.” This expression agrees exactly with our Lord's great prophecy of conditions that would prevail at the end of the world, one of the designations of which was that there would be “upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity”. Now and then the Press seems to recognize and admit the truth.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Roman Press Methods</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Osservatore Romano,</span><span class="font7"> Vatican organ, on the morning of the American election, November 3, came out strongly for Roosevelt. The difference in time between Vatican City and New York is about five hours; so it was about midnight, Monday, November 2, at New York city when this matter was published. It takes only a moment in these days for news to be flashed to all quarters, and on the morning of November 3 almost every Catholic in the United States knew how to vote for the pope's choice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Efforts on the part of Rome to censor the news sometimes have ludicrous results. This was shown in the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font7"> where an article by Lord Dickinson demanded that the pope say something to show that he was against the Italian murder campaign. This demand of Dickinson was given the following headline, which is as silly under the circumstances as any ever written: “Stand by the Pope Against Italian Aggression Urged by Lord, Scoring Inaction.’’ The casual reader, glancing at the headline, will form the impression that the pope has taken a stand against Italian aggression, and that others stand with him. The pope has taken no such stand. He and Mussolini are in cahoots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is liberty (freedom of the press) today in the British Isles, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, The Netherlands, and Switzerland; there is partial liberty in France, Portugal, Belgium, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Czechoslovakia ; and there is no liberty at all in Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Albania, Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, Rumania, Poland, and Russia. Several attempts have been made during the past three years to restrict the liberty of the press in the United States. Liberty-lovers have repeatedly called attention to bills having that end in view; none of them thus far have passed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Chester H. Rowell, editor of San Francisco </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle,</span><span class="font7"> explaining the general disappearance of liberty from the earth, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The very first liberty the dictator suppresses is that of the press. Behind the screen of falsehood and ignorance which this suppression makes possible he then destroys all the other liberties of the people.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>How Catholic Editors Love to Lie!</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">There is no defense against a lying tongue, and small satisfaction, therefore, in reiterating the fact that Catholic editors are the biggest liars alive. Their “faith” makes them that way. Flowever, just to expose one more batch of their lies to public gaze, here is what the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Bulletin,</span><span class="font7"> St. Paul, Minnesota, has to say on the subject of the Petition. As usual, it contains five lies, accompanied by the usual admission that the average Catholic, even when he has a statement in front of him in black and white, cannot be expected to know what he is signing. His “faith” works that way:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Do not sign any radio petitions. Father Corrigan of St. Mark’s parish has brought to our notice another attempt of the followers of “Judge” Rutherford to enlist by a subterfuge Catholic support for this notorious enemy of the churches, Catholic and Protestant. This is the procedure: A man or a woman calls at a house and inquires if there are any Catholics present. If the answer is “yes” they are asked to sign a petition to permit a “well-known Catholic priest to talk on the radio”. One woman who was approached examined the petition and discovered that the supposed priest is named “Rutherford”. Father Corrigan said that many Catholics were deceived and signed the petition. Rutherford heads groups that call themselves the “Watchtower Bible and Tract Society” and “Jehovah’s witnesses”. His radio talks have been discontinued by all stations of any consequence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Radio Censorship Path to Dictatorship</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Wayne County</span><span class="font7"> (Ill.) </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Press</span><span class="font7"> calls attention to the fact that the logical outcome of the present radio censorship, by which a few persons on the staffs of the National Broadcasting Company and Columbia Broadcasting System decide what 127,000,000 people may hear on the radio, is a dictatorship, and then says, rather significantly:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It doesn't matter whether the Democrats, Republicans or Jehovah’s witnesses hold office. The air should be as free as the press. Once that freedom is impaired, no matter how slightly, the door is opened wide for more abuse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">John H. Frazier, of Oklahoma, writing to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Radio Guide,</span><span class="font7"> said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You quoted the National Broadcasting Company’s president as saying: “Our objectives have been to make available to the American people, entertainment and educational programs of the highest standard, to co-operate with representative educational, religious and cultural organizations. NBC has always maintained American standards of free speech on the air; of fair play for all people, regardless of race or creed, with decency and good taste.” How can the above statement be harmonized with the NBC’s continual refusal to broadcast the Watch Tower programs, even after two and one-half million people signed a petition against such unfair discrimination?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a dispatch from Rome comes the news that after fifty minutes with the pope Will Hays, the movie “co-ordinator”, announced that he and the pope are in full accord on the motion picture industry. How else would they be? Theoretically Hays is a Presbyterian. In spirit he is a “toekisser”. Rumors that Postmaster General Jim Farley is to have Hays’ job are questioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Approved by the Pope</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In this connection an advertisement ten inches long, from the Oakland </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Post-Enquirer,</span><span class="font7"> is of interest. It reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Broadway: Starts Tomorrow; In Natural Color; Legong, Dance of the Virgins; The Naked Truth About Bali . . . Native Love . . . Native Passion Revealed in This Island Paradise; Produced Entirely on the Tropical Island of Bali. And Missing Girls: Roger Pryor, Muriel Evans, Sidney Blackmer; The Sinister Truth . . . About the Woman Racket! A picture that scoops the world with gangster information on why girls leave home . . . and what happens to them. . . . See their terrible fate! First Oakland Showing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the middle of this advertisement, midway between pictures of the two girls who each have on some clothes, but not many, occurs the interesting information, “Approved by the International Federation of Catholic Alumnae.” The pope is very particular that all women who enter his august presence must be dressed “just so”. Is it not a little inconsistent for his henchmen to advertise these pictures (unobjectionable in themselves, even though they show women but slightly clothed) as having papal approval?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What do you think of the idea that the real reason the Roman Catholic Hierarchy grabbed the movies was not to clean them up, for they are not the least bit interested in that, but to gain control of one of the most effective channels of propaganda known to man?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Whatever may be said of editors, seriously or otherwise, it is certain that they wield a wide influence for good or evil. Unfortunately, under present conditions the wide powers of The Associated Press are being employed not for the good of all, but rather for the advantage of the unrighteous powers that dominate the world. On this point </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Pearson’s</span><span class="font7"> magazine well says,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If you can conceive all the power wielded by the autocrats of history, by the Alexanders, Caesars, Tamerlanes, Genghis Khans and Napoleons, to be massed together into one vast unit of power, even this would be less than the pow’er now wielded by The Associated Press. Well-informed men know that the great controlling interests have secured most of the other sources and engines of power. They own and control most of the newspapers, magazines, most of the pulpits, all of the politicians and most of the public men.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">TT </span><span class="font7">OCCASIONALLY happens that some editor more prominent for his lack of wisdom and lack of justice than for his ability to tell the truth gets an eyeful or an earful at the hands of some irate citizen who resents toadying and malice on the part of an editor; and when he does, it is a joy to all who have a spark of American manhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Read the following editorial published in the Rockford (Ill.) </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Register-Republic,</span><span class="font7"> and then read the copy of the letter by Dr. M. J. Eames which follows, and have a laugh at the rag Dr. Eames makes of Mr. T. Barney Thompson. The latter should quit his job and hire out as janitor for some branch of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy—Franciscan Friars, for instance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FORCING FOLKS TO LISTEN</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">News that members of the city council are lending an ear to scores of complaints concerning the sound truck invasion of residential areas of Rockford will be welcomed by those who have found these itinerant broadcasters extremely irritating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It seems reasonable that there should be some control of sound trucks that tour city streets during evening hours, the miracle of amplification carrying a confusing babble over a far-flung area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The procedure of one sound truck operated by local representatives of a Brooklyn “soul saver” has been to pause in the middle of a block while the “canned” voice of the preacher pours out his message, exhorting all within reach of his voice to follow him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If there is any thought on the part of truck operators that there may be within a nearby house someone who lies gravely ill, there is no indication of it. The message, several minutes in length, delivered, the truck moves on to the next block but the loud speaker is still within range of the householder who was in the “front line” during an earlier barrage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are in this modem age many methods available to those who have a message they wish to present to the public. Sending a sound truck into the residential areas on a hot summer night when doors and windows are open can only be construed as the method of those who have failed to win an audience through legitimate channels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They would trap the people in their homes and force them to listen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rockford, Illinois</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">August 3, 1936</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. T. Barney Thompson,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rockford News Tower,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rockford, Illinois</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Mr. Thompson:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Having read the editorial in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Register-Republic</span><span class="font5"> of July 31, 1936, entitled, “Forcing Folks to Listen,” I wonder if you will be fair enough to read the honest opinion of one of the operators of this sound car which you have held up to public ridicule under the guise of helping the oppressed people of Rockford. For nearly a year I have been privileged to work with this sound car and I count it one of the greatest privileges of my entire life. I sincerely believe there are two sides to this question, and if you and your newspaper are open to reason you will be able to see many misstatements of fact. I therefore ask you to give a correct statement to the people of Rockford of the things that I prove are not truthfully represented in your editorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You say “The procedure of one sound truck operated by local representatives of a Brooklyn ‘ soul saver ’ has been to pause in the middle of a block while the ‘canned’ voice of the preacher pours out his message, exhorting all within reach to follow him ’ ’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It seems impossible for those who hate the message of God’s kingdom as given by Judge Eutherford of the Watch Tower to forget their prejudice and calmly and truthfully state the facts. Of course, you may not have written this editorial, but it must have met with your approval or it would not have appeared. I know from past experience with you that you have sufficient feeling on this matter to make it difficult for you to control yourself. I refer to something that happened a number of years ago when I placed a Watch Tower ad with your paper. Although this was a paid advertisement and a perfectly legitimate business transaction, you told me with sufficient feeling for me to remember for years to come, ‘ ‘ I don’t give a whoop for all the International Bible students. ’ ’ That was your privilege then, about ten years ago, and still is, but it should not keep you from giving truthful news items in your paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first untrue statement is your sarcastic reference to Judge Eutherford as a Brooklyn “soul saver”. I have never read any sarcastic remarks in your papers about the Rockford clergymen who are busy continually trying to save souls. You don’t even criticize the priests who have to get paid highly for ‘saving a soul’ from “purgatory” and for ‘forgiving sins’, which you well know is entirely unscriptural and nothing but a racket.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I believe you do know, and if not, you should, that one of the reasons all clergymen hate Judge Eutherford is because he shows that God has not been trying to convert the world and save souls but rather He has been causing a witness to be given about the kingdom Jesus taught us to pray for and during which the name of Jehovah will be completely vindicated and those who desire may be reconciled to God. Therefore since Judge Eutherford does not attempt to save souls and does not teach it as the commission of any Christian, you have, in your desire to ridicule this work, grossly misrepresented this fact, and should correct it publicly. There is a possibility that you were ignorant of this and did not misstate things willfully; but in your next misstatement you cannot receive the benefit of the doubt, because it is reported as something that you know is being done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I refer to your statement that ‘ ‘ the ‘ canned voice ’ of the preacher pours out his message, exhorting all within reach of his voice to follow him”. This can easily be shown to you to be untrue, because we have all these lectures on records, which do not change, and I will gladly bring any and all of them before your entire newspaper staff and before the city council and I challenge you to find one place where Judge Eutherford exhorts anyone to follow him. Bather he urges them not to follow any man but depend on the Word of God instead of traditions of men. It is not necessary to expand on this point, as the records are here, ready for you to use and prove your point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many thousands of people in Rockford have read Judge Eutherford’s books and heard his radio lectures as well as the sound-car lectures and know you are not telling the truth, and what’s better yet, they know why you are not telling the truth. I therefore suggest that it is best for your reputation and that of your newspaper to correct this untrue statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And now for a rather delicate point, Mr. Thompson. Please bear in mind that I am trying to “speak the truth in love”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I do not believe any intelligent editor would refer to the modern invention of electrical transcription now used in all radio stations and other high-class places throughout the world in such a way as you use, ‘ ‘ the ‘ canned voice ’ of the preacher ’ ’, unless he is deliberately trying to belittle the issue and make it appear funny to his readers. However, when wise-cracking on Judge Eutherford’s voice either by radio or electrical transcription it is a very touchy matter, since millions of people know that he has a splendid radio voice. The public knows that Judge Eutherford has millions of listeners and speaks over approximately 300 radio stations each week by electrical transcription, and frequently over such extensive world-wide hookups that the clergymen wonder how he can do this without begging for money as they do. “This is the Lord’s doing; it is marvelous in our eyes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The public also knows that the editor usually speaks over WEOK only, and, believe it or not, Mr. Thompson, I have heard expressions like this, since your editorial appeared, that Judge Eutherford's voice by electrical transcription is superior to your voice when speaking directly over the radio. All of which proves to many people that ‘ ‘ people in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Continuing in the same vein your editorial says, “If there is any thought on the part of truck operators that there may be within a nearby house someone who lies gravely ill, there is no indication of it. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you or your reporter, or more probably a complainant, had spent a few evenings with us in the sound car you would have seen that the best judgment possible is used as to where the sound car is stationed, etc. We do not like to be “bawled out” by anyone for disturbing their peace; so it is natural that we be as considerate as possible. People are not so “gravely ill” all over Rockford, Mr. Thompson, away from hospital zones, that they cannot listen to their radio and even a 44-minute lecture by electrical transcription. Of course, we have found people sick occasionally; someone tells us, and we gladly move away. In operating this car for nearly a year we find that this is not a serious problem at all, and one that is easily handled. It is a beautiful alibi, however, for those who want the sound car discontinued for other reasons;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Again reminding you of the saying about “glass houses”. Why don’t you consider “the gravely ill” people you seem to think are so thickly scattered all over Rockford when your paper sends out newsboys late in the evenings shouting at the top of their voices “Extra, Extra, All About”—something you want to sell. This may hurt a bit, Mr. Thompson, but it proves your editorial is not sincere. You don’t hold up to ridicule the Salvation Army and their band, nor the ringing of the church bells early in the morning which awaken and perhaps disturb the healthy as well as the “gravely ill”. “O consistency, thou art a jewel, ’ ’ but as rare as radium, I guess. There is no need to discuss this point further, because you, or a reporter, are cordially invited to spend a few evenings in our sound car and note the reactions of the public you are so concerned about. You will see hundreds of people come out on their porches, lawns, sidewalks and street and enjoy the lecture to one who runs out with blood in his eyes and curses on his lips, threatening to break our necks if we don’t move on, not because it is too loud, Mr. Thompson, but because they think their religious susceptibilities have been hurt by comparing their teachings with the Bible. You would even have seen at least one preacher come out into the street almost trembling with rage because the Constitution gives us the same right of free speech that he has. You would have been shocked at the actions and language of a few of our very elite of Rockford and you w-ould easily have discerned the difference between the ‘ ‘ religious bigots” who cannot reason on the Bible and those few who are sincerely bothered by the sound car.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As to your next statement, ‘ ‘ the lecture, several minutes in length, delivered, the truck moves on to the next block,” etc. To be exact, the lecture is 4J minutes in length and not given after 8 p.m. As for the proof that we do not “move on to the next block” you may consult our maps, which show every corner in Rockford where there has been a lecture and which tell you just what that lecture was. This work is done orderly, and we invite you to prove your point from our maps. The lectures are well spaced. No doubt there has been some overlapping at a few locations, but this could seldom bother anyone but a preacher or one of “the principal of the flock”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Your last and most astonishing distortion of fact is as follows : ‘ ‘ Sending a sound truck into the residential areas on a hot summer night when doors and windows are open can only be construed as the method of those who have failed to win an audience through legitimate channels.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And this, Mr. Thompson, when you well know that Judge Eutherford has spoken time and again over the most extensive hookups in the history of radio. No doubt you also know or should know that whenever he speaks in public the largest auditoriums in this country and Europe cannot seat the crowds. Do you call reaching an audience by those methods ‘ ‘ legitimate channels ’ ’ ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And besides this, his writings have surpassed the circulation of 230 million copies, in almost every language on earth. No other author that ever lived has had such a wide circulation of his books, and then you try to make your readers believe he cannot reach the public in legitimate ways. A more untruthful and cowardly statement could scarcely be made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because the Catholic Hierarchy practically controls the Press, and Judge Rutherford’s lectures are given no mention, does not mean that there are no other legitimate channels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All this excitement about our disturbing the peace and quiet of Rockford citizens is nothing but the usual smoke screen laid down by the clergy, especially Catholic, to hide their efforts to stop Judge Rutherford and all the work of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Perhaps you do not know that during the month of August, 1936, the Catholic population of the whole world was called upon by the head of the Hierarchy, through the Catholic press, to say prayers in order to “save us from the infamous Judge Rutherford of the Watch Tower Movement”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Register-Republic</span><span class="font5"> of July 30 shows the clergy are operating true to form, as they do not come out in the open but use a loyal Hierarchy supporter, Attorney Thomas Gill, to denounce the noise of sound cars. With all due respect to Mr. Gill, he is nevertheless a supporter of that foreign power now striving desperately to control the United States. He speaks in our public schools and yet his organization is the avowed enemy of our public school system. Why not hold up Mr. Gill and his organization to ridicule before your readers? You know why.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the motive is to promote peace and quiet for the people, why not mention the sound car of the Gospel Tabernacle of Mrs. Carpenter? Are they not also using “illegitimate channels”? And why the need of false statements and “wisecracks”? It would be very simple to remedy the noise of our sound car, or even pass an ordinance against its use, without all these extra flourishes of the editor’s pen. But they prove, it seems, that <sup>1</sup> ‘ out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh ’ ’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Last September I discussed fully the use of this sound car with Chief Bargen and Mayor Bloom. I received their permission to operate it as it has been operated, and told them of the opposition of the clergy throughout the country. I said that no doubt similar efforts would be made to stop the work here as in other places. That is now being done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Evidently the petition to the Federal Communications Commission and Radio Stations of the United States is the last straw that the slipping Hierarchy can stand. This petition, which is read at each location of the sound car, requests that a public debate be arranged, one side to be taken by a high official of the Roman Catholic Church and the opposite side by Judge Rutherford. Then millions of people can hear whether or not Judge Rutherford misrepresents the teachings of the Catholic Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You should sign this petition at your earliest opportunity if you want to hear something good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In closing I would like to leave for your consideration the advice given by Gamaliel under very similar circumstances:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought: but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found fighting against God. ’—Acts 5: 38, 39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Very truly yours,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Melville</span><span class="font5"> J. </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Eames,</span><span class="font5"> D.C.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>A Little Fun</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">BOY'S essay on editors said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I think the editor is the missing link we read of, and stayed in the bushes after the Flood, and then came out and wrote the thing up, and has been here ever since. If the editor makes mistakes, folks say he ought to be hung; but if the doctor makes mistakes he buries them and people don’t say nothing, because they can’t read and write Latin. When the editor makes mistakes there is a big lawsuit, and swearing and a big fuss, but if the doctor makes one there is a funeral, cut flowers and perfect silence. A doctor can use a word a yard long without him or anyone else knowing what it means, but when the editor uses one he has to spell it. If the doctor goes to see another man’s wife, he charges the man for the visit, but if the editor goes he gets a charge of buckshot. Any college can make doctors to order, but editors have to be born.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The secretary saith:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Who can find a virtuous editor? for his price is above rubles. The heart of his subscribers doth safely trust in him, so that he shall have no need of the censor. He will do them good and not evil, all the days of his life. He seeketh clippings and cartoons and worketh diligently at his typewriter. He is like the merchant’s ships, bringing his material from afar. He riseth also while it is yet night and getteth an idea (yea, two), and writeth a manuscript, giving food for thought to his readers. He considereth also the galleys, and with the fruit of his hands he maketh a dummy. He girdeth</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">his loins with vim and strengtheneth his pointed remarks. He perceiveth that his dummy is good, but he holdeth it back to the dismay of the compositor—sometimes. He layeth his hands to the scissors and stretch-cth them out to the pastepot. He is not afraid of the enemy, and all his subscribers are filled with merriment. Some of his readers rise up and call him names, but he openeth his mouth with fact, hope and courage. Many editors have done well, but thou beatest the Dutch. (So to speak.) [The secretary is Dutch.—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And the editor saith:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Woe betide that man that thinketh himself to be an editor, but his subscribers knoweth it not, who peradventure would produce a new number for the appetite of those who still have the hunger of youth. And he looketh in his kitty, and behold there is naught. In a day that he thinketh not the man from the dispatch desk leereth at him and demandeth the copy that is due unto him. And if the copy cometh not there is war in the camp, and a trembling in the host, and a running to and fro, and a searching for the jawbone left at Lehi, and it is not found. And the editor hath a pain above his neck, or below his neck, or wherever his brain may be, while those round about say the pain is neither above the neck nor below it, but in it. Thereupon he readeth ten thousand times ten thousand clippings, and the kitty is filled, and the subscriber knoweth it in due time.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>Von Ranke’s “History of the Reformation in Germany”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">HIS work (775 pages, E. P. Dutton &amp;&nbsp;Co., New York, 1905) is for the student of history, not the casual reader. Read at the rapid rate of 275 words per minute, it takes 20 hours of solid reading to finish it. Carefully compiled from letters and reports still on file in the official archives of all the principal German cities, it is as obviously fair as is possible to make it. It is overburdened with petty details of men and towns. It might better have been entitled “History of the Great Awakening”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Prior to the middle of the fifteenth century the whole world was sound asleep. The god of this world had completely blinded the minds of all men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Neither by land nor by water were the ways safe; no safe-conduct, whether of the head or the members of the empire, was the least heeded; there was no protection, whether for subjects or for such foreigners as were entitled to it; the husbandman, by whose labor all classes were fed, was ruined; widows and orphans were deserted; not a pilgrim or a messenger or a tradesman could travel along the roads, whether to fulfill his pious duty, or to deliver his message, or to execute his business. To these evils were added the boundless luxury in clothing and food; the wealth of the country all found its way into foreign lands, especially to Rome, where new exactions were daily invented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Though the art of printing was invented in 1423 it took long years of patient effort to make suitable types, presses and other printing paraphernalia, and it was not until 1456 that the first book was printed. It was the Bible, the Word of the Living God, in the Latin tongue. It was not until fifteen years later that the British had their first printed book, an explanation of the game of chess. Columbus landed in San Salvador twenty-one years further on. It was God’s will that men should begin to shake off their sleep. Certain peculiar conditions made Germany the center of the awakening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With the wider spread of the Bible in Latin, and with the discovery that the world is round, and not flat, as the Roman theologians had all along contended, it was inevitable that men would begin to think, and to explore every avenue of human interest. The universities became crowded with thousands of restless, earnest, honest, inquiring minds, and new ones were opened everywhere. Every emperor, and king, and lesser potentate, rightly desired to have a share. Knighthood had just passed out. The business of killing men at a distance, with guns and powder and balls, had just become established.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>The University at Wittenberg</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">It was under circumstances such as these that Frederick, king of Saxony, founded the University of Wittenberg. Without a doubt divine providence led this wise, kind, honest and fearless man to establish the institution in which Luther and Melanchthon were the principal teachers. Without His protection they would have been destroyed long before the League of Smalkald gave their work the shelter it subsequently received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Luther-Melanchthon partnership worked perfectly. Luther was a natural-born politician, a clever pamphleteer, and musician, as well as a good scholar. Throughout his career he believed that the “higher pow’ers” are the civil rulers. He thought the Roman Catholic Church the bride of Christ, and merely sought to cleanse her of her defilements by bringing all Germany back to the Bible, as the proper foundation of the Catholic faith. He had no thought of starting anything new. He was content that all the old forms and ceremonies should go on unchanged, except so far as they were contradictory of plain statements in the Word of God, to which he constantly appealed. He had a great fund of w’hat is called “common sense”, and the ability to put things in such a way that any German who could read and w’rite could understand what he had to say. He was the first in all the world to make great use of the art of printing to get the Word of God into the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The increase in the number of German publications which followed Luther’s appearance before the public was prodigious. In the year 1518 we find 71 enumerated ; in 1519, 111; in 1520, 208 ; in 1521, 211; in 1522, 347; in 1523, 498. If we inquire whence this wonderful increase emanated we shall find it was from Wittenberg, and the chief author, Luther himself. In the year 1518 we find 20 books published with his name; in 1519, 50; in 1520, 133; in 1521, when he was interrupted by his journey to Worms, and hindered by a forced seclusion, about 40; in 1522, again 130; and 1523, 183. In no nation or age has a more autocratic and powerful writer appeared, and it would be difficult to find any other who has united so perfectly popular and intelligible a style, and such downright, homely good sense, to so much originality, power and genius.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>Melanchthoris Close Contact with Luther</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">As </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> scholar Melanchthon was superior to Luther, but was content to let the latter be the spokesman, and it was better so. They both worked together for the one end, of establishing the right to preach and teach the Word of God as then due to be understood. When all Germany came rapidly under Luther's influence, and rulers, priests and people in many and important cities and districts were accepting the new teachings almost </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">en masse,</span><span class="font7"> Melanchthon prepared instructions for the priests, approved by Luther, in effect thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The preachers were admonished not to use reproachful language concerning the pope or the bishops, but to keep solely in view the wants of the many, the implanting of the evangelical doctrine in the minds of the common people. The greatest respect for all that was traditional and established was shown. It was not thought necessary positively to forbid the use of Latin for the mass; the administration of the sacrament in one kind was even deemed allowable, where any one from scruples of conscience was unwilling entirely to throw off the ancient ritual; though the compulsion to auricular confession was rejected as unauthorized by the Holy Scriptures, it was declared salutary for everyone to confess the sins by which he felt his conscience burdened, and about which he needed counsel; nor were even all the festivals of the saints abolished: it was enough if they were not invoked nor their intercession prayed for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The teachings spread like wildfire. In the year 1523, out of a total of 498 books published in Germany 183 were from the pen of Luther (with Melanchthon co-operating) and 215 were from other pens in favor of the new opinions; total 398, or almost exactly four-fifths of all the books of the year. Of the remaining 100 books only 20 were Catholic books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This growth is all the more remarkable when it is reflected that all this time Luther was under sentence of death by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. At Leipzig, only about 50 miles distant from Wittenberg, two citizens were beheaded for no other reason than that some Lutheran books were found in their possession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Where the Hierarchy had local rulers under their control they showed that “sweet spirit” which has always animated them and does to this day:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We read of preachers being nailed to the pillory by the tongue, so that in order to get free they were forced to tear themselves away, and were thus mutilated for life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One executioner was so moved by the beauty and innocence of a sweet girl of 16 that before throwing her body into the flames he mercifully drowned her in a horse trough. The whole German people at heart hated the devilish outfit headquartered at what is now Vatican City, but were caught like rats in a trap and did not know what to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Why the People Hated the Hierarchy</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It would require volumes to tell all the reasons why the German people hated the Roman Hierarchy at the time Luther and Melanchthon were flooding the country with their pamphlets. Some of the reasons have already been mentioned. At this very time Cardinal Diego Deza and other inquisitors-general were burning thousands of persons alive in Spain and elsewhere, all because they were even suspected of doubting that the Church of the Devil is the bride of Christ. Forty-five of these inquisitor-generals burned alive 35,534 men and women, according to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Banner.</span><span class="font7"> The German people knew a great deal about this, even though much of it was done in Spain and Italy; for it was done, here and there, wherever the Hierarchy had a tool in power that would do their unholy will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The “worship’' had become a disgrace to common decency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The most extravagant expressions were uttered in praise of the Virgin: “The eternal Daughter of the eternal Father, the heart of the invisible Trinity ’ ’; it was said, “Glory be to the Virgin, to the Father, and to the Son. ’ ’ <a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark68">1</a></sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The popes were so crooked they could not lie straight in bed. Von Ranke found in the archives a receipt for 100,000 livres ($20,000) contributed by the poor people of France to wage war against the Turks, which the pope had turned over to his nephew to spend as he saw fit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The cardinals were so crooked and ferocious that Cardinal Alfonso Petrucci several times had a dagger concealed beneath his purple robe with which he intended to murder the pope, but concluded to resort to poisoning instead, and thus was betrayed by others taken into the plot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the territory of Salzburg, Bavaria, away down on the southern edge of Germany, a priest who had accepted Luther’s doctrines was on the way to Mittersill, where he was to be imprisoned for life. Two boys set him free while his captors were carousing, and for this the archbishop had them beheaded privately, without trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bishops obtained their jobs as political favors. Thus, at Schwerin, in the year 1516, Prince Magnus of Mecklenburg, although not yet seven years of age, was chosen as a bishop. In desperation over conditions in the church even the pope, Adrian VI, had to admit that,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some years ago, many abominations took place in this chair; everything was turned to evil, and the corruption spread from the head to the members, from the pope to the prelates.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>Zwingli the Uncompromising</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">While Luther and Melanchthon were in jeopardy of their lives in Germany a man who was equally brave and was absolutely uncompromising was teaching in Switzerland what he believed to be the truth. Zwingli was an honest priest, bold, dogmatic, unafraid. Though there was every reason, apparently, why his followers should have joined with the Lutherans for their mutual protection, all attempts to bring about such an arrangement fell through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Zwingli rejected the institution of bishops, had the statues and altars removed from the churches and the paintings washed over with stone color. Organs were silenced. If he could find nothing in the Bible to support a doctrine or a practice he would have nothing to do with such a doctrine or practice. He accused Luther of ‘sighing after the fleshpots of Egypt’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">His bold course almost made him a revolutionist and he died in battle at the head of his followers. The Roman Catholic forest cantons made a sudden rush upon the cantons of the north of Switzerland in which his teachings had made great headway, and overwhelmed those who had agreed “henceforward to preach undaunted the Holy Scriptures, pure and unmixed with men’s fables”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Luther and his followers would have shared the fate of Zwingli but for one thing. All arrangements had been made to blot them out, or to attempt it, when the Turks came storming at the gates of Vienna. In order to resist the Turks it was absolutely necessary for the emperor, Charles V (king of Spain by heredity, emperor of Germany by election, ruler of Austria, the Netherlands and Naples, and therefore the most important ruler of his time) to enter into negotiation with the Protestants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What would be the consequences of their rejection (of his overtures) was soon seen when the emperor prepared to bring his own army into the field. He was particularly in want of firearms and of powder, and he was obliged to apply to the cities of Strasburg, Augsburg, Ulm, Nuremberg, Constance and Frankfort to come to his aid with theirs. They were all Protestant.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>The League of Smalkald</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">All of foregoing, and hundreds of other coordinated matters that may not even be touched on within the limits of this review, led the surviving Protestants (after the overthrow of Zwingli in Switzerland) to enter into the League of Smalkald for their mutual defense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the 22d of December, 1530, about a dozen brave men met in the snow-covered town of Smalkald to consider methods by which, if the aims of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy were carried out against any one of the cities or states they represented, the whole body should come to its aid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After nine days of discussion the League was finally entered into, on December 31,1530. It was in this document that Protestantism, or freedom of speech, made its stand separate and apart from Roman Catholicism, which stand it has been able to maintain, more or less haltingly, from that time to this. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, however, has not at any time abandoned its claim of the right to put anybody to death, in any manner, if by that means it can make any part of the world subservient to its will. Ranke's statement of the formation of the League of Smalkald is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A draft of an agreement was immediately drawn up, in which the emperor’s name was, indeed, carefully avoided, and the causes of alarm obscurely alluded to, in such expressions as this, “It appears as if there existed an intention of crushing the followers of the pure Word of God,” but it was more explicit in what related to measures of defence. The allies bound themselves to hasten to the aid of any one among them who might be attacked on account of the Word of God. It was further declared that this League was directed neither against the Emperor, nor against any individual whatsoever; which only meant that it would attack no one, and would rigorously confine itself to self-defense. The League included Saxony, Hessen, Luneburg, Wolfgang of Anhalt, the two Counts of Mansfield, the cities of Magdeburg and Bremen. The other assembled princes and States promised to declare themselves within a short time. On the 31st of December they dispersed. These nine days may be reckoned among the most important in the history of the world. The threatened and despised minority, under the influence of a religious idea on which depended the future development of the human mind, assumed an energetic and even warlike attitude. The religious dispute was transferred into one of law.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A five-minute talk</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font7">F THE people understood that Jehovah God has a flag or banner that symbolically represents truth and absolute righteousness, then it appears that all of good will toward Jehovah would desire to recognize and give allegiance to that banner. Long ago God announced His purpose to establish a government of righteousness by and through which all the families of the earth may receive His blessing. He first sent Jesus to the earth to redeem the human race. His promise is that Jesus Christ should later set up a government of righteousness. Concerning Jesus and that government it is written: “The government shall be upon his shoulder; and ... of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end.” (Isa. 9:6,7) For centuries the people of good will have looked forward to the coming of the Lord and His kingdom, and believing God's Word they have devoted themselves to Him and His kingdom. They have prayed as Jesus taught them: ‘Thy kingdom come; thy will be done, on earth as in heaven.’ They have taught their children to believe on and serve God, knowing that such is the only right course. They fear to displease God, and are anxious to do what He has commanded them. They well know that God has provided everlasting blessings only to those who do obey and serve Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Has God provided for such people of good will </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> flag or banner&quot;? The Scriptures answer, at Psalm 60:4,5: “Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth . . . that thy beloved may be delivered.” Those who follow another banner contrary to that of Jehovah God are certain not to receive the blessing of the Lord, because He declares that the kingdom under Christ is the only hope of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Psalm 33 it is written: “Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah.” The various nations of earth have made and lifted up their own banners or flags, all different, and all of which ignore God and His kingdom as the hope of the human race, and for that reason the nations cannot receive the blessings of Jehovah. In the schools the Bible, which is the Word of God, is ignored and evolution and other theories of men are substituted therefor. No nation on the earth has been able to bring peace and prosperity and full happiness to the people. These facts must be conceded by all reasonable persons. It is time to give heed to God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have now come to the time of crisis because the end of Satan’s world, including the governments of this world, is here and the time of the kingdom of God is at hand. It is the will of God that the people should hear the truth of and concerning His kingdom. Therefore </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font7">gives commandment to all who worship and serve Him, saying (Isaiah 62:10): “Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; east up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font7">obedience to this commandment Jehovah’s witnesses go through the land lifting up God’s standard or flag to the people that the way may be prepared for them and that they may see their privilege of serving God and His kingdom. That banner or flag is the message of truth concerning God and His kingdom. In obedience to this commandment Jehovah’s witnesses go ‘through the gate’ or way to the kingdom of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font7">and point the people thereto that they may see that such is the way of peace, prosperity, and everlasting life. The people must choose whether they will worship and serve an image of imperfection and unrighteousness and die, or whether they will worship and obey God and live. Satan and his agents try to prevent the people from receiving the message of truth and at the same time to compel them to ignore and disobey God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The people must now decide for themselves whether they will hail some man-made institution as their means of salvation or whether they will look to God and His kingdom under Christ for salvation. All who love God and Christ, and desire to see a righteous government, will joyfully trust in and obey the Lord and follow His banner of truth. Be diligent to study the Bible and its accompanying helps, that you may know the truth and walk in the right way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is because Jehovah’s witnesses carry to the people the message of truth that they are perse-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">cuted. Who could be against that message of truth and against God’s kingdom except the Devil and his agents? You who are of good will and desire righteousness, how will you be able to determine what to do ? The correct answer is found in the Scriptures; and you should arm yourselves with the Bible helps that Jehovah’s witnesses bring to you, and learn God’s way.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Some Thoughts on the Choco </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Kathe B. Palm (South American pioneer)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">H</span><span class="font7">AVE you ever taken a bath under a spring, coming down the east shore of the Bio Condole? All around you is the most charming tropical scenery in the break of the day. No <sup>&lt;£</sup>bogas” (Negroes that push or row the canoes along the river) are yet at work; and the remainder of the people are still sound asleep in their most primitive huts built on poles and made of bamboo and dry banana and palm leaves, with nothing in but a place to cook oh with charcoal and with some handmade mats to sleep on. Only a few have a chair or two made of cowhide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But now I am about to get that Christian shower bath with Lifebuoy soap. One had a pretty restless night; too many mosquitoes pestering the life out of you, because there are no screens, neither a net to sleep under, and that jar of Vix stayed behind in Buenaventura, no lemon handy. So you hear the first tiny singers with colors that make your heart glad, and get you to marvel at the fine taste of their maker, and no less at his skill, of course. The Bujio is one you hear calling his own name, but he is gray and hides well. This one must be across the river, as you can enjoy a fine echo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As you are at it with the clear water and soap, standing in the gravel, you hear a dog above you. Now what? Will someone peep down from the hut up there? Not likely. It is too early, and the big banana leaves keep them from seeing you, anyway. But alas! That old dog woke up the roosters in the trees. Of course you know what those young fries are like; and so this one had to shout it across the river and wake the others. I should worry. I am through. It was a treat and a dandy gift from Above; so I accepted it humbly, and hurry in, to get that morning rub and to get ready for service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After some time the Boga calls for you, and you use that bookcase as a seat for a few minutes, as it is a trick that needs to be practiced, to stand up in these champas and canoes. They are all handcut out of trees; and it is a treat to see those well-built naked bodies at work, because a hanky on a string around the hips is all they wear. They use the palanca and the canalettes to row and push and pull, and often have the big canoes heavily loaded with cargo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You see, the Choco is that small strip of land and river and swamps along the west coast of Colombia, about thirty-five to forty miles north of Buenaventura, where the San Juan Rio flows into the Pacific, up to Panama. Rio Atrato and Rio San Juan almost meet, as one goes from north to south, and the other south to north; and there is a road for mule traffic connecting up. The Choco is Colombia’s source of gold and platinum dust; and how! They find it mostly in the rios, and the biggest company (English-American) uses many dredges day and night with excellent success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But it is hard on white men, as the climate is tough; malaria, typhoid, paludism, and horrible sicknesses on the feet and the legs. All native children run around with enormous bellies— worms. What a misery! It is not of much use to try to put it into words. As one visits with the Kingdom message, one sees their truth-hungry faces shining when they hear Judge Rutherford's voice on “Purgatory” and “Armageddon”. One old Negro told me he had w’aited three days for me to come to that group of huts with my records. So he </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">was</span><span class="font7"> pleased to see me finally coming with Jehovah’s message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He went to call the others together. As we walked along he hollered up to the huts: “Hallelujah! Come all down. The Kingdom message is here now.” It sounded marvelous in that quiet tropical land. Those Negroes have a tune as they call to each other. Their Spanish is very soft and most musical in the Choco. So my heart leaped with joy and thankfulness to the King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They came and heard it all; and I told them not to thank me, but to send all their thanks up to where the message came from. You see, those Negroes cannot read; so they did appreciate the information by records so much more. The fine thing was that in the two nearest villages were only four clergymen, living in one, and visiting the other one once in a great while; and while I tried to do the work as quickly as possible, they did not seem to wake up; so I did not notice any dirty influence yet. Also, to my surprise, I found comparatively few crosses, holy pictures with candles and flowers, etc., around Choco; and fewer people wore those little “blessed” (?) medals around their necks; and certainly quite a few answered “No!” to my question if they believed in hell-fire. Yet an intelligent young Palestine Jew, a merchant, told me that they all pay when the longskirts come around for collections, as they would be boycotted if they would refuse. Wonder why they don’t do as “Lulu” of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Evening Post,</span><span class="font7"> who puts an IOU ticket on the collection plate in church? Jewish tradespeople are generally quite smart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I had a surprise when I worked the main camp of the C.M.C.P. (Co. Minera Choco Pacifico). Since I arrived between “Christmas” and New Year, everybody in the Negro camp, and also those very few in the white camp who wanted some of the books, told me to please wait for payday. So since I could well keep busy, I did, and had about forty Negroes and Colombian people's names collected and which book they wanted; and I hoped that they meant it, as they had all eagerly heard and enjoyed the records. But imagine my surprise, as </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">not one </span><span class="font7">man or woman pays on or after payday! All had simply changed their minds! So I didn’t place anything. But one Swedish old seabear was especially glad to have some Swedish books, and a few others took some English. But for that one old Swedish chief engineer it was worth while to make that expensive trip to the Choco, and also to catch some malaria; for as I came back to Buenaventura it threw me down for the first time in my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then there is one more pleasant little thing to be mentioned. There are four children amongst the white couples. I had them together on a Sunday morning for a party. We played in the sandbox for half an hour. Then B. had to leave us, as her dad had been somewhat offended that I dared invite his little B. to put that “junk”, as he called it, into her head. Little B. did not want to go with her dad; but the old Devil got Dad to do his will. Of the other three, one was too small, and so I took my pretty little A. and M.L. and told them what I knew about that five-year-old Kingdom girl in San Diego who asked her mother one day: “Mother, when God kills the Devil, will little children be spanked any more?” “Oh, no, Bonnie; most certainly not.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“O </span><span class="font7">Mother, I wish God would kill the Devil tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Did they like it? Of course. Those little eyes were shining, and they were just hanging on my lips for more. So we had some about Isaiah 11:6-8; and they had at once something to tell about those enormous, powerful and deadly snakes existing in the Choco. They all agreed that one who does not love God is a bad person. So I bet B.’s father a cooky that little B. is going to get the witness later on, out of her friend's mouth, and that may do better work yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And now only a few words about the gold and platinum work of the Choco. The C.M.C.P. is at it since 1900; that is, it has changed hands and names since, but gold and platinum have been found in the Choco since then by whites. Now they have more and smaller companies besides the C.M.C.P. there; and also, of course, peons (working people) are washing gold in the rios with their batejas (a flat hand-carved wooden bowl) constantly, and with success. The C.M.C.P. finds gold and platinum, about 1200 ounces of each, every week, with their four big dredges at work day and night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They do not know the source of it, as gold is generally found in granite, and there is none around, neither the, through times and elements, decayed granite, some kind of sandstone. And needless to say, after the Colombian Government gets its percentage, the precious metals </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font7"> to New York city by Grace liners from Buenaventura for? Ammunition and war purposes?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But around the camp all is quiet and feels safe. Old, old, flatfooted Joe, the night watchman (colored), carries a rifle; but has he shells in it? And can Fritz, the old Colombian watchdog, really bite or scare someone badly? They </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">don’t </span><span class="font7">have to. Crime is almost unknown; in many years, they tell me of two cases only. But </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">lot of petty thievery is going on amongst those darkies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The country produces maize, juka, bananas, lemons, pineapples, sugar cane; and all go by canoe to the market—also their intoxicating drink made of sugar cane, called guarapo. All darky women here smoke cigars and pipes; and everybody spits, in spite of all the signs the Company puts out forbidding it. No police, and no one carries arms except the night watchman. A civil-clad policeman is there for the Government’s sake. The climate of the Choco is very damp and hot. Rain pours down in bucketfuls daily. The colored people have that woolly, woolly hair; and you see them carrying metals and toothpicks in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Condolo I met the banker, a charming, intelligent young chap. He ordered the three </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font7"> books. He is from Antioquia. The people from that State are very thrifty. But also is the Jesuit influence there the strongest. Mr. Lopez (the banker), however, is against his country’s being in their hands, and tells me that when an Antioquian is dying, on being asked if he would like to have a clergyman come to his bed he will answer: “No. Call two. I would like to die between two thieves.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I could tell you more about the Choco, but I will stop here, and find out first whether this is fit to be printed at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Chilean Chili con Carne</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font7">T IS not a bad scolding, just a little one, in fact, from Kathe B. Palm, a Chilean pioneer:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Being en route to a new piece of territory in beautiful Chile, and having a copy of No. 445 at hand, I cannot resist the urgent desire to drop you a line of information about how it feels to read </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age. </span><span class="font6">For a good many years now I have not failed to read each number, when possible in two languages, but, sir, I have had to change my style. I used not to let anything keep me from reading it all at once. But now, with all those pictures, and all, I cannot do it any more. I have to take it almost as carefully as that other journal, our precious </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font6"> that you consider your own most necessary food. You see, sir, it is because </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> is packed so full of extremes. How can one laugh with a bleeding heart? When I saw those drawings I had to laugh out loud; and then, sir, when I read of the persecutions of Jehovah’s people, in Germany, in the same issue, I found myself weeping ; and it is extremely difficult for me to show tears in public. But, sir, I am willing that my heart shall bleed to the last drop if only Jehovah will provide the opportunity and give the needed strength. Anjwvay, I wish His smiles forever, sir, upon </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font6">for what it brings to a happy-go-lucky Kingdom girl down in South America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Deputy Mayor of Vienna Canned</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">HE deputy mayor of Vienna, Dr. Ernst Karl, has been fired, or canned, or given the air, whichever expression seems most poetic. He wrote a book (‘Oh that mine adversary had written a book!’—Job 31:35) in which he stated that the main trouble with Austria is the “modern Jesuitical diplomacy of the Vatican”. Dr. Karl is a Catholic and an honest man—too honest for the job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Inside Europe</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 219&quot;)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Gunther says of Dollfuss’ form of Fascism: </span><span class="font6">lie borrowed the idea from a papal encyclical, the Quadragesimo Anno of 1931, wherein Pope Pius XI pleaded for the end of social strife and urged the adoption of a corporate organization of society as  a <span class="font6">“cure" for class war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This is the very thing claimed for Coughlin’s radio preachments, and the thing that was claimed for Roosevelt's NBA and other alphabetical denouements. A little more about the Austrian tragedy:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Socialism lost out in Austria because of its own decency. The socialists hated bloodshed and violence; they could not believe that their enemies were capable of ruthlessness and treachery; innocently they believed the lies of their opponents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The socialists seventeen different times offered to disarm the Schutzbund (Vienna city militia) if the government would disarm the Heimwehr (Catholic peasant troops).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are interesting chapters in the book on the Turkish and Russian dictatorships, for there are instruments of Gog in areas once given over to Greek Catholicism and Mohammedanism as there are similar instruments in Roman Catholic countries. The whole world is moving dictatorshipward, and human liberty is perishing in every corner of the earth before the new monster, the totalitarian state, the Devil’s final masterpiece in misgovernment.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Recently I attended the monster meeting of 7,000 people at the Alexandra Palace where Judge Rutherford exposed the designs of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and in this connection thought the following incident might be of interest to you. I was chatting with Mr. X, a very prominent businessman in------</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">and a Roman Catholic well acquainted with leading Jesuits. From one of these he said that he had heard that “within six months Germany would seize Czechoslovakia, and that there would be a revolution in France during the same period ’ ’.

<h2><a name="bookmark86"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark87"></a>American Flag Not a Fetish</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font7">CCORDING to the Whirligig, children in school are being made to salute a flag. This is a fine way to make them grow up hating that flag. Most of us now hate poetry, Shakespeare, speeches, large words or anything else of which we had an overdose in school. If the Legionnaires are behind this flag-saluting in schools, they are getting fatheaded in their old age.— Linus L. Pratt, in San Francisco </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Weres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font7"> happen to have a genuine love of the Stars and Stripes; I never come into New York Harbor and see it without having my throat swell with pride as it waves in the breeze, and I never see it anywhere unexpectedly without feeling the same rush of affectionate emotion—exactly the same feeling I have for my wife and family after even a brief separation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But as an American there is nothing in the world that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font7"> would resent more than having to get up in public and recite an oath declaring my love for my wife and family. As for having to give frequent public and formal gestures of respect and affection to them under force of law, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font7">have no doubt that I should have to desert them eventually in hatred if they forced me to such a performance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Affection and respect are not things that can be created to order. Any crook and liar can go through the forms and will do so without turning a hair.—Citizen in Washington </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Post.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How would it be to have a law requiring every child to kiss his mother good morning and good night, under penalty of a fine of five dollars to be levied upon every parent failing for three successive days to exact the lawful salutation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ridiculous? Not more so than the attempt to stimulate love of country by compulsory salute of the flag under penalty of expulsion from school for non-saluting children and fines for parents and teachers who do not co-operate to make the legal requirement effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Nothing could go so far toward convincing sensible people that flag-saluting </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font7"> a cult and that the flag </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font7"> being treated like an idol as the passage and enforcement of such laws for compulsory saluting. Can it be true, after all, that there is a new religion of nationalism, and that the flag is its sacred symbol and the “pledge of allegiance” is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Quicunque vult?—The Christian Century.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Traveler</span><span class="font6"> stands up and is counted as for the repeal of the law. Let us warn you before you, too, stand up and are counted, that you run the risk of being dubbed red, radical and rebellious. Professional patriots, who get public office or sell newspapers by flag-waving, call everybody red who does not exhibit the externals of loyalty. However rotten a group is at the core, so long as it waves flags and calls opponents dirty reds, they, the patrioteers, anoint themselves and damn everybody else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Recently the General Court of Massachusetts through legislative enactment erased a sin of 300 years ago when Roger Williams was banished from its boundaries. A good man is at last exonerated publicly, but is it common knowledge that one of the points in Roger Williams’ faith was his unwillingness to swear to an oath, believing, as he did, that such was an act of worship? And now while a Christian of three centuries ago is being vindicated God-fearing children are sent to a reform school for holding beliefs similar in some respects.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Symbolically, at least, the United States Navy puts church ahead of patriotic emblems. When services are held aboard ship, the church pennant flies above the national colors on the same halyard. It is the only flag ever displayed thus. The Navy ought to be as reliable as the magistrate in question (or, for that matter, all magistrates put together) on matters of patriotism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is probably fortunate for the Navy, though, that Boston Navy yard is a Federal reservation. If it weren’t, a Boston policeman might come along some Sabbath morning and throw a few captains into reform school for putting God above flag. In fairness to the magistrate, however, one other thing involving precedent should be cited. There is no precedent in this country or any other for granting small minorities their constitutional rights.—Minoritus, in Detroit </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Free Press.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">be required to kiss his wife every night and morning, but should be compelled, at least once each week, regardless of past faithfulness, to recite the sacred oath he took on his wedding day to “forsake all others and keep her only”. Such compulsion would bring many a triangular gentleman to his senses and it would also put to rout the army of feminine home-wreckers. Triangular love affairs would cease.—H. M. R., in Duluth </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Herald.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">John B. Quinn, of St. Louis, president of the National League for Compulsory Education, in an address at Montreal said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Too often children forced to leave school under sixteen years of age without sufficient preparation for life’s duties become liabilities in the form of idlers, wasters, or criminals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And that being the case, one wonders at the lack of patriotism of the compulsory flag saluters in expelling the children of Jehovah’s witnesses from school in various parts of the country, so that they may not have the preparation for life’s duties which they need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span><span class="font7"> said of the flag-salute nonsense:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It rests upon the naively medieval notion that patriotism is something to be maintained by spells, charms and incantations: that the devils of subversion are to be exorcised by waving flags at them, and that Americanism is a claptrap ritual rather than a thing of inner faith, understanding and devotion.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The current epidemic of excitement about flag saluting strikes me as a symptom of a growing fanaticism of the sort which permits Hitlers and Mussolinis to seize power. Dictators always play on highly aroused nationalistic waves to flimflam the nations they rule.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The present custom of compelling school children to salute the flag under penalty of severe punishment calls to mind an old story of an emperor who wished to compel all foreign ambassadors who came before him to make an obeisance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When they refused, he hit on the device of having the door made so low that they would be forced to bow down to get through. One ambassador simply turned around and backed into the emperor’s presence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The others did not follow his example, because they were unwilling to risk what might happen, but they consoled themselves by thinking that no one (save the despot in his folly) would attach any importance to an obeisance which was forced from them.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark88"></a>Inside Europe</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">INSIDE EUROPE,</span><span class="font7"> by John Gunther, European correspondent of the Chicago </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span><span class="font7"> (published by Hamish Hamilton, 90 Great Russell Street, London: 12s 6d net) compresses into 500 pages all the essentials in the lives of some 675 men and women that had most to do with making the history of Europe in the past twenty-five years, and are expected to have much to do with the years that are just at hand. The pope is barely mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The book is an up-to-the-minute Who’s Who of all Europe, especially its dictators, describes every important event of Europe’s recent history from the inside, tries to be fair, tells many things never before told, and does not indulge in idle prophecy. Read as a whole, it gives a good idea of Europe as a whole. Kept thereafter as a work of reference, it enables one to read current news more intelligently. Some special points are noted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What he thinks of Hitler, idol of millions of the German people, may be gleaned from this pithy statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hitler promised the authorities of Bavaria not to make a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Putsch;</span><span class="font6"> and promptly made one. He promised to tolerate the Papen government; then fought it. He promised not to change the composition of the first cabinet; then changed it. He promised to kill himself if the Munich coup failed; it failed, and he is still alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He gave jobs, big jobs, to confessed and admitted terrorists and murderers, like Heines. When a communist was murdered at Potempa, in Silesia, in circumstances of peculiarly revolting brutality, Hitler announced publicly his spiritual unity with the murderers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The two specific charges that the Lord Jesus Christ made against the god of this world, the Devil, are that he is a liar and a murderer. (John 8: 44) Manifestly, Hitler is like his father the Devil, and those that &quot;Heil Hitler” are really hailing the Devil as their lord and savior, and looking to him for their deliverance and their reward.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark89"></a>Germany’s New Religion</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Gunther observes that “in older days new leaders were usually the founders of new religions. Now they are political.” At the bottom of the page (35) in Judge Rutherford’s familiar handwriting (the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">GA</span><span class="font7"> obtained the book as a loan from him) occur the words, “All religions have become political and commercial.” How very true! Religions, and that includes the new German “Heil Hitler” religion, have become and are mere excuses for placing certain persons in control of their fellow men and keeping them there. None of such men are even remotely interested in removing the reproaches from the name of Him in whom they live and move and have their being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Viewed with the sharp eyes of a newspaper correspondent that has the run of all Europe, the new gods that call forth the worship of the German and Italian people are merely hard-boiled executives that remorselessly act on such suggestions from their subordinates as appeal to their selfishness:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Industry” in a dictator or head of a state means, as a rule, ability to read and listen. The major part of the work of Hitler or Mussolini is perusal of reports and attention to the advice of experts and subordinates. Half their working time they spend in receiving information. Therefore it is necessary for a dictator (a) to choose men intelligently—many of Hitler’s best men he inherited from the old civil service, (b) to instill faith in himself in them. Hitler has succeeded in this double task amply. And when his men fail him, he murders them.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark90"></a>The Reichstag Fire</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Without here quoting from Gunther, but drawing the plainly intended conclusions he expected the reader to arrive at, the Reichstag fire, which destroyed the German republic, was a cleverly designed and executed piece of work of Hitler’s’SA (brown shirt) gangsters, so timed as to throw the blame on a demented pyromaniac, Van der Lubbe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is known that Van der Lubbe was a halfwit, a pyromaniac, that he had boasted of setting several fires in Berlin and had threatened to burn the Reichstag. The Nazis heard of it. They had a tunnel from Nazi headquarters to the Reichstag building. Through that tunnel large quantities of petrol, phosphorus and sulphur were carried and placed all over the central part of the building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the same moment that Van der Lubbe lit his little pile of tablecloths and curtains at one end of the room, the SA Karl Ernst lit the petrol at the tunnel end. In two minutes and five seconds the whole building was in flames. Van der Lubbe was decapitated. Dead men tell no tales.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But before dead men become dead men they sometimes write letters which boast of their misdeeds and tell of their fears. Suspecting that he was marked for death Ernst wrote a letter,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">dated June 3, 1934, and sent it abroad with instructions that it be published if his fears became true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This Ernst letter purports to be a full description of the Reichstag fire plot. It gives a brilliant and terrible picture of the attitude and manners of the Nazi leaders just before the fire and after. They were (except for Hitler, who is mentioned reverently only as “He”) vulgar, lusty, cruel, courageous, and having a marvellous time. They sound like a group of Capones in politics for the fun of it. And the fire was plotted almost like a bit of deviltry. Ernst says that he lit the actual fire. His comrades were two SA men, Fiedler and von Mohrenschild. All three were executed in the clean-up of June 30.<a name="footnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark91">2</a></sup> Dead tongues tell no tales.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">All Germany Worships a Murderer</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Having measurably cleared his skirts by putting to death the gang of ruffians, the SA brown shirts’ leaders, that put him in power, Hitler’s next move was to compel the regular army, the Reichswehr, to swear personal allegiance to himself as Germany’s new god. Hindenburg, at 85 years of age, died a mental wreck. The morning of his death every soldier in Germany was compelled to take the following oath of personal loyalty to a man that all history must record as one of the worst liars, cowards, murderers and torturers of the innocent that have ever lived:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I swear by God this sacred oath, that I will render unconditional obedience to the leader of the German reich and people, Adolph Hitler, the Commander-in-Chief of the Wehrmacht (armed forces) and that I will, as a valiant soldier, at all times be ready to stake my life for this oath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Goering, vainest of men, unscrupulous, fearless, capable, in full control of the German air force, wherewith Hitler aims to dominate the earth, and himself one of the outstanding aces of the World War, having personally shot down 23 planes, is by many believed to be the logical successor of Hitler. Meantime, he is the man directly responsible </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">for the</span><span class="font7"> ruthless persecution of Jehovah's people in the unhappy country that, as a whole, loves to boss and to be bossed by the meanest vermin that crawl upon the planet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since Goering came to symbolize the police power of the Third Reich, 12,863 people have been sterilized, some of them forcibly. Some 90,000 Jews have fled the country. In the year between June 1933 and June 1934, 212 men and women were beheaded out of 214 sentenced to death, the great majority for political offenses which in no other country would entail the capital penalty. The number of persons sentenced to imprisonment was 280,308; they were to serve an aggregate of 129,421 years. In addition, 184 persons were shot ‘while attempting to escape’, 13,000 were deprived of citizenship, and 49,000 sent to concentration camps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Justice in Germany is guided by the interests of the state; so it is in Russia. The state is totalitarian in the U.S.S.R.; the German police have similar ambitions. Soviet Russia has a secret police; it has concentration camps; it has only one political party, and all ideological opposition is ruthlessly snuffed out— the same considerations were all copied by the Nazis.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark92"></a>The Little Hitlers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The little Hitlers, as described by Gunther, are not much more attractive than the big one himself or his satellite, Goering, the general manager of the dirty work of the Third Reich. Take for example Julius Streicher, the famous Jew-hater, and beloved by Hitler because he is one. He is described as</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A man of fifty-one, barrel-chested, shaven-headed, in appearance the incarnation of brutality. According to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Heil,</span><span class="font6"> in July 1933 he ordered two hundred and fifty Jews who had been arrested to pluek grass out of a field with their teeth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another is Darre, a man who caused a monument to be erected to Mr. Darre at Wiesbaden and himself made a speech at its dedication. Of such material is the ruling class, The higher powers’ of the New Germany, composed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Darre is the author of the celebrated scheme to divide all the women of the Reich into eugenic classes, like cattle, for breeding purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But General Goering remains the big toad in the Nazi puddle, aside from the Big Toad himself. Mr. Goering has 3,000 war planes ready for instant use and personally knows how to handle them himself to poison and kill men by the million—and has the ability and experience to train other men, and has them already trained, to hop into their seats and do Der Fuehrer’s will in Spain or France or Russia, or elsewhere in Europe, according as Gog, the prime minister of the Devil, may direct, and Jehovah God may allow. What an astounding drama it all is!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark93"></a>The International Murderers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The outstanding feature of modern French history is the venality of the Paris press, its control by the munition makers, earth’s professionalpatriots. Scratch a loud-mouthed, wealthy patriot who owns a newspaper, and you find a munition maker. In America the Hearst rags are always boosting the munition business and demanding that everybody wave the stars and stripes. If they give God the first place, then they are not true Hearst Americans. Gunther says caustically of the French Comite des Forges and its Franco-German Schneider and De Wendel brats:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If I am killed in the next war I hope they will put on my white cross a notation that the bullet which killed me cost a fraction of a cent to make, and sold for three cents or more. Someone, I should like it known, made a nice profit on my mouldering bones. Bullets do not cost much. But if you shoot one million rounds an hour at £6 per thousand the figures mount up. A rifle does not cost much—perhaps £5. But equip an army of one million men, and you have spent £5,000,000. A machine gun costs about £128. The French have about forty thousand of them. A 37-mm. field-gun costs about £200, and each shell about £3. The famous French 75’s come to about £1,600 each. They are expensive and intricate, with fuses built like watches. Their shells cost £5 each, and in a single bombardment some millions may be fired. A big tank complete costs about £16,000. A bombing plane may nick your budget £20,000. A modern cruiser costs £2,200,000, an aircraft carrier £3,800,000, and a big battleship almost £6,000,000. Thus war, as we have good reason to know, is expensive. It costs us money. We pay taxes. But war also makes money—for some— a lot of money. Thus the munitions business, one of the strangest in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The world, according to the League of Nations, spent £855,360,000 on armament last year. In one year, mind you. This sum is too astronomical for ready comprehension. Suppose I had that much money and spent it at the rate of £2 per day. I should still have some left after more than a million years. Suppose it should be transformed into a piece of tape, mile for dollar; it would go around the world 172,169 times. Suppose I had it in gold pieces of £2 each, and counted them at the rate of one per second; the job would take 1,356 years 5 days 8 hours.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark94"></a>The Jesuit Warrior of France</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Though Mr. Gunther makes no prophecies, he sees Fascism coming in France, as in all Europe, and though, probably for the sake of his book, he avoids elsewhere directly connecting Fascism with Jesuitism, he does link the two in France, and seems to think Weygand, the Jesuit warrior, the most likely tool with which the pope will strike France when the Spanish Republic is no more. After quoting Clemenceau as saying of General Weygand that “he’s up to his neck in priests”, Gunther, under the subtitle of “The Jesuit Warrior”, says of him, in part, “Weygand’s Catholicism—he is a fanatic Catholic— naturally made him suspect to the Left . . . Weygand is, naturally, the old white hope of the Right, and the terrier-darling of the Fascist Leagues.'”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of the enlightened and capable president of the Spanish Republic, Don Manuel Azana, now fighting, with his back to the wall, the combined pope's armies of superstitious Italy, atheistic Germany and heathen Morocco, Mr. Gunther reviews the history of some of his achievements in recent years:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As to the church, Azana outlawed it without destroying it; he deprived it of exactly enough power and privilege to make it his relentless enemy for life. Nothing more drastic was known to Spanish history than Azana.’s Religious Orders bill of June 1933. It separated church and state; nationalized all church property valued at £100,000,000; dissolved the Jesuit order and severely restricted the activity of other orders; and forbade the clergy to work at gainful occupations or teach. But within two years, like a black solid and powerful mushroom, the church had protruded again into a dominant position in Spanish life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Azana, like no fewer than six other members of the first republican government, was a Freemason. This contributed in no small measure to his downfall. Masonry, as in France, has played a powerful role in polities in Spain, though one dislikes to simplify the issue too much, to talk too glibly of the dividing line between Masonry and Catholicism as the major motif of the revolution. Indeed the line is illogically awry. Lerroux, the Freemason, and Gil Robles, the Jesuit, are allies. But it is undeniable that in the early days of the republic the Catholic reaction successfully used the label of Masonry to discredit the new regime. [Lerroux is most certainly a Jesuit in disguise.—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ed.]</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark95"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark96"></a>Mussolini, Who Bluffed the World</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Mussolini, who bluffed the whole world to a standstill, furnished the lines which Hitler and all the smaller-fry dictators would like to copy. A past master in the art of propaganda, he, metaphorically speaking, has Hearst and Brisbane and their like eating out of his hand the acorns which he hands to them, and they like it, and try to make everybody else like it. Gunther, in several exceedingly well-written pages on this monstrosity, covers ground familiar to readers of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font7"> but here are a few new points that many will appreciate:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Imagine an Italy,” wrote Mussolini indignantly in 1912, ‘ ‘ in which thirty-six millions should all think the same, as though their brains were made in an identical mould, and you would have a madhouse, or rather, a kingdom of utter boredom or imbecility.” To which, the detached observer might reply, Even so!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At fifty-two Mussolini is in powerfully good health, partly as a result of attention to a severe regime. Shortly after he became prime minister he was desperately ill with a stomach ailment; he eats very little nowadays but milk and fruit. He told a recent American newspaper interviewer, pointing to a basket of fruit on the table, ‘ ‘ That is the secret of my continued health—fruit, fruit, fruit. In the morning I have a cup of coffee and fruit; at noon I have soup or broth and fruit, and at night I have fruit. I never touch meat, but sometimes I have a little fish.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1932 the Duce went to the Vatican, knelt in prayer, and, it is believed, took holy communion. He was an avowed atheist, like his father, in youth; latterly he has become very religious. He prays daily. His wedding-gift to Edda was a golden rosary; his youngest child, Anna-Maria, was his first to be given a religious name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Like all dictators, he is implacable. No Hitler, no Stalin, no Mussolini, has ever forgiven an enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">British Imperialist Adventures</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mussolini was perfectly frank about taking Ethiopia because he wanted it and was restive under the criticisms of that nation that with self-confessed righteousness has fought wars of conquest in every corner of the earth to get for itself what it wanted or to keep the trade routes of the world in its control. Just so as to have it in the record:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From 1788 till 1925 Great Britain fought, it was calculated, approximately twenty campaigns or wars to keep the route to India open. The British fought Napoleon on the Nile, at Trafalgar, at Aboukir, and indirectly at Copenhagen, -which they wantonly bombarded. The British intrigued in Egypt, annexed Aden, invaded Abyssinia, penetrated Persia, and joined the Turks against Russia in the Crimean war. The British acquired Cyprus, extended their control of Egypt, advanced into the Sudan, and fought the Great War to prevent the German </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Drang nach Osten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Recently the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">New Leader</span><span class="font6"> printed a list of ‘‘independent territories” which the British Government has annexed since 1870. Baluchistan, Burma, Cyprus, Weihaiwei, Hong Kong, Kuwait, Sinai, North Guinea, South Guinea, East Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga Islands, Sudan, Uganda, British East Africa, British Somaliland, Zanzibar, Transvaal, Orange Free State, Rhodesia, British Central Africa, Nigeria. In addition, the British Empire was in effect enlarged by mandated territories acquired by the peace settlements of 1919: Palestine, Trans-Jordan, Tanganyika, Togo, Cameroons, Southwest Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A few more telling shots at England:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two per cent of the property owners of England own sixty-four per cent of the national wealth. . . . The ruling classes absorb an acutely disproportionate share of the national income and of economic power. Take, for instance, the city of London. One peer owns no less than two hundred and seventy acres in the West End. Only about forty thousand of the eight million inhabitants of London own any land at all, and the really valuable slices are in the hands of about twenty men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For six days a week the Englishman worships at the Bank of England, and on the seventh day at the Church of England. For religion is a powerful force on the side of the ruling classes.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark97"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark98"></a>Dollfuss and the Socialists</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">In Vienna itself in the days when the Austrian Republic was destroyed by the Roman Catholic dictator Dollfuss, it was inevitable that Mr. Gunther should have been greatly impressed, and have impressed his readers, by what he saw and knew of one of the greatest tragedies that have come to the plain people of the earth since the Great War. It is impossible to do more than touch upon this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Vienna the socialists produced a remarkable administration, making it probably the most successful municipality in the world. By means of an ingenious if Draconian taxation system they financed paternalistic reforms of unparalleled quantity and quality; they built health clinics, baths, gymnasia, sanatoria, schools, kindergartens, and the imposing sunshine dwellings which, in decency and cleanliness if not in luxury, housed sixty thousand families—socialist families. They eliminated slums; they cut down drastically the tuberculosis rate; they took money from the rich, who could spare it, and used it for the benefit of the worthy poor. The achievements of the Vienna socialists were the most exhilarating social monument of the post-War period in any European country. Result: the clericals bombed them out of existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mr. Gunther does not exactly say it, but might as well, that the real business, and the only business of the clericals, i.e., the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and their allies, is to dishonor God and make the lots of their fellow men, excepting only the lickspittles and hypocrites, just as hard as is possible to make them. That is why Fascism, Catholic Action, is so desperately and insanely bent on the destruction of every form of people’s government in every part of the earth, and finds such satisfaction and receives such support in Hearst rags and other human impedimenta.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark99"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark100"></a>Disobedience Brings Irretrievable Loss to Posterity</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">N</span><span class="font7">O KING that ever reigned on this earth began his rule under such peculiarly favorable circumstances as did King Saul, the first king of Israel. Literally, he was Jehovah’s choice for the position which he filled; literally, he sat upon the throne of Jehovah, and ruled for Him. He had it in his power to reign indefinitely, and to know that his sons and his sons’ sons would continue after him; yet disobedience spoiled it all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The story of Saul really begins with Samuel, the last of the judges, dear to Jehovah God, and dear to all God’s people. A Levite of the family of Kohath, whence came Aaron and his sons, Samuel seems to have combined in his person many of the attributes of a prophet, priest and king in the theocracy which began with the call of Moses at the burning bush.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Samuel was a gift from God to Hannah and her husband Elkanah. (The story that Elkanah was of the family of Kohath is from 1 Chronicles 6:33-38.) Before the promise came to Hannah that she should become a mother Elkanah said to her, most tenderly: “Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved ? am not I better to thee than ten sons?” (1 Samuel 1: 8) It would be hard to think of any husband speaking more comfortingly, or more concernedly, to his wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the child was weaned Hannah brought him to Eli the priest, at Shiloh, that he might “appear before [Jehovah], and there abide for ever”. (1 Samuel 1: 22) And when Hannah told Eli that she had “lent him to Jehovah; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to Jehovah” (1 Samuel 1: 28), Samuel, little as he was, “worshipped Jehovah there.” The paean of praise which then flowed from Hannah’s lips reminds one of Mary’s song of thanksgiving (Luke 1:46-55), and reveals what an altogether splendid inheritance Samuel had besides the three bullocks, the flour and the wine that were brought with him. The Lord subsequently blessed Hannah with three additional sons and two daughters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That Samuel himself was a blessing to Eli in his old age goes without saying, but he was more than that; he was a living reproof to Eli, weak and irresolute, and to his wicked sons, Hophni and Phinehas, who had disgraced the priestly office by adultery and extortion.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark101"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark102"></a>“To the Pure All Things Are Pure”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Because Samuel was pure of heart he grew up unaffected, in any evil way, by the evils about him. What could be more touching than his childish innocence when the Lord God Almighty called him thrice by name in the still watches of the night, and he knew not who it was, supposing it to be Eli?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Finally it was made clear to Samuel that it was Jehovah that was calling him, and he received his first message from the great God, and repeated it, every word, to Eli, that the house of Eli was to be destroyed. Eli’s response was, “It is [Jehovah]: let him do what seemeth him good.”—1 Samuel 3:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It all came to pass as foretold. War ensued with the Philistines. There was a great slaughter. Hophni and Phinehas were slain, and the ark of God was taken, and when Eli heard the news he fell backward and died. The ark was taken to Ashdod; and it makes the child of God laugh to see what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Philistines brought the ark into the presence of Dagon, in the house of Dagon, and left it over night. The next morning Dagon was on his face before the ark. They tried it again, and on the second morning Dagon was again before the ark, minus his head and his hands, “cut off upon the threshold”; there was nothing left but the stump. Despite this terrible rebuke, the Roman Catholic cult still uses the headpiece of the god Dagon for caps for bishops and such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After seven months’ entertainment of the ark, in which time all the men of Ashdod sorely needed the constant services of some eminent proctologist (1 Samuel 5:6-12), the Philistines concluded they had best send the ark back to where it belonged. They agreed to make a test. They would load the ark on a cart drawn by two cattle, milch cows. The calves would be left behind. If the cattle, left to their own devices, would go to Beth-shemesh, in Israelite territory, eighteen miles away in a straight line, then the Philistines would know for a certainty that the things that had happened to them were from Jehovah. And that is just what took place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Carried away with excitement (like the 20,000 maniacs that rushed to Owensboro, Ky., to see a woman sheriff hang a Negro at 5:30 in the morning), 50,070 looked into the ark of Jehovah at Beth-shemesh, in flat disobedience of the Word of God, and died for their transgression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Fear fell upon all Israel. The ark was carried twelve miles farther back, to Kirjath-jearim, and there remained twenty years. A generation passed, and another. Meantime Samuel, acting for Jehovah God, ruled the people well; the Philistines were subdued; lost cities were restored; there was peace on the eastern border.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark103"></a>When Samuel Became Old</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">When Samuel became old, and his sons walked not after his ways, but turned aside for bribes, the people of Israel clamored for a king. Jehovah told him to grant the request, saying to him, “They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.” He then instructed Samuel to tell the people the difference between the kingdom of God, a true Theocracy (such as the earth will have forever), and the monarchies which are passing, but which they wanted to establish:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots. And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties, and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots. And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants. And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants. And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work. He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants. And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you, and [Jehovah] will not hear you in that day.—1 Samuel 8:11-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The people still wanted a king, and God selected for them the tallest man in the entire land, Saul, the son of Kish, a Benjamite. “From his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.” (1 Samuel 9: 2) Samuel was told of the choice, and was told that Saul would come to see him on another errand, all of which was fulfilled. The unseen messengers of God were directing the whole affair. Saul was kept overnight and the next morning, privately, was anointed and told he was to be Israel’s first king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Samuel said to Saul: “On whom is all the desire of Israel ? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father’s house ?” Saul made the modest reply: “Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel ? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin?” (1 Samuel 9:20,21) It would have been better for him if he had retained that meek and lowly spirit to the end of his career. Many people cannot stand promotions or prosperity, which is one reason why God’s people are mostly of the humbler walks of life.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark104"></a>Samuel Reassured Saul</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Samuel reassured Saul, proving to him that he was indeed the anointed of the Lord. He told him that the asses he had been seeking were found; that on his way home at a certain spot he would meet three men, what they would have with them, and what gifts they would give him; that when he came to the garrison of the Philistines (for Israel at this time was a militarily-occupied country) a company of prophets would meet him with musical instruments and that when they prophesied he would prophesy with them. All this came to pass, exactly as foretold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Saul should have had the faith in God to accept these things as from the Lord, but he seems to have acted as if in a daze. Samuel called all Israel to Mizpeh to appear before Jehovah. He warned them that they had rejected God as their ruler; they were now to select a king by lot. The lot was cast, and unerringly, lot by lot, the tribe of Benjamin, the kindred of Matri, the family of Kish, and the person of Saul was chosen. Samuel knew that it would be so; and Saul seems to have known it also, for when sought he could not be found. He was finally discovered hidden among the baggage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When he was brought forth Samuel said, “See ye him whom Jehovah hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people.” With his great stature, ‘higher than any of the people, from his shoulders and upward,’ Saul did indeed present a fine appearance. Indeed the Scriptures say of him that he was “a choice young man, and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he”. So when the people saw him they all shouted [rendered in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.F.,</span><span class="font7"> margin, “Let the king live”] “God save the king”, and from that day to this that shout has gone up from every quarter of the earth in praise of selfish men that have done, as kings, all the things God said such men would do when the power was in their hands.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark105"></a>Saul Thus Became King</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Saul thus became king by the act of God, but in deference to the wish of the people. He did not at first exercise his kingly power, but went back to his farm. One day, returning from his work, he found all the people weeping. When he asked why they wept it was explained to him that the Ammonites were encamped around Jabesh-Gilead, on the other side of Jordan, and in seven days, if nobody came to their relief, all the men of the city were to lose their right eyes, for a reproach upon all Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This had the right effect upon Saul. Straightway he hewed a yoke of oxen in pieces and sent the pieces by messengers all over the land. All Israel were to meet him at the rendezvous, Bezek, at once; and they did so, 330,000 men. That night the whole army forded the Jordan and scattered the Ammonites so completely that not two of them were left together. It was a great victory, and though the people were loud in their praises of Saul, Saul also loudly said, “Today [Jehovah] hath wrought salvation in Israel.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Samuel suggested that all the people go to Gilgal and there renew the kingdom. This was done. There Samuel reminded the people that he was old and his day was nearly done. He reminded them also that none could say he had ever wronged any. As a witness that he had done right, and that they had erred in asking for a king to reign over them, he called upon the Lord, in the time of wheat harvest, to send thunder and rain, most unusual in Palestine at that time of year, and it came. At this point Samuel virtually surrendered the office of king to Saul, though he was still God’s representative in the priestly office. Saul was soon put to the test.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In his administration of the priestly office Samuel observed every requirement with the most punctilious care. God had said that Eli’s descendants would come to His priest “and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a piece of bread” (1 Samuel 2:36); and that was just about what took place, for after Eli and his sons Hophni and Phinehas were dead Saul had the grandson of Phinehas doing priestly- work. (1 Samuel 14:3) Saul had no right to do this himself, none whatever. It appertained only to the tribe of Levi, of whom both Samuel and Ahiah (the grandson of Phinehas) were representatives. This was God’s arrangement, not Samuel’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Saul Loses His Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It seems that the people of Israel soon tired of having a king over them, besides the garrisons of the Philistines, which they also had to support. The Philistines maintained these garrisons so that they could make sure that the Hebrew's made themselves neither swords nor spears; they looked after all the hardware business themselves, and did the sharpening of ploughshares, coulters, axes and mattocks. How like that is to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy! they want to keep everything in their own hands, constantly fearing the people’s knowledge of how to do anything on their own account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Saul started in a modest way in what some would call “the king business”. He had 2,000 retainers at Michmash, and his son Jonathan 1,000 more at Gibeah, a dozen miles away. The Philistine garrison was at Geba, in between. Jonathan had some kind of brush with this garrison, and war was on. The Philistines came up with 30,000 chariots, 6,000 horsemen and a vast army that made Saul’s and Jonathan’s little armies look ridiculous. The men began to desert and to hide in the caves and thickets and rocks and high places and pits until Saul’s 2,000 were reduced to 600 men, and the reduced army seemed to have included Jonathan’s company also, so that four-fifths had fled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the critical time Saul became overanxious to know what to do. He did not realize that only the power of God was holding the vast army of the Philistines in restraint. Samuel was to come in seven days, but delayed. Saul lost both his faith and his patience and took matters in his own hands. Realizing that Israel’s only hope was in God, he took upon himself the duties of a priest and made a burnt offering to Jehovah. In the midst of the offering Samuel appeared and inquired what had been done. Saul explained; and then Samuel, speaking for the Lord, said to Saul:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of [Jehovah] thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would [Jehovah] have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever. But now thy kingdom shall not continue: [Jehovah] hath sought him a man after his own heart, and [Jehovah] hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which [Jehovah] commanded thee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Von Ranke’s History of the Reformation </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">{Quotation continued from page 207)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The financial relations to Rome, generally, excited the greatest attention. It was calculated that the barefooted monks, who were not permitted by their rule to touch money, collected a yearly income of 200,000 gulden ($80,000); the whole body of mendicant friars, a million.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The cities felt the exemptions enjoyed by the clergy peculiarly burthensome. It was impossible to devise anything more annoying to a well-ordered civic community, than to have within their walls a corporate body which neither acknowledged the jurisdiction of the city, nor contributed to bear its burthens, nor deemed itself generally subject to its regulations. The churches were asylums for criminals, the monasteries the resort of dissolute youth; we find examples of monks who made use of their exemption from tolls, to import goods for sale, or to open a tavern for the sale of beer. If any attempt was made to assail their privileges, they defended themselves with excommunication and interdict.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Things had gone so far that the constitution of the clergy was offensive to public morals; a multitude of ceremonies and rules were attributed to the mere desire of making money; the situation of priests living in a state of concubinage and burthened with illegitimate children, and often, in spite of all purchased absolutions, tormented in conscience and oppressed with the fear that in performing the sacrifice of the mass they committed a deadly sin, excited mingled pity and contempt; most of those who embraced the monastic profession had no other idea than that of leading a life of self-indulgence without labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">People saw that the clergy took from every class and station only what was agreeable, and avoided what was laborious and painful. From the knightly order, the prelate borrowed his brilliant company, his numerous retinue, the splendidly caparisoned horse, and the hawk upon his fist; with women he shared the love of gorgeous chambers and trim gardens; but the weight of the mailed coat, the troubles of the household, he had the dexterity to avoid. If a man wishes to enjoy himself for once, says an old proverb, let him kill a fat fowl; if for a year, let him take a wife; but if he would live joyously all the days of his life, then let him turn priest.</span></p>

The plane made thirty trips, each time carrying ten calves, sewed in sacks, to discourage too much walking around while aloft.</span></p>
