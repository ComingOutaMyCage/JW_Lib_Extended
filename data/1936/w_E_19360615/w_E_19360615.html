<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Vfhen the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.”—Ps. 102:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH caused his glory to begin to be made manifest to his servants after he had sent his Messenger, Christ Jesus, straightway to the temple. The Chief One of Jehovah’s capital organization is Christ Jesus, and he. appears at the temple as the representative of Jehovah, and thus he builds up Zion. All power in heaven and in earth ha\ ing been committed by Jehovah to the Lord Jesus, the appearing of Jesus at the temple and the building up of Zion is in fact the appearing of Jehovah and the shining forth is Jehovah’s glory. Jesus Christ is the express image of Jehovah, and the glory of Jehovah is made to appear by and through Christ Jesus. At the temple Christ Jesus is accompanied by his retinue of angels, who serve him and do his bidding, as he ihe great Judge sits upon his throne of glory. (Matt. 25: 31) The time is the day of judgment, which judgment begins at the house of God, and which pertains particularly to those who arc in a covenant to do the will of God, whether that covenant be actual or by implication. It was at the coming of the Lord to the temple that the unfolding of the prophecies began, and those who arc received and made a part of the temple organization, or Zion, sec and appreciate the prophecies as the Lord unfolds them. Those who are in a covenant to do the will of God but whom the Lord finds to be unfaithful when he appears and judges at Ihc temple do not sec or understand the fulfillment of the prophecies. For that reason there are those who claim to be in the truth but who fail to see present truth and hence doubt that there is really any evidence of the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. Such persons find themselves trying to locate themselves by reason of chronology, and, being unable to do so, they lose what little light they once possessed. Had such persons been unselfishly looking to the faithful performance of the covenant which they had made, and to the vindication of Jehovah’s name, doubtless they would have laid hold on the promises and clearly discerned and appreciated the prophecies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Those who have not been approved and received into the temple even raise objections to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch-toicer,</span><span class="font4"> saying that it is only the expression of the opinion of man and therefore cannot be relied upon. Others, who have had a desire to shine in the eyes of men, make remarks of this nature, to wit: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> does not contain sufficient information to enable me to prepare from it a discourse for the friends.” Being complainers, murmurers and faultfinders, both of the objectors here named are in the same class. (Jude 1G) </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> does not attempt the expression of the opinion of any man concerning prophecy, but in the language of the Scriptures continues to declare that prophecy is not of private interpretation. (2 Pet. 1:20) Since the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple as the representative of his Father he causes to be brought to the attention of those who love him the physical facts showing fulfillment of prophecy, and, setting these facts alongside the words of the prophecy, those who love God arc enabled to see how such facts fit the prophecy and thus show the fulfillment theicof. Being wholly devoted to Jehovah, such arc not concerned about chronology, but accept what the Lord clearly reveals, and that is usually after the date under consideration is past. They are not speculating as to the time when they are go'ng to get off the earth and be taken to heaven. They have engaged to serve Jehovah for ex er, and fully appreciate the fact that it is not for the creature to determine or even attempt to determine just when his service on the earth may cease and when he may be transferred to heavenly realms. The chief objective of the faithful servant class is to serve Jehovah and his kingdom, knowing full well that the Lord is directing their course and will bring about the result according to his holy will. 'Whether Armageddon is one year or many years in the future is not material to the faithful servant class. These faithful ones have entered into the joy of the Lord, which is the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and, knowing that Armageddon will vindicate Jehovah’s name, the faithful servant class are perfectly willing to wait on the Lord and continue loyally and faithfully serving him. These faithful ones are in the Lord’s organization, and by the grace of the Lord they delight to remain there for ever, and the place of service they do not even care to choose. They well know that God assigns all mem-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">bars to a place in the body as it pleases him and doubtless assigns all in his organization to a place, and that he requires of each and every one full obedience and faithfulness.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> The faithful servants of the Lord do not fret themselves concerning the others who fail to do their duty. Each servant stands or falls to his master, and therefore the faithful one is deeply concerned about proving his own integrity and he knows that he cannot succeed in doing so by finding fault with others who appear to fail or who do fail to faithfully perform. It is entirely proper for the brethren to point out to one another the great privilege of serving God and his kingdom and to urge one another to do all he can to magnify the name of Jehovah, but such admonition should always be given in kindness and never by way of harsh criticism. All at the temple will be in exact harmony and will dwell together and work together in peace to the glory of God, which means the forgetting of self and the magnifying of the name of Jehovah. “In his temple doth every one speak of his [Jehovah’s] glory.’’—I&gt;S. 29:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> These faithful ones deeply appreciate the loving-kindness of God in causing his prophecies to be written centuries ago for the special benefit of his faithful servants now on the earth. As those prophecies arc unfolded by the Lord each one of the temple receives the same joyfully. They know that prophecy docs not proceed from men, but from God, and is made clear in these last days that the man of God may be thoroughly furnished and prepared for all good work.— 2 Tini. 3: 1G, 17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> All prophecy having the same objective, that is to say, the vindication of Jehovah’s name, the same physical facts fulfill different prophecies. It may appear, therefore, that physical facts are often repeated in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoiver,</span><span class="font4"> and the critical ones will say and do say: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> continues to speak about the same thing.” The answer to that is, that the Lord God was pleased to treat the same matter in a number of different prophecies, his purpose manifestly being to furnish an abundant amount of corroborative testimony for the aid, comfort and hope of the remnant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> Among the prophecies Jehovah caused to be written is that of Obadiah, and according to Ilis fixed rule that prophecy was written for the understanding of the remnant and for the aid and comfort of such class, and for that reason it is to be expected that the Lord will give the remnant an understanding of the prophecy of Obadiah in these last days. The prophecy of Obadiah clearly is present truth, which is received by the remnant with great joy. It foretells the doom of the religionists, that is, the men who have organized and carried on a work in the name of the Lord yet who have defamed the name of Jehovah for these many centuries past. The prophecy discloses the present duty and work of the faithful witnesses of Jehovah in exposing the duplicity and hypocrisy of the Homan Catholic Hierarchy and other clergy allied with that wicked organization, which for years have ruled the people in an arrogant and scornful manner. Those religionists have claimed to be heirs of God's promise and his favored ones, but they have ignored God’s Word and employed their own selfish schemes and have advanced their own selfish doctrines in an effort to accomplish their wicked end. It is certain that the understanding of this prophecy at the present crisis will be a real comfort to the faithful witnesses of Jehovah. The prophecy is therefore considered in minute detail.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>T</sup> The name Obadiah means “serving Jehovah” or “servant of Jehovah”; which shows that the prophecy is for the servant class of Jehovah. The understanding is particularly for the remnant class and must be proclaimed within the hearing of all persons of &quot;ood will, and this must be done before the wrath of Jehovah falls upon the wicked, hypocritical religionists. The identity of Obadiah is uncertain. It is not certain whether the prophet, the writer of the prophecy, actually bore that name Obadiah or used the name Obadiah as an appropriate title for the prophecy. This is very interesting for the reason it suggests that in the fulfillment of this prophecy the personal identity of those who compose the servant class, whom Obadiah pictured, is neither necessary nor important. Tin-, excludes the reason and opportunity for peisonal shining and adulation. To be sure, the Lord Jean, who is the head of the servant class, is always definitely identified; but as to the persons who are made members of that servant class, their identity is not at all important except for their own special benefit. This is exactly as we should expert it to be in this day. There is no occasion, then, to give any special honor to any man or men. The special adulation and honoring of men is for the past, and at the present time it finds, or at least should find, no place amoimst God's people. This further explains also that some of tho e once of the servant class may fall away and hence a change in the personnel of the servant body be made, but the purpose and the work of the servant class are never altered. There is no individual of the servant class who is so very important that he must be set up on a pedestal. What counts with the Lord is faithfulness in the performance of duty. Those who remain of the servant class must be dependable; and if some become unreliable they will be quickly set aside, but this would in no wise affect the result concerning the work and the purpose of the servant class.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> As to the time when this unidentified Obadiah lived and prophesied, it is not definitely fixed by the Scriptures. It is uncertain as to whether the prophecy v,as written before or after the fall of Jerusalem ai the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, but the application of the prophecy is not at all uncertain. That is the important time and matter. The name as well as the propl '.cy oi Obadiah itself indicates clearly that it appbi &gt;&nbsp;to and is fulfilled in the time when God has raised up his servant class and brought them into the temple, which is after he (Jehovah) has returned to Zion and by his chief officer, Christ Jesus, has built up Zion and appeared in his glory, which is from and after the year A.D. 1918. It appears from the facts and the prophecy itself that its fulfillment began after the second outpouring of the holy spirit: “And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall drcam dreams, your young men shall see visions; and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit. ’’—Joel 2: 28, 29.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">’Jehovah gave his servant and prophet a vision: “The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord God concerning Edom, We have heard a rumour from the Lord, and an ambassador is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.’’ (Verse 1) The class pictured by Obadiah is doubtless the same as Ihe watchman whom God foretold by his prophet Isaiah': “The burden [load, thing lifted up] of Dumah” [meaning “silence’’; as stated by Jeremiah: “The Lord our God hath put us to silence’’ (Jer. 8:14,15)]. “Jie [the prisoner class, those under restraint] calleth to me out of Seir [that is, meaning “rough”, like a satyr or goat, Ihe Devil], Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night? The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night; if ye will inquire, inquire ye; return, come [again].”—Isa. 21:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’“Mount Seir was the country of the Edomites, which pictured the political and hypocritical icligions leaders who claim the birthright to the kingdom but who are in truth and in fact the representatives of the Devil. The watchman mentioned is Jehovah’s anointed witnesses, who must be constantly on the watch in behalf of the interests of the kingdom of God under Christ and sec to it that they do not compromise with any part of Satan’s organization. The watchmen or servant class must be blind to everything except the kingdom of God and its intciests. (Isa. 42:19) That c’ass must hear the Yv’ord of God at his mouth and be diligent to proclaim it in the presence and hearing of others who have an car to hear. “So thou, 0 son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me.”—Ezek. 33: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” The watchman class is made up of those who are not to hold their peace and say nothing because of fear of the enemy or hope for some favor from the enemy. “I have set watchmen upon thy walls, 0 Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night; ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not silence. ’ ’—Isa. 62: 6.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> Recently when some who had been occupying positions of more than ordinary importance in the Society’s organization and work in the land of Germany were put on trial, charged with having attempted to carry on God’s work contrary to the laws of the German government, there w<sup>r</sup>as a complete failure on the part of those thus charged to observe the above commandment of the Lord. Not only did those men fail to mention the name of Jehovah and of his kingdom and King, Christ Jesus, -which thej<sup>r</sup> had agreed to serve and to obey, but, on the contrary, they compromised with the enemy by saying that they had done nothing to further the interests of the kingdom of God contrary to the laws of Germany. A copy of the testimony taken before the court that tried these cases at Halle contains the following, and the quotations are taken from that court record, and, without finding it necessary to mention any names, we call, as that record did, the ones charged by the term “defendant”. One of these defendants testified before the court, using these words: “We did everything in our power to avoid any action against Ihe decree [of Germany forbidding the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom] because we believed, and today still believe, that the government [of Germany] docs not intend to rob the individual Christian of his faith, that religious fne-dom exists, and that things would develop in such a way that it would be possible for the individual Christian to worship his (tod. It is my conviction that the only way to obtain results is through negotiations with the government, and 1 have asked 1he friends not to do anything which would interfere with these negotiations. All information issued was according to the foregoing.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> Clearly the language here quoted is equivalent to saying, We must ask some earthly power as to whether or not we shall worship and serve Almighty God. At that same court trial held at Halle December 17, 1935, another one of the Society’s representatives v.ho was charged with violating the German decree testified in his own behalf, and the following is quoted from the official record:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">“Question by chairman of the court: ‘Did you consider it permissible io further faithfully stand together to carry on a work?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Answer by defendant: ‘I would consider that a violation of the law.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Question by chairman of the court: ‘Was anything said about all remaining true to the faith?’ To which defendant made this answer: ‘This was not spoken of. . . . We rather tried to hinder an organized holding together of the friends in the faith. The various officers [of the Society] had no right to organize and encourage such.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Question bj’ attorney: ‘At the conferences which took place in Magdeburg between the service directors, was it there said that the various individuals should seek to find a means of existence and at the same time should be illegally active?’ Answer by defendant: ‘No, on the contrary. 1 suggested on one occasion that such gentlemen who had been active should cease their activity.’ ”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> The above quotations of the testimony of the defendants were entirely contrary to what God’s Word commands and directly contrary to what the Society holds must be done and what those representatives had been instructed that they should do. Such words show a compromise with the enemy. Those who are faithful to God and his kingdom must obey his commandments regardless of what any earthly power may decree or command. No one can prove faithful to God and maintain his integrity toward God and at the same time compromise with the enemy by failing or refusing to serve God by reason of fear of the enemies of God and his kingdom. Lukewarmness is an abomination in the sight of God. (Rev. 3:16) Jehovah’s witnesses love him, and they prove this by their boldness in bearing testimony to the truth in the day of judgment. (1 John 4:17,18) The judges trying the above eases must have clearly seen the attitude of compromise, and defendants received no consideration at their hands. It would be inconsistent for the Society to do anything in their behalf, after they have proved unfaithful to the Lord under stress.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1S</sup> In contrast with the testimony given by the aforementioned representatives in Germany a number of faithful witnesses of Jehovah in that land have demonstrated their faithfulness, boldness and firmness in the declaration of the truth at all times, and, by the grace of the Lord, they continue to give testimony in the name of Jehovah and bis King regardless of persecution. As an example of the determination of many of the faithful ones in Germany to stand firm, the following incident is quoted, which is taken from a report received from that country: “In one concentration camp there are 600 of Jehovah’s witnesses. Every day they arc called out and mistreated, then the official calls out and says: ‘Bible Students or Jehovah’s witnesses, step forward. How many of you will remain Jehovah’s witnesses?’ Every one raised their hands, thus testifying for the Lord and his kingdom.’’ There arc many such faithful and loyal brethren in that land. In Germany 2,894 of Jehovah’s witnesses have been imprisoned, many of whom arc still in prison. Many of such hesitate not to testify to the truth and stand firm for the Lord and his kingdom. In no other way can one be faithful to the Lord. The experience concerning Daniel, Meshach, Shadrach and Abcd-nego, as recorded in the Bible, is an example of the proper attitude of one who is in a covenant to do God’s will. All the faithful will follow the same course. Jehovah is able to sustain his witnesses, and nothing can come to them except by his permission. Such faithful ones have the assurance that the Lord is directing their way. (Prov. 3: 5, 6) “And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.”—Rom. 8: 28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>16</sup> The experiences recorded concerning Job prove that Jehovah permits severe tests to come upon his people that they may have opportunity to prove their devotion to and integrity toward God. If one compromises with the enemy and suffers from that, such suffering avails nothing. If one suffers because of his faithfulness to the Lord, happy is he, because that suffering is like the suffering that came upon Christ Jesus. “But rejoice, inasmuch as ye arc partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may bo glad also with exceeding jov.”— 1 Pet. 4:13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>17</sup> The faithful are now rejoicing in the Lord that they are permitted to fill up some of the sufferings of Christ left over. (Col. 1:24) Attention is called to these things, not for the mere purpose of criticizing anyone, but that those who arc subjected to the test may see and have in mind what is the proper cour.-e for one who has undertaken to do the will of God. Many of the brethren in New Jersey have been subjected to similar experiences and in the face of all such persecution have stood firm and immovable for the Lord and his kingdom. “It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him. If we suffer, we shall also reign with him; if we deny him, he also will deny us.” (2 Tim. 2:11, 12) Each one must determine which side he is on and prove his position by the constant and faithful course of action taken.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> Referring to those who find occasion to say before the brethren: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> contains nothing but the opinion of a man; we have been mistaken in the past, and why not understand that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watehtowe r </span><span class="font4">is now mistaken?” Such persons should remember that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> sets out the words of God's prophet and alongside that prophecy sets down the physical facts well known to all, that each one who is of the temple class may readily decide what is and what is not in fulfillment of the prophecy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>19</sup> Now, concerning the prophecy of Obadiah, note that this statement is made: “Thus saith the Loid God.” Obadiah’s uttered words are therefore not a dream or a hallucination or a man’s guess or opinion, but the sure and unfailing Word of Jehovah God. The purpose of the prophecy is to enlighten the remnant of God’s people now on the earth that they mielit stand strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. Likewise </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> emphasizes the Word of God and not the guess or opinion of man. God and Christ Jesus are the teachers, and the anointed do not need the aid of some self-constituted wise cxegete. To such anointed ones this scripture applies: “But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you; but as the same anointing tcachcth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.”—1 John 2:27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> The Lord God gave Obadiah his word “concerning Edom”. The nickname of Esau was Edom: “E-au, who is Edom.” (Gen. 36:1) The name means “red” and is a reminder of Esau’s failure to appreciate God’s favor toward him concerning the Abrahamic birthright, which Esau sold for the paltry sum of a mess of pottage, that his selfish appetite might be appeased. “And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom [that is to say, lied </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(margin)].”</span><span class="font4"> (Gen. 25:30) In this prophecy of Obadiah the term Edom must of necessity apply first to the offspring of Esau, together with the country or place which they inhabited, and in fulfillment thereof to a people once in line for the Abrahamic birthright.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> Unlike Jacob’s descendants, the offspring of Esau or Edom was not pure Semitic stock, for the reason that Esau married outside of Abraham’s family relation. Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan, the cursed one. (Gen. 9: 25) “Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan ; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Ahohbamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibcon the Ilivite; and Bashemalh, Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Ncbajoth.” (Gen. 26:2,3) Ishmael -was a son of Abraham by Hagar, an Egyptian woman, and was therefore a descendant of Ham. (Gen. 16:1) Ishmael’s daughter Bashemath was one of the wives of Esau. ‘And Ishmael took his wife out of the land of Egypt.’ (Gen. 21:21) All of Esau’s children were of a mixed blood, and therefore, all Edomites wore children of an improper union of Esau with Hamitic women. It was therefore impossible for the Edomites to be God’s holy nation. Esau was a brother of Jacob, a grandson of Abraham. The father and mother of Jacob and Esau were Isaac and Rebecca. Esau was the firstborn and apparently had the first claim to the Abrahamic birthright, but it was the will of God that it should be otherwise. (Gen. 22:18; 25:23-26) The descendants of Esau, that is, the Edomites, must therefore represent a class of perrons who are apparently the firstborn and in line for the kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> The following definition is published in the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government,</span><span class="font4"> page 283: ‘‘The name Edom represents that which is opposed to the Lord. It has the same meaning as ‘Esau’, and therefore refers to the organization of Satan, the most reprehensible element of which is ecelesiastieism.” Here enlarging upon tliat definition, that it may be made more specific, it is stated that Esau or Edom more specifically stands for and represents that class of men who have organized and carried on religion in the name of God and Christ, but who in truth and in fact have been and are the representatives of the Devil, and hence a part of the Devil’s organization. That clearly shows that antitypical Edomites are made up of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their clergy allies who have used the Word of God for a selfish purpose. The miniature or first fulfillment of this part of the prophecy of Obadiah was in the clergy of the time when Jesus was on the earth. The priests and Pharisees of that time claimed to be children of Abraham, and hence in line for the kingdom blessings that were promised to Abraham, but Jesus told them that they were the sons of the Devil. (John 8:13,37-44) Those hypocritical men were the ones who rejected the Stone, Christ Jesus, upon which God has builded his church, and to whom Christ Jesus said: ‘‘Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken ; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder. And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.” (Matt. 21:43-45) The counterpart of the priests and Pharisees of that day are the clergy of the present time, and particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> Edom, the offspring of Esau, therefore clearly stands for the official religious representatives of the Devil, to wit, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their allies, the other clergy. Today Protestantism is dead; which was pictured by the young lion slain by Samson. Those clergymen who organized and carried on the so-called ‘‘Protestant religion” are joined together with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy; and it has been true since the World War, at which time and since this combined crowd has sought the death of the true followers of Christ Jesus. The clergy of the Catholic and so-called “Protestant” organizations are vigorously working together at this day to destroy the true followers of the Lord. As the Edomites sought to Kill Jesus when he was on the earth (John 8:37-44), so the modern-day Edomites seek to bring about the death of the member's of Christ now on the earth, and therefore they ‘thus do unto the Lord Jesus himself’ in this day ; and because these are his faithful followers he counts them as a part of himself. While this article is being prepared the clergy of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and the so-called “Protestant” clergy, arc attempting to frame mischief by law by causing bills to be introduced in the New Jersey Legislature, and in other state legislatures, making it a crime for anyone to refuse to salute the flag or to write or publish anything setting forth the reason why a Christian cannot salute a flag and thereby attribute salvation to men. Otherwise stated, the clergy seek the destruction of Jehovah’s witnesses because they insist that a true follower of Christ Jesus must obey God rather than men. (Acts 5:29) The clergy arc the antitypical Edomites and are the most deceptive and reprehensible part of Satan’s visible organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> The Abrahamic birthright privileges were claimed by the clergy because they have always claimed to be the ones favored of God. Jehovah foreknew that they would be unfaithful and would fall away completely to the Devil, and therefore he foretold such in this prophecy concerning the Edomites. The Abrahamic birthright privileges a&lt; held out to and claimed by the clergy, Jesus foretold would be taken away from them because they failed to bring forth the fruits (the truth) of the kingdom. It is only the clergy that have tried to compete with Jehovah’s true saints for the kingdom privileges. This corresponds exactly with Esau’s rivalry toward Jacob for the birthright of his father. Esau tried to kill Jacob, and the antitypical Edomites likewise now try to kill and destroy Jehovah’s true witnesses, pictured by Jacob. At verse seven of Obadiah's prophecy it is stated that the Edomites entered into a conspiracy against the true followers of Christ. That same verse also refers to the two other elements of Satan’s organization, which form “the principal of the flock’’, all of which are falsely called “Christians’’. In the modern fulfillment of the prophecy the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their so-called “Protestant” allied clergymen lead in a conspiracy against God’s “hidden ones”, whom he has selected to be members of his holy nation. The “principal of the flock” have joined in this conspiracy and are now this day committing overt acts against the people of God, and against his kingdom. The modern Edomites are therefore clearly identified and located by the Word of God and the indisputable physical facts, all of which exactly fit the words of the prophecy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JUDGMENT TIDINGS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> The prophecy indicates that it is a specific class of persons, and not just one person, that hear the “rumour”, or “tidings”. “We have heard a rumour [(L’.l<sup>7</sup>.) tidings] from the Lord.” (Verse 1) It is God's servant class, to whom the kingdom interests on earth are committed, that hear these judgment tidings from the Lord. They being devoted to the Lord, their ears are attuned to the good news that proceeds from the Lord. Others do not have their cars so attuned, and because they arc on the side of the enemy they do not hear, and therefore know nothing, about the judgment of the Lord. Continuing the prophet says: “An ambassador is sent among the heathen |the nations (/LT<sup>7</sup>.)].” The Hebrew word -used here for “ambassador” is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">tzecr,</span><span class="font4"> and means one who is constrained by a principle, or God’s rule of action, and is therefore engaged in a pressing or urgent service. Mindful of his privilege and obligation, the ambassador is on the alert to faithfully perform the service assigned to him. Wiiose ambassador? It is the messenger or ambassador of the Lord, for the reason that the Devil would not stir up his own nations against Edom, whom the Devil has employed so well against God’s faithful people. The prophecy suggests that the ambassador is a heavenly messenger or angel, one of the “seven stars” in the right hand of Jesus Christ, the same as the angel of Revelation 8: 3-5, and 16:12: “The sixth angel poured out his vial . . . that the way of the kings of the cast might be prepared.” The angel of Revelation 19:17-21 assembles God’s army against the “beast”, the “false prophet” and the “kings”, but not against the old “whore”, of which Edom is the most prominent part.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>26</sup> After perceiving the call of the ambassador or angel of the Lord, then those composing the Lord’s remnant on earth, his witnesses, like their prototype Obadiah, take up the judgment tidings and herald the same to others, both inside and outside of the remnant class. They speak to each other of the Lord’s judgments and tell others who have the hearing ear of the judgments of the Lord. Note that the ambassador is not sent to the Devil’s army, but sent to the members of God’s organization on earth, who arc found scattered amongst the nations but who are no part of the nations of this world. Jehovah is calling or summoning his own people. It is Christ Jesus and his army that do the treading of Edom and Bozrah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>27</sup> The Lord’s ambassador or messenger brings these tidings: “Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.” The angelic army of Christ Jesus, or hosts of heaven, to which God's remnant on earth must now be attached, is commanded to arise for battle against the enemy. The prophecy of Obadiah is fully corroborated by God’s prophecy by the mouth of Jeremiah: “For I have sworn by myself, saith the Lord, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.”-—Jer. 49: 13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> The day of battle is nigh, and Jehovah makes known the purpose toward antitypical Esau: “For I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I will visit him. ... I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, ami be shall not be able to hide himself.” (Jer. 49: 8,10) For many .wars the Esau class, and particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, has carried on its wicked work- and apparently in secret, and in fact in secret Io many persons, and thereby many millions have been deceived. The -wicked institution has turned the Word of God upside down by teaching exactly opposite, to the true meaning of the Word of God. To that wicked organization Jehovah says: “Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who sccth us? and who knoweth us? Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?”—Isa. 29:15,16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> That hypocritical and devilish crowd have said and continue to say: “We have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves.” But the Lord says to them: “The hail [hard, solid truths] shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters [flood of God's truth] shall overflow the hiding place.” (Isa. 28:15-17) That the Lord says he will do in his “judgment time”. Such is not the battle of Armageddon, because in that scourge of Armageddon Jehovah by Christ Jesus and his army will completely .annihilate all of the enemy. When Jehovah says here, “Arise ye,’’ it means to battle “against her”, the enemy. This battle spoken of is now in progress, and is a battle of truth against entrenched lies. It is a battle between Jehovah’s witnesses on one side and hypocritical religionists, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, on the other, and takes place just preceding and preliminary to “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>80</sup> Note now the corroborative proof given by the prophet: “And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel [spiritual Israel; Jehovah’s faithful witnesses]: and they [Jehovah’s witnesses] shall do in Edom according to mine anger, and according to my fury; and they [the Edomites] shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord God.” (Ezek. 25:14) In further corroborative proof see verse 18 of Obadiah’s prophecy. It is the Edomites, the religionists, and particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, that now make war upon Jehovah’s witnesses, and this they do under the command of the field marshal of Satan. Jehovah’s witnesses must fight with the sword of the spirit, that is, the Word of God, firmly and boldly declaring the truth which exposes and uncovers the hiding place of the lies of the modern Edomites.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>81</sup> We should expect the Devil to use every subtle means at his command to lull God’s anointed ones to sleep and to cause them to eease their fighting; but the true and faithful will not be deceived and lulled to sleep, Jesus says that the Devil and his agents “shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect”. (Mark 13: 22; .Matt. 2-1: 24) To seduce means to turn one away from the right path into the way of Satan the evil one, and doing violence to God’s people. The Devil would use some now to induce Jehovah’s witnesses to believe that they should slack up their work and not expect to do anything particularly important until after Armageddon. To influence or induce one to take such a course is seducing or turning one aside from the rignt way. But the Lord shows that it is not possible to deceive the very elect. (Matt. 24: 24) Those who are fully devoted to the Lord will refuse to be influenced or seduced by such efforts to keep them quiet. They will be on the alert at all times and resent any and all subtle influence of the Devil, which may appear to be put forward by him through any creature, whether that creature claims to be consecrated to the Lord or not. God has commanded his people to “rise up against her in battle” now. By his prophet Ezekiel he commands his anointed ones, “the man clothed with linen”, saying, “Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubims; . . . And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight. And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims, and took thereof, and put it [fire] into the hands of him that ■was clothed with linen; who took it, and -went out.” —Ezek. 10:6,2,7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>32</sup> Such work by the anointed is doing the ‘slaying’ part of the Elisha work, which he was anointed to perform. The Lord graciously revealed this matter and caused it to be published in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font4"> Book One, page 116 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ci scq.,</span><span class="font4"> and that no doubt for the instruction and guidance of his anointed, that they might be fully equipped and furnished for all good work. Yet it appears that some who should have learned what is published, and should be performing these duties as God has commanded, instead have been seduced, and by some wrongful influence, and are interfering with the work and endeavoring to make the anointed believe that their chief work is to be done after Armageddon. The elect will not be deceived or seduced. These faithful anointed ones will not slack the hand in this day of war, but with the zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house they will continue to press the battle against the enemy. The remnant will not engage in the destructive work at Armageddon. The part performed by the remnant is to proclaim the message by the Lord as he has commissioned and commanded them to do. The Lord Jesus Christ and his heavenly host will do the slaughter work. That is made clear by many prophetic statements.—2 Chron. 20:16-22; Ezek. 9:4-6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>33</sup> The remnant have a work to do now before the destructive work of Armageddon begins, and which work they must complete before that destructive work docs begin. (Matt. 24:14, 21) From the time Jehovah put his name upon his anointed ones, giving to them the “new name”, he commissioned and sent them forth to perform their part by declaring the day of his vengeance. As they go forth to the nations bearing testimony to the name of Jehovah, the Most High says to them: “Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.”—Isa. 62: 2, 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>34</sup> Jehovah exhibits his anointed witnesses before the Esau crowd and thus shows his favor to his ■witnesses; and because he puts his favor upon them the fire of the enemy is drawn against Jehovah’s witnesses and the battle goes on. The enemies of God, particularly the religionists, are designated under the name of “Esau”, “Edom,” “Ephraim,” “Philistines,” etc. All such refer to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their allies. Concerning such enemies Jehovah says: “Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine!” (Isa. 28:1) The enemy, the religionists, are drunken with satanic wine; and such, in their maudlin, drunken state, go forth, making war against the remnant because the remnant “keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ’’. These faithful ones bring the truth to the people, and the truth uncovers the hidden lies of the religionists. The battle is on, and to his anointed, faithful, true witnesses Jehovah now says: “In that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue [the remnant] of his people.” (Isa. 28:5) Jehovah thus shows he is on the side of these faithful witnesses.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>83</sup> Can there be any doubt in the mind of any of the truly anointed temple class that the battle is now on between the religionists and Jehovah’s faithful servants? Ilas not that battle been raging, and with increasing fury, during the past ten years? The Boman Catholic Hierarchy trains all its guns upon the witnesses of Jehovah. In Germany that wicked “old whore” has bluffed and browbeaten some into silence, but there yet remain in that sorrowful land many humble, true and faithful witnesses who are determined to give the testimony as commanded, even if it costs them every drop of their blood. In New Jersey the enemy, led by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, has brought up every available instrument with which to assault and beat down Jehovah’s witnesses, but in that section the true and faithful remain firm and continue to sing louder and louder the praises of Jehovah, pressing on in the battle. They count not their earthly existence dear unto them. Moved by the unbreakable love of God and Christ, which is stronger than de ith, those faithful ones, in the language employed by Paul, now say concerning the v.ar against them: “Rut none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.”—Acts 20: 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>30</sup> The wicked Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allies use all their power and influence to cause the radio stations to cease broadcasting God's message of truth. They have employed ail manner of political methods to have laws enacted to suppress the truth. They use their newspapers to publish malicious libels against, God’s faithful and true witnesses. They carry forward their mischievous persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses, causing rules or laws to be made commanding that even the little children be compelled to submit to their senseless, religious ceremonies of saluting flags, thus attributing to a thing salvation rather than attributing to God salvation, to whom it belongs. They denounce everyone who attempts to set forth the Scriptural reasons showing that it is the duty of the follower of Christ Jesus to obey God and no<sup>1</sup> man. The purpose of the enemy is to turn Jehovah’s witnesses and all sympathizers away from God by putting them in fear and subjection, and to control them in an arbitrary, inquisitorial manner by dictators, and to destroy the freedom and worship of the true, almighty God. Shall anyone who loves God have anything to do or anything in common with such workers of iniquity? (Ps. 94:20) Would anyone who loves God co-operate with that wicked crowd by trying to induce the anointed to believe that the chief part of their work will be accomplished after Armageddon, and that they should now go easy? Could anyone who is devoted to God and to his cause, and who is participating in the fight, now' put forth or attempt to put a scotch block under the wheels of God's organization by saying in the presence and healing of the anointed words to this effect: “We are getting nowhere now. Our chief work is after the first phase of Armageddon. Wait till then. We will then be ready to receive the great multitude.” Those who now yield to such sophistry and fall under that influence will be seduced and deceived, and that of itself shows that such cannot be of God’s elect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3T</sup> What is the purpose of the battle now in progress between 1he religionists and Jehovah’s witnesses? Certainly not to convert 1hc world nor to gather the groat multitude; but it is to furnish the opportunity to those persons of good will toward God to hear the message of truth and to take their stand on the side of God and his kingdom and to truly “seek righteousness” and “seek meekness” before the tierce anger of the Lord is expressed at Armageddon. (Zeph. 2:1-3) Jehovah has not commanded his witnesses to gather the great multitude now or at any other time. That ■work the Lord himself does in his own good time and way. For anvone to say “Our work of gathering the great multitude will take place after Aimageddon” is presumptuousness before the Lord. The business and work of the anointed is to obey God's commandments. He has commanded that this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached and completed before the slaying work begins. The Greater .Moses, Christ Jesus, sends forth his followers from the temple and commands them to proclaim boldly from the housetops (he message of the kingdom and the day of the vengeance of our God. To refrain from so doing or to slack the hand and become negligent, or to attempt to exercise influence over the anointed to cause them to become negligent and slack the hand, const illites a failure to give heed to the commandments of Jehovah’s great Prophet.—Acts 3: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>38</sup> Is the Lord Jesus at the temple of Jehovah? All the evidence shows that he is. That being so, then Christ Jesus is conducting judgment and “before him [are] gathered all nations”, and he is separating them. Mark the words of the scripture which says that it is Christ Jesus that is separating the nations and determining who are the sheep, the Jonadabs, or great multitude. Christ is gathering them, and not we. If the gathering of the great multitude takes place after Armageddon, then when could it be po'-'mble for those people of good will to show favor to Christ and Ins persecuted remnant as the members of his body as stated at Matthew 25? At Armageddon the persecution will be done, because the persecutors will be slam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those of the great multitude must be firm and bold in doing their work by informing others and thus giving them the opportunity to seek righteousness and meekness before Armageddon, because such is the plain word of the Lord. If one does not see that the Loid is now at the temple, conducting judgment, then surely that person is not of the temple. If, while mingling with the temple class, continuing to claim to be one of them, a person utters speech or exercises influence to induce the anointed to be negligent, such is an offense against God and against his organization.—Matt. 18:6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>88</sup> Let the anointed now hear and give heed to the words of Jehovah, who says: “Rise up against her [Satan’s organization, the Edomites] in battle.” The battle is on now, and is growing in severity each day. Amidst this great persecution by the enemy the work of proclaiming the kingdom message must go on to the end that the ‘hidden lies’ of the enemy may be uncovered and fully exposed Io view in order that those who love what is right may flee to the city of refuge, which is God’s organization, and remain steadfastly there until the wrath of God is past. Today the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their allied clergy have departed entirely from the Word of God and his service and have devoted themselves to the political affairs of the forces of darkness. Their allies heretofore called “Protestants” are dead, and now ‘darkness covers the whole world, and gross darkness is upon all the religionists’. Yet in that organization, and under its dominating control, there are those v.ho sigh and cry for light ami truth. To the remnant, his faithful anointed ones, Jehovah now says: “Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.” (Isa. 60:1, 2) You who have been brought into the organization of Jehovah, let your light now so shine that all with whom you come in contact may have cause to know that you arc for Jehovah and his kingdom, first, last, and all the time.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark7"></a>SATANIC PREPARATION FOR ARMAGEDDON</span></h1>
<p><span class="font8">A</span><span class="font4">T ONE time in the history of .Satan’s wicked organization of angels and men ancient Assyria was the outstanding and dominant world power. The city of Nineveh was its capital at that time. The ruling factors of that world power resided there and exercised dominion therefrom. Hence Nineveh, and also Assyria, of which it was the capital, are used in the Bible prophecies to represent Satan’s organization as it exists in our day, particularly the political side of the earthly part of the Devil’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the prophecy of Nahum, which is addressed to Nineveh, Jehovah describes his own organization as being prepared for the great and impending conflict, the battle of Armageddon, and serves warning notices on Satan’s organization today, saying: “He that dash-eth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily. For the Lord [Jehovah] hath turned away the excellency . . . The shield of his mighty men [that is, Christ and his armies in heaven] is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches [or, flash with steel] in the day of his preparation [Jehovah’s preparation], and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.”—Nahum 2:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In keeping with his usual mode of procedure, Satan the enemy prepares for war, and he does so with great noise and boasting and at the same time keeps the peoples in ignorance of his purpose. Christ Jesus, God’s great Prophet, caused the apostle John to make a record of this prophecy, namely: ‘‘And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.”—Rev. 1G: 13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The three unclean spirits here mentioned are likened unto frogs. A frog swells up, is bombastic, and boasts of what he is going to do and makes much noise about it. The noise of a bullfrog strikes terror to the mind of one who does not know whence the noise emanates. The Devil has the whole world in fear and distress because his bullfrogs are bellowing forth their noise. The ‘‘dragon” mentioned in the above-quoted text represents the entire satanic organization, while the ‘‘beast” is symbolic of the visible part of that organization, and the ‘‘false prophet” particularly represents the great political mouthpiece and spokesman which all observant people today can plainly see is the joint power of the British Empire and the United States. With one accord all these elements of Satan’s organization boast and make much noise of what they arc doing and are going to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In substance they say: ‘The earth is ours, and we are going to fix everything to our liking; and when we get through the people will like it.’ This is but voicing the sentiment of the Devil, who is symbolized by the dragon in the river, as described by the prophet Ezekiel (29: 3), and which says: ‘‘My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself.” Here the river is symbolic of the peoples on whom Satan has hold. The visible part of the Devil’s organization makes peace pacts and boldly announces: ‘We have outlawed war and hence there will be no more war, and let the people be assured to that end.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the Paris Peace Pact was pending before the United States Senate for ratification, its chief sponsor in America was prancing about like a well-groomed horse that wanted to show itself. Even moving pictures were made of his antics, and these were exhibited before the people throughout the land. At the same time the war organization was pushing the lawmaking body both for the ratification of the peace pact and for more battleships. The political whip was brought to bear to carry out the purposes of those in power, this being symbolically described in Nahum’s prophecy (3:2) in these words: ‘‘The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the prancing horses, and of the jumping chariots. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Within a few days after the United States Senate ratified the Paris Peace Paet by an almost unanimous vote, the lawmaking machinery provided for the building of a more powerful navy than has ever before been had, and provided for the expenditure of $275,000,000 for new war vessels, to say nothing about the great expenditure for other military preparations. Public press dispatches, dated February 13, 1929, announced that the president signed a bill that day to authorize the construction of fifteen modern warships, and within a few minutes thereafter the building program was begun. The clergy and the religious leaders loudly applaud the action of the political and commercial powers, and say to the people, in substance: ‘There will be no more war, because wo have outlawed war. At the same time we must prepare by building more ships.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is rather difficult for the common people to understand the consistency of such actions and declarations. The building of war machines proceeds upon a gigantic scale in every nation of so-called ‘‘Christendom”. The political factors, in the saddle, make the legal provision ; the commercial giants arrange for the money; and the clcriry provide the sanctimonious smoke screen which their ‘‘father” (whom .Jesus declared to be the Devil) employs to blind the people Io the truth. Just as the prophet says, all three are like bullfrogs; but the loudest one, and the most sanctimonious among the three, is the clergy of the great ‘‘false prophet” system, Britain and America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The preparation goes on and Satan causes his agents, the rulers of the earth, to take counsel together against God and against his Anointed, and to say, in substance: ‘Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us, and fix the world to suit ourselves.’ To this Psalm 2:4 replies: ‘‘He [Jehovah] that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh ; the Lord shall have them in derision.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Returning now to the consideration of Nahum’s prophecy relative to the preparation, it is found to be exactly in accord with the prophecy of Revelation, above quoted. Jehovah speaks through Nahum and says: ‘‘The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the bio.id ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings. ’’—Nah. 2: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The chariots mentioned in this last-quoted verse arc not the same chariots as those mentioned in the immediately preceding verse, which declares that ‘‘the chariots shall be with flaming torches [or, shall fl rJi with steel] in the day of his preparation”. Thc-e chariots flashing with steel are shown to be </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">out.ii'la </span><span class="font4">of the city (that is. outside of the Devil’s organization) and are preparing to lay siege to the Dexil's organization. The chariots mentioned in t'.e next verse, as ‘raging in the streets and justling one against another’, are in the streets or roadways </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">inside</span><span class="font4"> of the city, and are therefore a part of and belong to the city which is the Devil’s organization. These chariots last mentioned are therefore the military organization and machinery of Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Hebrew word translated “rage” in verse four of the prophecy is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">hallal,</span><span class="font4"> and means “to praise or to boast”, and is also rendered by the expression “to show oneself foolish”, (Young’s </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Concordance)</span><span class="font4"> Thus the “chariots” of Satan’s organization that “rage in the streets” are the military preparations that are vainglorious and carried on in a boastful manner; and those who are doing it swell up and bellow like bullfrogs making a great noise, while praising their own greatness, and thereby seek to impress the people by appearing in the streets and exhibiting themselves. Why all the noise in the public press and upon the screens of the moving pictures concerning war preparations? Why the great military and naval display at every national function? Why the exhibition at every moving-picture show of some politician or warrior who is preparing for war? It is the war organizations and war lords raging in the streets and making themselves foolish. Why, in all the war preparations, at the canteens, in the art galleries, in the public press and in the moving pb-turcs, is the religious element made so prominent? It is always a part of the same bombastic campaign that Satan himself is engineering, and he is blinding the men who are really engaged in it and using them as his dupes. These fraudulently say: ‘We are Christian, and w'e therefore represent “Christendom”.’ But be it noted that they do not praise God nor his King, but they praise themselves. They are hurrying in their preparations and boast of their power and make themselves mad and foolish before the Lord. And the preparation goes on!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One translator renders the text in Nahum thus: “They [the chariots] rush along in the broadways.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Hath.)</span><span class="font4"> Thus they do, because among the people they can make better speed by boasting of their power and that they are ‘making the world safe for democracy’. Another translation renders the text thus: “They rush to and fro in the broad ways.” (A.Zf.F.) The thought of friction, as implied in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version, </span><span class="font4">which reads, “They shall justle one against another in the broad ways,” is entirely absent. By means of diplomacy they avoid friction, and thereby keep the real meaning hid from the eyes of the people. Such is always Satan’s method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then adds the prophet: “They shall seem [or, as the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">licviscd Version</span><span class="font4"> reads, The appearance of them is] like torches.” The word “torches” in this verse is more frequently translated “lamp”, and suggests the view that Satan’s organization-units, or his foremost agencies, will claim or appear to be as lamps, lighting 1he w’ay of the people, or like torches of liberty lighting the way for freedom and progress in the government of the people. It is the clergy that use their pulpits and the radio to harangue the people and to tell them of the great torches of liberty that the heroes are holding forth to light the people into a desirable condition. They are really blind guides and false prophets. God foretold exactly that the condition would exist which now does exist. “For such,” he says, “are false apostles [preachers and teachers], deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ [claiming to represent Christ, and hence being called ‘organized Christendom’, or ‘organized Christianity’]. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers [the clergy] also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.”—2 Cor. 11:13-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then adds the prophet Nahum, saying: “They shall run like the lightnings.” In other words, they are swift in the execution of their preparations, because Satan knows he has but a short time (Rev. 12:12), and the rulers are in distress and perplexity, because of what they see approaching.—Luke 21: 2G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God’s prophet proceeds, saying: “Tie shall recount his worthies </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">[gallants]</span><span class="font4"> : they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared.” (Nah. 2: 5) The word “worthies”, or gallants, in this text is in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">American llcvised Version</span><span class="font4"> rendered “nobles”. In other texts the same Hebrew word in the original is rendered “principal” (of the flock) (Jer. 25:3-1-36), and also “famous”. (Ps. 136:18) It is Satan's nobles or principal ones of the flock of the religious organization who are here meant, lie has them in mind and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">recounts</span><span class="font4"> them. He takes a census of his chief agencies, and measures the strength of his fighting force as well as of his bellowing “frogs”. Those men are of Satan’s world; lienee Satan gives consideration to them. —John 15:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those who carry out Satan’s purposes are his favored ones, hence called his “worthies”, or nobles or famous ones. This is one of his schemes to turn the people away from Jehovah God. Satan keeps before the people the great heroes of his organization. In the religious organizations, in the great political meetings, in meetings of the financiers, in all of these the importance of the principal men, as examples and heroes worthy of praise, is held before the people. The met ro-politan press, which is merely the tool or mouthpiece of Satan’s organization, publishes glowing accounts of the valor of the mighty officers of war, of the power and virtue of the financial giants, and of the greatness of the religious clement and religious leaders. It is a mutual admiration society; and the press and the radio, the moving pictures and the artist, arc all called into action to glorify the names of men, all of which keeps the minds of the people turned away from Jehovah God. This is all in harmony with what inspired prophecy foretold.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark9"></a>MANKIND’S SUFFERING: WHY PROLONGED</span></h1>
<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font4">ESUS CHRIST was put to death, and on the third day God raised him out of death. (1 Cor. 15:4) He had stated when on earth that God had given to him the great privilege of attaining unto inherent life, or immortality. (John 5: 26) When he was raised from the dead he was brought forth the express image of Jehovah, possessing immortality, and alive for evermore. (Heh. 1:3; Rev. 1:18) The resurrection of Christ Jesus as a divine creature is a guarantee that all his body members must be raised with His resurrection, to immortality. This is why the Christian is admonished to seek glory, honor and immortality, eternal life. (Rom. 2:7) Immortality is life in the highest condition, and indestructible. It is written: “For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every man in his own order; Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s, at his coming.’’ (1 Cor. 15: 22, 23) Christ Jesus was the first one resurrected; and his body members, or the church, are resurrected at his second coming; and they are resurrected to immortality, to an inheritance incorruptible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The apostle Paul wrote: “For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is cur life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.” (Col. 3:3,4) The argument here is that the one who is begotten by God’s spirit and brought forth as a spiritual son of God is dead as a human creature and that his right to life is hid with Christ Jesus, and that when Christ appears at his second coming then the resurrection takes place. Again it is written concerning the same ones: “Beloved, now are we the sons of God; and it doeth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.”—1 John 3 : 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is proof that members of the new creation while on earth do not know what their resurrection glory will be, but that they will be like Christ Jesus because they will be with him and see him as he is, and be members of God’s royal family of heaven. This is further corroborated by the statement of Revelation 20:6: “Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years. ”—Rev. 20:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Concerning the time of the resurrection, it is written: “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first.” (1 Thess. 4:16) This proves that the Christians who have died throughout the Christian era have not gone straight to heaven at death, but that they must remain dead until the second coming of our Lord; and then when he takes his power to reign, those faithful ones in Christ shall be raised first. The word “shout”, as used in this text, means a command of authority, which shows it has reference to the time when the Lord Jesus, as the great High Priest of Jehovah, takes authority and begins his reign.—Ps. 110: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God’s new creation complete will constitute the great royal priesthood of God, which priesthood was foreshadowed long ago by Melchizedek, who was both the king of ancient Salem and also “priest of the Host High God”, and who also blessed the patriarch Abraham after God had given him the victory over the enemies. (Gen. 14:18-20) Jesus the Head of the new creation is alone the “seed of Abraham”, and his body members of the new creation are made a part of such seed of Abraham by being adopted by Jehovah God, the Greater Abraham. In Christ Jesus the “Seed” all the families of the earth are to be blessed. (Gen. 12:3; 22:18) The new creation constitutes the crowning feature of all of God’s creation. It is that creation which is granted life and immortality, and shall be for ever to the glory of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">More than six thousand years have passed since Jehovah created the perfect man Adam, who failed. For more than two thousand year's God caused great living pictures to be enacted, foreshadowing the development of his new creation. For nearly two thousand years more he has been selecting and developing this new creation. In all this period of time the human race has suffered sickness, sorrow and death. Satan has taken advantage of the time, to endeavor to turn the minds of men away from Jehovah. Many professed Christians have asked, Why should there be so much suffering amongst the peoples of earth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“For we know,” says the apostle Paul, “that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. ” (Rom. 8:22) Not only is this statement of the divine record true, but every man can bear witness to the fact of human suffering. There is no human creature on the earth who is perfect, and none who has lived without suffering. From the cradle to the grave each one has experienced pain. Many have asked the reason why. The time is due for man to learn the reason why.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Death is a great enemy. That enemy has ravaged every home. The Devil has made the people believe that God is responsible for the death amongst the human race. On the contrary, death resulted by reason of sin, and sin entered the world because of man's disobedience to God’s righteous law. The Devil himself is the one who induced such disobedience. Alan willingly disobeyed God and heeded the enemy. When some loved member of a family dies those mourning the loss are often heard to say: “How can a just and loving God take away our beloved one?” When the people understand God’s purpose and the outworking thereof, such a question will not be asked. Then the people will not sorrow as those who have no hope. There can be no hope without knowledge; hence the necessity of knowing God’s truth that shows the way to life and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Could not God have made man so that he could not sin, and thereby have prevented so much suffering? Of course, God, being all-powerful, could have made a creature and called him man and made him so that it would have been impossible for him to sin. The fact that he did not do so is of itself proof that he had a good and sufficient reason for not so doing. The record is that God made man in his own image and likeness. That means that man was endowed with wisdom, justice, love and power. It was meant that man should use these faculties; otherwise God would not have endowed him therewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God created man with a body, mind, will and affections; and he desired man to use all the faculties with which he is endowed. To use his will would mean that man must determine to do or not to do that which was presented to him. Man was informed that to obey God is good, that to disobey him is sin and results in death. Since man was possessed with will power, it follows, then, that Adam must choose to do good or evil, and take the consequences. Suppose God had created him so that he could not choose evil, but was compelled to do good; then he would have been merely a machine, with no freedom of intelligent action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God created man perfect and created him for His own pleasure. (Rev. 4:11) God takes no pleasure in wicked things. (Ps. 5: 4) Neither does God compel any creature to do good, His purpose is that happiness ami life shall result to those who do good, and suffering and death to those who do evil. Had God made man so that he could not commit evil, that would have been equivalent to compelling him to do good. Compulsory obedience docs not bring real happiness to the Creator or to the creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God is love, and is therefore the perfect expression of unselfishness. He desires his intelligent creatures to love him and to serve him because of love for him. Such could not be the result unless the service is voluntary. Jian must be like God in order to be happy; which means he must be unselfish. Why, then, did God punish disobedience, if he is unselfish? Because God is good; and everything opposed to him is wicked; and he who refuses to obey God allies himself with wickedness, which brings unhappiness both </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font4"> himself and to the Creator. Love, or unselfishness, means looking out for the welfare of others, and had God refused to punish disobedience it would have been to the detriment and not for the good of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If God should exercise his power to compel man to obey, then he would be inconsistent; and it is impossible for Goel to be inconsistent. Why would he be inconsistent? Because to compel man to obey him would be selfish; and God cannot be selfish, because he is the complete expression of unselfishness. He desires his creatures to be like unto himself, to wit, prompted by love or unselfishness. He docs not exercise his power to compel obedience, but he exercises his power to punish disobedience for the good of the one who disobeys. The creature who loves the Creator and who loves him supremely will obey him. For this reason his rule is announced by Jesus, his beloved Son, thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“He that hath my commandments, and kcepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father’s which sent me. ’ ’— John 14: 21, 23, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the same reason it is written: “Love is the fulfilling of the law.’’ (Rom. 13:10) That means that he who is prompted by unselfishness in his devotion to God, and who obeys for that reason, meets every requirement of God’s law. Had Adam exercised love toward God he would have obeyed him. Adam was selfish and desired to serve himself. Uis wife was a part of himself, and for selfish reasons he wanted to be with her; hence he disobeyed God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah never has done anything contrary to love, and never will. He gave this commandment to the Israelites: “And thou shalt love the Lord Ihy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.’’ (Deut. 6: 5) Some may ask: Was not this a rule compelling the Israelites to love him, and was it not prompted by selfishness on the part of Jehovah? No! The Israelites were then imperfect. God was their true and only Friend. Obedience to his commandments meant life to them. They could obey only if they loved Jehovah; therefore Jehovah gave commandment, not because of selfishness on his part, but for the good and well-being of the Israelites. This announces the unchangeable rule of Jehovah that he who would enjoy life and happiness must love the Lord Jehovah with all his heart, mind, and soul or person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To be completely happy man must exercise his own will freely, and always be prompted in so exercising it by love or unselfishness. Experience bears out that if he is prompted by selfishness and does wrong, he suffers. If he is prompted by unselfishness and does right, he is blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There may have been many reasons why God did not make man so that he could not sin, and why he has permitted wickedness to have sway over such a long period of time; but it is certain that there are at least three good and sufficient reasons which appear, and these are: First, to prove that he can put creatures on this earth who, under conditions of temptation and stress, will maintain complete integrity and dexotion toward him ; second, to afford ample time for the selection and development of the new creation, through whom wickedness is to be eradicated and the blessings of life and happiness brought to the people in due time; and, third, to afford ample time for Satan the Devil to remain and go his limit m wickedness to try to turn all men away from Jehovah God, before God manifests liis power over Satan and his organization. This period of time has also allowed for the birth of a sufficient number of human creatures to fill and enjoy the earth when'the kingdom of God is established over the earth and God’s name is vindicated and all the obedient ones of the human race are lifted to perfection on a perfected earth.</span></p>
