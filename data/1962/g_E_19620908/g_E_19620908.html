<h1><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font26" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>WHY take it</span></h1>
<div><img src="g_E_19620908_files/g_E_19620908-3.png" alt="" style="width:189pt;height:51pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">wrpAKE it easy!” is A a very common expression. In fact, so common is it that even bums and others who hardly ever raise a finger to work bid each other adieu with an encouragement to take it easy. Rut why take it easy when life is by far more enjoyable and healthier when the body and mind are vigorously active?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The late English historian Robin G. Collingwood said that he believed that great happiness could come from “the knowledge that one is free to go on doing, day by day, the best work one can do.&quot; Former Supreme Court Chief Justice of the United States Charles E. Hughes declared: “I believe in work, hard work and long hours of work. Men do not break down from overwork, but from worry and dissipation.” So why take it easy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Today Americans over sixty-five years of age are retiring at the rate of 3,000 a day. However, over four million of these have not stopped but have gone on working. They have learned that vitality and ability are not entirely governed by age. Work holds rewards for them. Of this, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Science Digest,</span><span class="font17"> April, 1960, had this to say: For those “who get most of their satisfaction and practically all of their sense of worth out of their occupations, retirement is a trying experience. Work for these people has </span><span class="font17" style="text-decoration:underline;">\</span><span class="font17"> been a fulfillment of the need for social participation. It has provided ... a chance to achieve or be creative, or a chance to be of service to others.” So these persons want to go on .working. They do not want to take it easy, nor should they for their health’s sake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Loafing on the job or elsewhere may suit some people, but it does not suit those who are accustomed to responsibility or the stimulation of work. They enjoy doing things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Annually untold work hours are lost simply because both men and women take it easy when they should be working. They look upon work as a curse, an enemy— no't a friend. It is also true that most of these clock watchers and loafers seldom, if ever, get enjoyment out of their work, mainly because they refuse to give of themselves and put their heart into their work. Therefore, they miss not only the joy of exhilarating exercise, but also the thrill of accomplishment. The happiness that comes from a job well done is never theirs. What they usually reap are long hours and days that drag on, because of their lack of enthusiasm for work. So why take it easy? Throw yourself into your work and enjoy it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Admittedly, some employers are not the best sort of persons in the world to work for, but that does not justify loafing, holding back and taking it easy. Your halfhearted service not only makes your employer miserable but you as well. What is more, you reap the effects of his irritation. Thus you heap trouble on your own head by taking it easy. So why do yourself injury? Work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">By turning to the Bible we can learn there the proper attitude that man should have toward his work. The apostle Paul admonishes Christian workers: “Do not loiter at your business. Be aglow with the spirit.’’ “Whatever you are doing, work at it whole-souled as to Jehovah, and not to men, for you know that it is from Jehovah you will receive the due reward of the inheritance.” (Rom. 12:11; Col. 3:23, 24) No taking it easy for Christians, but whole-souled work! In turn, this has a wholesome effect on all concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">People who love life crave activity. And </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">faithful servants of God were</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">are such </span><span class="font17">people. Take for example Noah. He reared a family, became a preacher of righteousness and built an ark after he was five hundred years old! Abram was seventy-five when he left Haran to take up a whole new life in Canaan. Moses at eighty became leader of the children of Israel. Caleb at eighty-five said of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">himself:</span><span class="font17"> “I am today as strong as on the day of Moses’ sending me out. As my power was then, so my power is now for the war, both to go out and to come in.” (Josh. 14:7-11) Paul, after many years of full-time ministry, told the Thessalonians about “working night and day,” so as not to put an expensive burden upon any one of them. (1 Thess. 2:9) And at Revelation 7:15 we read of those who come out of the “great tribulation” rendering God “sacred service day and night in his temple.” Nowhere in the Bible do we read anything favorable about one that says, “Take it easy!” Industriousness, not slothfulness or idleness, is what is praised. So, then, why take it easy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Since life is not without purpose and time is precious, we should do well to take stock of how We spend our time. Not to waste time takes planning. For leisure or free time operates on the principle of the vacuum; as soon as it is created, something has to move in. To have something worthwhile move in, plan your evenings and weekends. Instead of being a viewer, become a doer, and you will be happier for it. Some may build their own garage. They plant their own flowers and lawn. Others create toys for their children and repair </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">their own ear. Energetic housewives,</span><span class="font17"> instead of cooking the same dishes over and over again, enjoy planning new dishes. They may set the table differently, rearrange the furniture or sew their own wardrobe. They know that the most rewarding use of'time is not taking it easy, but using it well. This calls for attention, not only to the home, but to the spiritual welfare of those who live in it as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Free time may provide an escape from secular work, but never let it be an escape from God and your responsibility to God. Use free time to cultivate the mind and renew the spirit. Schedule time for good reading, especially the Holy Scriptures. Set aside time for reflection, meditation and contemplation. Also, there is so much good to be reaped by carrying the lifegiving message of God’s kingdom to people of goodwill. Buy out time for this. Use your time wisely to grow spiritually, for from within you will draw great satisfaction and happiness. So why take it easy when there is so much good to do and so much pleasure in doing it?</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">telligent Creator are the order, design and wisdom so evident in it. Your brain and spinal cord, for example, are so masterfully designed that the most complex circuitry in man-made computers appears crude in comparison. When a surgeon uncovers the spinal cord, he looks at an impressive sight. Remarking about this, Dr. Joseph P. Evans, a professor of neurosurgery, said; “There is also a fine tracery of blood vessels that is beautiful to behold. But overshadowing everything, is the great order apparent in all this. If one reflects how orderly this is, and how much more elaborate is the brain, whose secrets are even more deeply hidden than those of the spinal cord, the reality of great order is almost overwhelming.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">What do you know about the One who designed this complex spinal cord? What do you know about the One who made your remarkable body so that all its complex parts function smoothly as a united whole?

Do you think of this Creator as being the God that all people worship no matter what their religion may be? If you do, you do not know your Creator.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Many Goda</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">Throughout the world men direct worshipful devotion to a vast number of gods. Some are animals, birds,</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;"><img src="g_E_19620908_files/g_E_19620908-6.png" alt="" style="width:124pt;height:71pt;">

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">reptiles and other things of creation. Still others are idols made by the hands nt men. To imagine that this worship goes indirectly to man’s Creator is a misconception that is just as great as the thought that such things are gods worthy of worship. Your Creator rightly expects you to worship him rather than the things he has created or the things made by the hands of men. That he requires exclusive devotion is made evident in the second of the Ten Commandments he gave to the nation of Israel: “You must not make for yourself a carved image or a form like anything that is in the heavens above or that is on the earth underneath or that is in the waters under the earth. You must not bow down to them nor be induced to serve them, because I Jehovah your God am a God </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">ex</span><span class="font17">acting exclusive devotion.”—Ex. 20:4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The repeated warnings that the true God gave to that nation about not going after other gods confirm the fact that not all reiigious worship goes indirectly to him. He cannot be represented by an image of a human or a beast and worshiped through such representations, as was pointed out by the apostle Paul: “Although asserting they were wise, they became foolish and turned the glory of the incorruptible God into something, like the image of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed creatures ana creeping things. Therefore God, in keeping with the desires of their hearts, gave them up to uncleanness, that their bodies might be dishonored among them, even those who exchanged the truth of God for the lie and venerated and rendered sacred service to the creation rather than the One who created, who is blessed forever.” —Rom. 1:22-25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If you profess to be a Christian, do you give your Creator exclusive </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">devotion or </span><span class="font17">do you venerate created things such as living and dead humans? Do you venerate religious objects made by the hands of men? Do not imagine that such worship is acceptable to the Creator. If you think it is, you do not know him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Do you make the gaining of money of greater importance in your life than godly devotion? Is your chief concern the finding of pleasure? Do you adulate science? If you do, such things become your gods. These are the gods you worship although you may be a regular church attender and profess to be a Christian. This was admitted by Presbyterian </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">clergyman</span><span class="font17"> William S. Meyer, who said: “We worship other gods, made by our own hands, such as science, education, progress, money, power, prosperity, pleasure, reason, success, dividends and investments. We should ask ourselves this question, ‘In what do I place most deeply my soul’s reliance?’ ” Persons who worship such things, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">whether </span><span class="font17">knowingly or unknowingly, manifest ignorance of their Creator although they may be good church members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">By becoming a part of this corrupt world and venerating the things that it honors and holds in high esteem, a person unwittingly renders devotion to the chief adversary of the Creator. That enemy of righteousness is identified as the god of this world by the apostle Paul. “The god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, that the illumination of the glorious good news about the Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine through.” (2 Cor. 4:4) No wonder this world brings forth the Devil’s wicked fruits! No wonder James says that whosoever “wants to be a friend of the world is constituting himself an enemy of God.” (Jas. 4:4) Are you certain that you are not unknowingly worshiping or serving the wicked god of this world?</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>The True God</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">If you think that your Creator is a trinity of three gods in one, you do not really know him. The trinitarian Hindu view of three gods in one—Brahma, Vishnu and Siva—is not the accurate view of the true God. Neither is Christendom’s trinity. The true God stands alone as a single Being Without equal. “Is it not one father that all of us have? Is it not one God that has created us?” (Mal. 2:10) Jesus Christ viewed the Creator properly as One who is superior to all living creatures, including himself. He said: “The Father is greater than I am.” (John 14:28) This majestic Being who, as Creator, is the source of all life is the One whom Jesus Christ worshiped as his God. “I am ascending to my Father and your Father and to my God and your God.” (John 20:17) He appreciated the need for accurate knowledge about God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">only by taking in accurate knowledge</span><span class="font17"> of the true God from his written Word that you are able to get the proper view of this One who sent Jesus Christ to the earth. “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (John 17:3) As one who is sent, Jesus recognized his inferiority to the one supreme Being. Pointing out this Christian view of the Creator, the apostle Paul said: “There is actually to us one God the Father, out of whom all things are, and we for him; and there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things are, and we through him.”—1 Cor. 8:6.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Not Nameless</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">Regarding the name of the Creator Canadian clergyman G. Stanley Russell said: “The name that people give to God is also unimportant. He is not. likely to listen to their prayers less carefully because they address him as ‘Allah,’ or even, like the North American Indians, as ‘Manitou.’ ” If this is your view, you do not know your Creator. He has made it evident in the Scriptures that he is particularly interested in being identified by name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">As the true God, his name is set apart from those of all other gods, and that exclusive name distinguishes him from those gods. Jesus acknowledged this when he opened his model prayer by saying: ‘'Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.”—Matt. 6:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The importance that the Creator places upon his distinguishing name is made evident repeatedly in the Hebrew Scriptures. To the nation of Israel, who brought reproach upon his name by going after other gods, he said: “I shall certainly sanctify my great name, which was being profaned among the nations, which you profaned in the midst of them; and the nations will have to know that I am Jehovah.”—Ezek. 36:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The name “Jehovah” distinguishes your Creator from all the things that men venerate as gods. He is the Most High, to whom all worship rightly belongs. This is what people must come to know: &quot;That you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” (Ps. 83:18) If you know your Creator you will know his name and will direct your worship to him by that name and net imagine that this can be done by the name of some other god.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Purposes</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">Do you know what Jehovah’s purposes are? How can you be acquainted with your Creator if you do not? Acquaintance with his purposes is essential to being acquainted with him, for those purposes reveal his characteristics. They show that he is loving, long-suffering with man, kind and forgiving. They reflect his unmatched wisdom, his immense power, his love for righteousness and his great sense of justice. To really know him, it is essential to know what he has purposed for this earth and for man as well as what he requires of you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Three of his purposes that should be of the greatest interest to you are the vindicating of his name of the reproaches heaped upon it by this world, the establishing of righteous rule over mankind by means of his kingdom and the redeeming of obedient humans by means of Christ’s sacrifice so they may have eternal life. Having knowledge about these purposes gives you a better understanding of your Creator and increased appreciation for him. Such knowledge should create a burning desire to do what he requires of his worshipers. His requirements are set down in his written Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Study the Scriptures and take in the knowledge that will make you acquainted with Jehovah, the true God. Through his written Word come to know the One who is the Designer of your wondrously-made body. Learn the marvelous things Jehovah has purposed for those who love him and who worship him in the manner he wants to be worshiped.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">not limited co animals. No, the wanton slaughter of animals by thrill-seeking hunters is but one aspect of this slaughter in the woods. Each year, worldwide, thousands of persons are shot in hunting accidents. The situation is serious enough that many local authorities have sponsored safety training campaigns to reduce the slaughter of hunters themselves. Though the greater number of hunting accidents are not fatal, many hunters are seriously injured. In the United States about 1,500 persons are shot each year; of these about 300 persons die from their wounds. Of the several hundred persons hit last year in Canada, eighty-seven died. About 20 percent of all gun mishaps are fatal. The death rate in rifle accidents is almost double that with shotguns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">What accounts for most of the accidents? About 70 percent of them result from careless or trigger-happy hunters, some of whom shoot at whatever makes a noise. They foolishly make what they call “sound shots,&quot; not really knowing whether the target is a horse, a cow, game on which the season is open, game on which the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">season is closed</span><span class="font17"> or even another hunter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Some of these hunters fire away at first glance of something that moves, and then they take a longer look afterward. In the</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Big Horn Mountains of the United</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">States a hunter shot a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">buck deer and</span><span class="font17"> was bending over the carcass. This hunter was wearing a red coat and a red hat. How could another hunter mistake that scene for live game? Yet it happened; another hunter only a couple hundred yards away viewed the scene and immediately opened fire. The shot hit the man right in the hip pocket. He probably would have been another fatal casualty of the slaughter in the woods had it not been for the fact that he had a box of brass cartridges in that very pocket, which stopped the bullet. But the hunter did not escape without reminders of the near tragedy, since he was cut with fragments of brass and was speckled with smokeless powder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A smaller number of hunting accidents, about 30 percent, are self-inflicted. Teenagers account for a higher percentage of casualties resulting from unintentional discharge of a gun. These self-inflicted wounds result from all manner of carelessness. A gun discharges because it toppies over from some insecure prop. Though there are widespread laws against carrying a loaded rifle or shotgun in an automobile, accidents occur every year because of this folly. Despite warnings about crossing fences with loaded guns, many hunters are wounded while fence-crossing. Some accidents are hard to imagine. Can you imagine anyone being so foolhardy as to use a loaded rifle as a cane with the hand over the muzzle? It happens. Each year numerous persons lose various parts of their anatomies, mostly Angers, because of holding guns by their muzzles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Anyone doing hunting with firearms should be well familiar with the vital rules. Foremost, of course, is the rule to shoot only when the game is clearly visible. The value of this rule is obvious. Its observance would eliminate many hunting accidents. It would eliminate shooting at a noise, which “noise” might turn out to he another hunter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Hunting accidents do not just happen— they are caused, almost all of them, by the failure of some to respect the simple principles of hunting safety. One of those principles is never to trust a safety lock. One hunter thought it was safe to keep a loaded gun in his car as long as the safety lock was on. But one day he saw some game, rushed for the gun, and in his eagerness accidentally released the safety lock, causing the gun to discharge. The result was a hole in his car, but it could easily have been worse. Another good rule is never to hand a loaded gun to another person. Never take a loaded gun into a car, tent or house. “Empty” guns kill scores of persons every year throughout the world.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Wanton Slaughter tor Fun</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The</span><span class="font17"> wanton slaughter of animal life was recently spotlighted by Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, at a dinner of the World Wildlife Fund in New York city. After telling how Noah brought animals into the ark to save them from the flood, he said: &quot;Today a different kind of deluge threatens the earth’s creatures,” the flood of “thoughtless actions of mankind.” The prince noted that in 2,000 years about a Hundred species of animals and a hundred species of birds had become extinct. He spoke of the famous passenger pigeons that once darkened skies in North America and yet were exterminated in end generation, and “for fun.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The fun seeker, the thrill seeker, the status seeker and the trophy seeker— these have all multiplied the slaughter in the woods. For these hunters it is not a matter of food. It is a matter of testing their skill, of having fun or of getting prestige. One noted hunter has said: “I like this shooting thing, stalking some relatively large anirpal or, even more enjoyable, shooting birds. It's like the pleasure of hitting a ball.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Each year thousands of birds are slaughtered for fun. Telling what happened near the Swiss-German border, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font17"> magazine of February 2, 1962, reported fifty hunters closing in for the kill of a flock of plump, brown-black </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Belchen</span><span class="font17"> (coots) that were paddling across Lake Constance:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">'The few </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Belchen</span><span class="font15"> that tried to escape were blasted out of the sky or cut down before they could finish their flailing, loonlike takeoff. The rest of the birds were slaughtered where they sat. ... At least 600 Belchen. were bagged within the two-hour legal hunting limit, for a few bloodthirsty hunters were still dissatisfied. Groused one: ‘There’s no fun unless you shoot lots of them.’... The duckbilled, chicken-bodied coots that the gunmen slaughter . . . are worthless as trophies, and dead birds are usually given to the nearest garbage collector. . . . Still, more than 7,000 are shot each year. Explains one enthusiastic hunter: ‘They aren’t good for anything, and there’s lots of them. So why not shoot them?' ’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">How evident that the motive of these hunters is the mer<sub>e</sub> thrill of shooting the birds’ Other hunters seek to experience this thrill by shooting whatever they can find, especially larger animals. A reporter for the Fairbanks </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News-Miner</span><span class="font17"> tells of what went on a few years ago during a caribou hunt in Alaska:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“Perhaps 30 or 40 hunters in cars, or sitting on the ground with binoculars yell and keep firing at the caribou. The frightened herd runs this way and that to escape. Down go several big bulls and dainty cows. Some struggle to rise and fall back on broken bones. The white moss is stained scarlet with blood. Several caribou are very dead, most of them gut shot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“One hunter rushes up, cuts off a head and yells ‘look at these antlers.’ He doesn’t dean the animal. He has the trophy. . . . [The hunters] were out to kill anything that ’moved. Oftentimes it didn't have to move. High-powered gluts with telescopic lens cracked. Bullets whizzed far and wide. . . . One young woman was deliberately firing into the milling herd [of caribou] with a .22 automatic. She was shaking and screaming. ‘I never had so much fun in my life,' she said. Two men brought out a machine gun. Fortunately the game wardens were able to take the gun away before tragedy struck.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“Not only were caribou and moose shot down relentlessly, but small animals near the highway were shot just for fun. By the roadside we saw a mother porcupine and two babies all shot. Marmots, gay little rabbits, timid grouse, all met the same fate. A little mother . . . duck, a Victim of a hunter’s whim, lay dead beside the road. We saw the duck’s mate return again and again to the dead female uttering mournful cries, bereft of its loved one.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">What was the motive of many of these hunters? Was It food or was it thrills? What about the man whose sole purpose was trophies? the woman who screamed ecstatically as she pumped bullets into the herd of caribou? the men who came with a machine gun? Were they there for food or “fun”? Such accounts of wanton slaughter could be multiplied </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">ad nauseam,</span><span class="font17"> indicating that many persons take up the slaughter of animal life for thrills. As one writer has said: “Make no mistake, the pursuit of wild food induces a primitive and pleasing glandular disturbance, remotely akin to falling in love or winning a fist fight.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Christian View of Hunting</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">How is the Christian to view this slaughter in the woods? Can he participate in hunting without displeasing God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The Christian must take the Bible view. Hence he does not oppose the killing of animals for the purpose of food. He knows that after the great Flood God said: “Every moving animal that is alive may serve as food for you. As in the Case of green vegetation, I do give it all to you. Only flesh with its soul—its blood—you must not eat.”—Gen. 9:3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But what If a Christian does not need to hunt or can obtain all the food he requires without hunting? Would it be wrong for him to hunt? Not necessarily. Some kinds of food are not readily available at meat markets or other stores. If a person likes venison and is willing to pay the cost for obtaining it by hunting, there is nothing wrong in that. That God-fearing man Jacob had a taste for venison. Once he told his son Esau: &quot;Take, please, your implements, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt some venison for me. Then make me a tasty dish such as I am fond of and bring it to me and, ah, let me eat.” (Gen. 27:3, 4) The only way many persons can obtain certain dishes today, Buch as Venison, rabbit and pheasant, is by hunting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Where, then, could a Christian err in regard to hunting? By going hunting really for the purpose of thrills or for trophies rather than for food. One might salve his conscience and say to himself: ‘Well, I’m really going hunting for the thrill of the chase and the shooting, but what I kill I will take home and eat, so that will make it all right.* But does it? Is it safe for a Christian to cultivate such desires? God gave animals to man and they can be killed for food. BUt killing animals just to test human skills or to give men “kicks&quot; -and thrills is not the proper motive. Each Christian should remember he is preparing for life in God's new world, where thrillseeking Nimrods will not exist. Hence each Christian must examine his own mofives in regard to hunting. If he really wants the food and that is his true motive, then there is nothing sculpturally wrong. The fact that the hunter enjoys being out In the ©pen, breathing the fresh air, and that he may get relaxation out of hunting does not make it Wrong anymore than it would for a fisherman who seeks not only good food but the sunshine, the fresh air and relaxation. A fisherman too could have the wrong motive. If he fishes merely to test his skill against the fish, to haul fish in for fun and have a big thrill out of catching impressive specimens, he is not cultivating the right desires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">So the Christian who desires to please God could not join in wanton slaughter of animals, reveling in the thrill of shooting living creatures. Nimrod displeased God; he was “almighty hunter in opposition to Jehovah.’’ (Gen. 10:9) He hunted wild animals for thrills, prestige and self-glory; his cultivating such things led to his becoming a hunter of men. He cultivated wrong desires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">God gave man dominion over the animal creation, but man was not to chase and terrify the animals. He was to associate with them and delight in their presence. God made exceptions, in that animals could be killed for food, for sacrificial purposes or for clothing. Also, animals that injured humans or destroyed man’s domestic animals or property could be killed.—Ex. 21: 28; Cant.2:15.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Hunting Attire, Rules and Laws</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">If a Christian wishes to obtain food by hunting, what about attire? There is nothing objectionable about wearing a hunting costume, say a red cap and a red coat. Such attire is largely for safety and does not transform one into a thrill-seeking Nimrod, Whflt counts Is the hunter’s motive. Killing animals for the purpose of sport ©r amusement does not have the approval Of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Any Christian who obtains food by hunting should take all necessary precautions and obey all rules governing hunting. If one finds himself trigger-happy, shooting at mere noises, and so forth, one’s motive should be carefully examined, A Christian seeking food would shoot only when the game is clearly visible. He would not risk injuring or killing his fellowman by carelessness. Moreover, he would observe Caesar’s regulations governing the taking of game. He would not be guilty of killing more than the daily legal limit. Fishermen are said to violate daily bag limits more frequently than do individual hunters; but Christians will obey such regulations as the authorities in the community lay down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Not only are there human laws to consider, but the Christian who goes hunting for food will be most careful to obey God’s law on blood, which requires taking the precaution to bleed the animal property, since a bullet wound is not enough to effect adequate drainage of blood.—Lev. 17:13, 14; Acts 15:28, 29; 21:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Let all who go hunting clearly understand their motive, especially since “the heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate.” (Jer. 17:9) If any find themselves cultivating wrong desires, it would be better to refrain from hunting. Let no Christian be responsible for the wanton slaughter in the woods, the shooting that also claims many human lives.</span></p>

<p><span class="font25">S</span><span class="font17">INCE the article “Spain Sup</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">presses Religious Freedom” appeared in the April 8 issue of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font17"> there have been literally thousands of letters that have come to our attention in answer to your protests against the trampling underfoot of religious freedom on the part of the Spanish government. Over five hundred of these letters were written by United States senators and almost four hundred by congressmen and State representatives. British and 'Canadian government officials likewise responded, and clergymen, lawyers and school officials have added their voice in protest. No doubt you would enjoy knowing what some of these had to say. Herein are excerpts from a few of the letters received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“The suppression of religious freedom in Spain is an old, well-known and sad story.” —A newspaper editor in chief, London, England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“I am unalterably opposed to all sorts of restraints upon the minds of men by whomever and wherever imposed and you may be sure that I will be ready to do anything I can in advancing the cause of religious freedom.”—An attorney, Memphis, Tennessee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&quot;Publicity concerning these areas of repression is a valuable public service.”—Professor of law, Newport, Rhode Island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">From members of the Canadian House of Commons came these expressions: “I am shocked. . . . Freedom of religion is very far from any conception of the Spanish people. You may remember that that was the state that was responsible for the viciousness of</span></p><img src="g_E_19620908_files/g_E_19620908-9.png" alt="" style="width:192pt;height:142pt;">
<p><span class="font17">the Spanish Inquisition and, under a dictatorship, the people have not come very far since that time.” “I am appalled at what appears to be taking place in Spain today.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">From the British House of Commons: “Probably, publicity which is given by such articles is the best means of combatting this intolerance.” </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font17"> will most certainly make a protest on your behalf.” “You can rest assured the British Ambassador is behind you in this issue.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“I agree with you that the persecution taking place in Spain is to be deplored and resisted vigorously by outgo vernment.”—Member of the United States Congress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“Suppression of religious freedom anywhere is to be deplored. If we supply foreign aid to any nation, it seems to me that our government has a perfect right to insist upon religious freedom.” —Member of the United States Congress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“As a general rule, the United States Government has no basis for any official protest or action against the suppression of religious practices by another sovereign nation. But In the case of Spain, we have large numbers of American forces stationed there at the American air bases, and therefore we have every right to ask that they be accorded the rights and privileges of American citizens,”—United States senator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">However, the United Stateff*State Department has taken another view of matters. It excuses pressure from the Catholic Church, and explains that, regardless of what the Spanish government may be doing to freedom, they would rather have Franco in their camp than lose his support in the fight against communism. Having made inquiry on the matter, a congressman made these remarks: “The Catholic Church plays a fairly large part in the functions of the Spanish Government, and there is a natural tendency to thwart any attempt on the part of other religious groups to proselytize. It was also explained to me by a State Department official, that our Government hesitates in condemning the Spanish Government for the reason that it is a non-Communist country, and there is no desire to lose the support of this country in our struggle with Russia. The United States has a number of air bases strategically located in Spain, and in order to insure their retention, all caution is used to avoid any possibility that they will not be retained.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Of course, not everyone agrees that that is the best policy. “I am not entirely satisfied with the reply of the [State] Department,” said one senator. “Frankly, I feel that the reply of the Department leaves something to be desired.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“It is a lamentable fact that, in times of peril like these, we must necessarily ally ourselves with all those who will oppose our common enemy, even though our allies may themselves be unsavory.” “The use of our foreign aid money to keep a despot in power in a country seems most objectionable to the ideals on which this country was built and presently advocates.” —Members of U.S, Congress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“There is, of course, a growing feeling in many circles that we are making a great mistake in sendin’g our dollars to support dictators. I share this view.” —United States senator.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Spanish Authorities Remark</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">What did Spanish officials have to say?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“There is no ban forbidding anyone to change his religion,” answered the Spanish embassy in London. “This is established by the ‘Fuero de los Espanoles’ or Spaniards’ Charter (Article 6), which states that ‘nobody shall be molested for his religious beliefs nor in the private practice of his form of worship.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“In Spain there is complete freedom of worship. —The Consulate of Spain, Los Angeles, Calif.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But the on-the-scenes report published in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font17"> which cited names, dates and places where persons have been jailed simply for admitting that they were Jehovah’s witnesses or for reading the Bible together in their private homes, belies their replies.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Religious Leaders Speak Up</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">There are ministers of many religious organizations who are concerned about the suppression of freedom in Spain, and they too voiced their views:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“I have tried to help some of our missionaries in Spain the past 15 years who have undergone as cruel treatment as what is described in your magazine.&quot;—Pastor, Presbyterian Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“I was in Madrid three years ago, and was able to observe first hand the difficulties faced by several religious faiths as they endeavored to worship.”—State director, Baptist Convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“This is the same story we get from most of the countries where the Catholics are dominant. And this certainly does bring concern to all God-loving people.” —Bishop, Brethren in Christ Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“We are on your side of the fence.” —Chairman, Bahai.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“We are greatly concerned about the suppression of religious freedom that is taking place in many countries including Spain. . . . We realize that this threat is coming ever closer to America as well as the world.”—Pastor, Evangelistic Center.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“We behold you as among God’s victorious.”—Minister, Unity Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&quot;I share your alarm.”—Minister, First Presbyterian Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“I am thoroughly convinced that unless something is done in the next few years, the Roman Catholics will take the world.” —Minister, Church of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“America stands in the gravest danger of its whole history. Not only from Communism, but also from Roman Catholicism and from a third sinister element, namely, an apostate Protestantism.”—Minister, Baptist Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“If your group is suppressed by Spain and/or the Catholic Church, that means that every other religious group in the world is in danger of suppression.”—Minister, Trinity Methodist Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&quot;Above all I think it is important that American people be informed as to the kind of tyranny, both religious, political, and otherwise that exists there, and I think your magazine is doing a real service.”—Rector, Christ Episcopal Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“It cannot be denied that such suppression does exist.”—Minister, First Methodist Church.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Roman Catholic Comments</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">Response from the Catholic clergy, however, was somewhat different: “As far as actual persecution is concerned I found no evidence or 11 in Spain.”—Roman Catholic priest, Portland, Oregon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“Objective evidence does not support any of your claims.”—Roman Catholic priest, Sioux City, Iowa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“Too bad there is no official suppression of J.W.’s in this country!”—Priest, Lancashire, England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&quot;We might not want a man like Franco for our country, but they are very much satisfied with him” in Spain.—Roman Catholic pastor, Durand, Wisconsin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“You have the effrontery to call on Catholic priests to voice a protest to our Government and to the holy Father against an official [Franco] who has dared to speak the truth of history.”—Roman Catholic priest, Pennsylvania.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“Never mind this religious freedom business. No man has the right to propagate error and heresy. . . . Anyhow, in Spain there is an ideal situation* existing between Church and State. And if you among others are not careful, you are going to arouse the sentiment of the rightthinking American people against you— possibly leading to the suppression of what you call religious freedom in this country. The more you and Protestants advocate Birth control—the greater the chances of this Nation some day becoming a Catholic country. That will be the day. Then maybe what is going on in Spain might be compared to a Sunday school social.”—Roman Catholic pastor, Livonia, Louisiana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But far greater in number are those persons who want to be free to hear what others have to say and choose for themselves. They speak out on behalf of freedom, not only for themselves, but for all men. They are of the opinion that safeguarding freedom for others is a good way to preserve it for oneself.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By “Awake!” correspondent in Finland</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15">IATURDAY, June. 9, was a memorable day in the history of Jehovah’s witnesses in I Finland, On that evening 1,543 Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">from all parts of the country gathered at Tikku-ri la, near the capital city of Helsinki, to attend the dedication of a new branch office, home and factory, which had been built by the united efforts of the Witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">An architect who is a Witness designed the new structure; and in September, 1961, the Witnesses began to dig the foundations, the work going ahead quickly. Working very hard and willingly, this force of Witnesses contributed 12,000 hours of work. Finally the new partly three-storied, red-brick Bethel home and factory, situated on a large rock mass overlooking the beautiful countryside, came to completion,</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font15">dedication program included a review of the work of Jehovah's witnesses in Finland. It all began in the summer of 1909, when a Finnish businessman set out to make a pilgrimage to Palestine, Because of travel connections he was obliged to wait over in Gothenburg, Sweden. There a colporteur, as the full-time preachers of Jehovah's witnesses were then called, happened to call at the hotel in which he was staying. In room-to-room work the Witness met this businessman, who accepted some books and began to read them as a means of passing time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font15">Bible explanations that these books contained were so revolutionary to this man that he abandoned his trip to Palestine and returned to Finland. There he began a systematic study of the Bible with one of his friends, using the Society’s series of books known as “Studies in the Scriptures.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">These </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">two </span><span class="font15">men saw the need of preaching these Bible truths to others. A depot was needed, and in 1911 a small room was rented. On Sunday a public talk was usually presented in a nearby park and interested ones were invited to the office, where study meetings were held. By the end of the year there were five dedicated workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The following year, 1912, the first convention was arranged, in connection with the Memorial of Christ’s death, with thirty-six persons In attendance. At the end of this year the first </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font15"> appeared in Finnish. That same year the Society’s first president, C. T. Russell, visited Helsinki, and 140 persons attended a convention in connection with his visit. The next year, 1913, a branch office was opened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">By </span><span class="font15">1928 there were 305 Witnesses in the country. Some of these considered </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">the possi</span><span class="font15">bility of going to serve where the need was still greater, in Estonia. The Estonian radio, in 1930, unexpectedly agreed to broadcast the Kingdom message over the Tallinn radio station in </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Fin</span><span class="font15">nish, Swedish, Estonian </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font15">Russian. </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font15">broadcasts were continued without interruption </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font15">five years. Since the Estonians proved </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">to be </span><span class="font15">very receptive to the Kingdom message, many Witnesses went across from Finland to work there as full-time preachers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">When Finland entered the second world war, there were about 500 Witnesses in the country. During the war the Branch servant was arrested, literature confiscated and the magazines banned. Yet the Witnesses pressed on, and when the war came to an end, there were 1,420 publishers in Finland, an increase through those troublesome years of 185 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Since 1945, the Kingdom work has moved forward, so that in April 1962, there was a new peak of 8,939 Kingdom ministers in Finland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">In his dedication discourse Branch servant Erkki Kaiikaanpaa discussed this growth and showed the need for the expanded facilities, In 1938, for example, 73,313 </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font15"> and </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font15"> magazines were printed in Finland, but last year more than two million were needed. Further, the Kingdom Ministry School for overseers is now being held in the new building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Jehovah’s witnesses in Finland are determined to make full use of these expanded facilities to do all in their power to carry the message of God’s kingdom to all corners of the land.</span></p>

<p><span class="font25">A</span><span class="font17">LL too familiar to many ocean trav- , elers is the sickening feeling that r comes when a ship encounters heavy I seas. As the ship goes up and down, rolling at the same time to the right and to the left, a passenger’s stomach seems to rise into his throat and then drop into his shoes. The walls of his cabin seem to swim about his head. He breaks out into a cold sweat and takes on a greenish pallor. Wave after wave of nausea sweeps over him. He retches until his insides feel as if they are tearing apart. Feeling violently ill, he loses interest in everything about him, including life itself. The torment of motion sickness transforms what could have been a delightful trip into a nightmare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A traveler flying in a plane high above the ship passenger might feel like congratulating himself for not being on the rough ocean below and prostrated with seasickness. But when his plane encounters turbulent air, he may not feel so selfsatisfied. As the plane is tossed about, dropping suddenly like an elevator and rising just as suddenly, he feels the same sickening up-and-down pressure on his stomach that the traveler on the ocean liner feels. A feeling of nausea can come over him and grow worse as the plane banks suddenly. The cabin seems to spin about him. Before long he frantically reaches for the special paper bag kept in the seat pocket in front of him. Airsickness can be every bit as unpleasant as seasickness. Whether on the ocean or in the air, the traveler can be made miserably ill by motion, but people to it.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Sensitivity fo Motion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">Some persons are so sensitive to motion that they get sick when riding in a train or a car or even when sitting in a swing. Others may not be affected until they begin reading while they are moving. Still others can get sick when sitting still in a movie house watching a motion picture taken from a plane or a roller coaster. Motion sickness can be triggered by what the eyes see as well as by what the body feels. For some unknown reason it affects women more than men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Women travelers are five to ten times more sensitive to motion sickness than are adult males. This is especially true with airsickness. Half-grown children have about the same sensitiveness, whereas children under two years of age do not appear to be affected at all. Young men between the ages of seventeen and nineteen seem to be three times as sensitive to it as males over thirty years of age. This does rjot mean that adult males do not succumb to motion sickness; they do, but not as readily as other persons. In fact, 90 to 100 percent of all people are subject to some form of this sickness. Immunity to one form does not necessarily mean immunity to other forms of it.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Cause</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">There is uncertainty as to what actually causes motion sickness. Those who think it is psychosomatic are faced with vehement denials by persons who have suffered it. The use of sugar-pill placebos has not stopped people from, getting sick. In one test on military fliers 20 percent of those taking sugar-pill placebos got sick. While there are instances of people becoming sick because they thought they would, evidence points to something more than imagination as the cause. The cause appears to lie in the central nervous system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The nerves of the eyes, nose and internal organs contribute to the squeamish feeling associated with the various forms of motion sickness. The principal contributors appear to be the nerves associated with a person's sense of balance. These are connected with the labyrinth in each ear where semicircular canals filled with fluid play a major role in the mechanism of balance. Confirming the relation of motion sickness with the labyrinth is the fact that persons whose ear labyrinths do not function never suffer motion sickness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Some motions of a plane or ship are more distressing than others. Pitching and heaving movements, for example, are more likely to cause sickness than rolling movements. The same is true when the craft makes repeated moves in more than one direction. Motion in the walls, floor and ceiling of a cabin is especially sickening when the passenger is unable to orient himself by looking at a distant object through a window or porthole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">During World War II it was found that 80 percent of the airsickness suffered by bomber crews was among men in the navigators’ compartment. These men usually occupied compartments where they could not orient themselves by looking outside. When they went to another part of the plane where they could see the horizon or distant objects on the ground, they often felt improved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Other aggravating factors can be the reading of fine print in a moving vehicle, indigestion, too much alcohol, hunger, overeating, lack of ventilation, a cabin that is too warm, noise and vibration, the smell of food or engine fumes, and so forth. Just the sight of a person who is sick can make an uneasy feeling in the stomach become worse.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Prevention</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">Motion sickness is not necessarily inevitable for you when you travel. There are ways you can prevent it. On a plane, for example, be careful about choosing the location of your seat. Remember that a seat near the front or tail tends to have more motion than near the wings. Select a window seat on the right side near the wings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Seats on the left side of a plane are bad for sensitive persons. The plane usually banks to the left when it turns because the pilot sits on that side and can see better by banking in that direction. The ground dips and swirls past the eyes of the passengers on that side whenever the plane banks. This aggravates any feeling of nausea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Sitting next to a window has an advantage over sitting next to the aisle. It allows you to keep yourself oriented by permitting you to look out the window. When you look out fix your eyes on distant objects that appear to be fixed. These might be distant mountains, cloud formations or even the horizon. Avoid looking at the nearby landscape or clouds, allowing them to swim past your field of vision. That will make any tendency toward sickness much worse. Perhaps you have noticed this sickening effect from an automobile when telephone poles flashed by at a blurring speed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It is wise to avoid overeating before taking a trip. Food in itself will not cause motion sickness, but too much food ir the stomach can contribute to it. On the other hand, it is equally unwise to fast. An empty stomach can have just as bad an effect as a stomach that is too full. The best course to take is to eat the food you normally do, in a moderate amount. Start your trip with a comfortable stomach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If you feel a bit upset, recline your seat as much as you can and rest your head on the headrest. Keep it in one position. The fewer head movements you make the better off you will be. Oftentimes a feeling of nausea will pass away when the head is kept steady against a headrest. If the up-and-down motion of the plane makes your stomach feel as if it is sliding up and down inside of you, take a deep breath and hold it when the plane hits a downdraft. That will tend to compress your abdominal organs and reduce the feeling of movement. These suggestions will also prove helpful to passengers on an ocean liner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">When you begin to feel sick on a ship, get out of your cabin and go out on deck. Recline in a deck chair, keeping your head steady. Do not look at the moving deck and waves in the foreground. Fix your eyes on the distant horizon. Very likely this will cause the sick feeling to pass. In the event that you finally succumb to seasickness, you can figure on about three days of lessening misery before you become adjusted to the motion of the ship. After that you should be all right unless the sea becomes rougher. Only about 3 to 5 percent of the pass sr gers on ocean liners fail to make this adjustment.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Drugs</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">It was not until motion sickness incapacitated large numbers of fighting men during World War n that medical science began deep research on the problem. In 1943, Canadian researchers produced a drug that worked satisfactorily in preventing motion sickness. A few years later an antihistamine accidentally proved effective when it stopped carsickness in a patient who was being treated for something else. A number of drugs for motion sickness are now available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">As might be expected, the drugs have some bad side' effects. They sometimes cause blurred vision and drowsiness, .depending upon how much is taken. To be most effective in preventing motion sickness, it is necessary to begin taking one of these drugs from a half hour to one hour before you start your trip and then at specific intervals thereafter. Usually the effect of one pill will last for about four hours. When taken after you have become sick, it is less effective. Injections of sodium bicarbonate were discovered to be helpful by Dr. Minoru Muta of Japan. The injections can provide immunity for up to one month. This treatment, however, may not be available to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Whether you will use one of these drugs or try the less certain methods for preventing motion sickness is something you will have to decide for yourself. You know your own sensitivity to it. In any event, there is no reason to fear a delightful trip by train, ship or plane when ways exist for you to prevent motion sickness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WELCOMED BACK</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Jehovah’s witnesses recently used a high school for holding a Christian assembly. The school board had been somewhat reluctant to grant permission for use of the school facilities because they had been improperly cared for by other religious groups. The facilities included a cafeteria equipped with the latest machinery. What did the school officials say about the Witnesses’ use of the facilities? “This building is cleaner than it has been for eight years,” and, ‘‘If you ever want to use these facilities again, you are welcome.” The principal, impressed with the cafeteria organization, called his wife to come and see for herself. The county manager of cafeterias was likewise impressed with the cleanliness, so much so that he offered the head cook a job supervising one of the county school cafeterias. This Witness had come to serve where the need is great for Kingdom ministers and needed a job. The superintendent of the county school was so pleased with the report from the cafeteria manager and the principal that he welcomed the Witnesses to come 'back anytime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CLERGY OPPOSITION</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">In Mexia, Texas, the efforts of the clergy’s Ministerial Alliance to prevent Jehovah’s witnesses from holding an assembly in the city failed. Public reaction showed disapproval of the clergy’s action. Many businessmen remarked that they did not favor the efforts of the clergy. Almost every business place that had a window display accepted a sign advertising the public talk. Though the contract for the auditorium was rent free, there was to be a charge if It was necessary to turn on the heat for the three days. Saturday evening it got chilly and a man from the fire department came over, turned on the heat and said: “This is on the fire department. There will not be any charge for this service for you people.” The public lecture was broadcast over the local radio station, the manager being most cooperative. He said he did not like the way the clergy went about things, and he went on the air with an editorial stating that the Ministerial Alliance was out of place in trying to pressure the'clty commissioners into denying a minority group the freedom to assemble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">After the assembly, the Watchtower Society’s representatives in charge of the awem-bly were approached by one of the city commissioners. He stated tha&lt; he attended all the program Sunday and enjoyed it very much. He said that the conduct of the Witnesses in the city was very good and that he would certainly recommend to the city commissioners that they be invited back anytime. Attendance at the assembly was 10 percent over the total number of Witnesses in the area, indicating that many local people were present to hear the public talk, plus the many who listened to the broadcast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NATIONAL ASSEMBLY IN COLOMBIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Colombia's national assembly was set for March 23-25, 1962, in Barranquilla, and how the Christian witnesses of Jehovah appreciated the privilege of coming together! Some came from mountainous regions where they had to travel on foot or by horse or burro for great distances, then by bus, train or riverboat to the assembly city. Some buses filled with Witnesses traveled upward of thirty hours and over some roads that were thick with dust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">To provide for the arrival of the delegates a unique arrangement was made in some cases: A special busload of delegates would arrive. The rooming department had already made arrangements for the entire group to be assigned in the same section of town. So they would drive to the Kingdom Hall in that section, unload and then be guided to their rooms by local brothers. Some thirteen special buses were handled in this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Baptism, which had been a problem due to the distance from the beach, was handled easily: The brothers dug a small pool about ten feet long, four feet wide and five feet deep in the sandy patio of the branch office of the Society. They then lined this with less than $4 worth of plastic, and there the baptism of 179 persons was held.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">You may have wondered why the climate of England is mild, while Labrador, in the same latitude, has a climate that is far more rigorous. And why is it that Norway, located largely above 6CF latitude, has ice-free harbors into the Arctic Circle while Greenland and Siberia are so forbiddingly cold? How do you explain the fact that tiny Uruguay is famous for its beautiful Atlantic beaches, while Chile with nearly 3,000 miles of Pacific coastline has nothing to boast about in that regard?

Because of its identical summer and winter temperatures, the Kuroshio Current has been called the fraternal twin of the Gulf Stream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">From outer space astronaut John Glenn saw the Gulf Stream as “a river of blue.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">This current is fed by the north equatorial current that crosses the Atlantic and piles up water in the Gulf of Mexico. The high water level finds an outlet through the Straits of Florida, where it flows northward as the Gulf Stream with summer temperatures as high as 80° until cooled by northern water. probably would be icebound in winter. If warm Gulf Stream waters meander and fail to reach Norway there is a noticeable dearth of fish and the vegetable harvest is inferior. Thanks to the Gulf Stream, Norway’s year-round open harbors enable her to place among the four leading countries in merchant tonnage. Long before Benjamin Franklin charted part of this “river” by means of its color and temperature, Nantucket skippers were using it to speed their vessels toward Europe.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>The Humboldt Current</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">Coming up from the icy Antarctic is the influential Humboldt or Peru Current that flows from southern Chile up the coast to Peru, almost to Ecuador. Before reaching the Galapagos Islands it swerves westward across the Pacific. This frigid stream induces many ocean bathers to content themselves merely with sunbathing. While it is named after Alexander von Humboldt, the famous German biologist and naturalist, it cannot be said that he discovered it. In 1520 Fernando Magellan, the Portuguese navigator, on his round-the-world trip was startled to see the Indians traveling rapidly on their rafts and canoes while others nearer the shore moved at a more leisurely pace. In modern times the Humboldt Current has performed similar service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">On April 28, 1947, Thor Heyerdahl, a Norwegian adventurer, built a raft and embarked from Callao, Peru, with five companions to demonstrate his theory of how the Pacific Islands were originally populated. After many thr</span><span class="font17" style="text-decoration:underline;">illin</span><span class="font17">g experiences they arrived at the Marquesas Archipelago 4,000 miles away in the Pacific. Their raft, the Kou-Tiki, became famous through book and film. However, not everyone was convinced that the Peruvian Indians had populated the Pacific Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">To prove the opposite theory, Eric de Bisschop, another European adventurer, and four companions set out from the island of Tahiti ten years later on a similar craft. Bisschop’s crew made use of a warm current that drops down toward the Antarctic and completes the counterclockwise circuit of South Pacific currents. Beset by many difficulties, the voyagers finally had to be rescued by the Chilean navy about 200 miles south of Easter Island. Nevertheless, enough of the trip was accomplished to illustrate Bisschop’s theory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">You can take your pick of current theories as to who populated what. This much is certain, the effect of the Humboldt Current on the west coast of South America is very great. A notable result is the fabulous coastal fishing grounds. From the mineral-rich Audes the rivers of northern Chile carry many elements such as iron, copper, iodine, nitrates and phosphates down to the sea. There the Humboldt Current picks them up and carries them along. A great variety of minute plant and animal life called plankton draws on these elements for nutrition. The plankton, in turn, attracts some 200 varieties of fish, which, in turn, attract millions of sea birds. Man, of course, is attracted by the fisherman’s paradise. That explains why Chile, Peru and Ecuador have struggled so tenaciously to secure a two-hundred-mile sea limit for fishing rights, while the United States and other countries have been willing to accept a mere twelve-mile limit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In the arid northern section of Chile, where there are few inhabitants to eat the fish, little by little canning factories are springing up to preserve the fish for export. Neighboring Peru has built up a flourishing industry by transforming billions of tiny anchovies into fish meal pellets that are exported as livestock-poultry feed, “Guano,” the nitrogen-rich droppings of the guanay birds along the coastal islands, is also a big business for Peru, since she exports it as fertilizer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Occasionally these industries are sabotaged by the meandering of the Humboldt Current, as occurred in 1957-8, When the cool Humboldt drifts out to sea the temperature of the coastal waters rises. Down from the north comes “EH Nino,” a warm current with 68° water. Millions of fish and enormous quantities of plankton die. Some fish depart In search of cool water where plankton thrives. With the fish gone or dead, the guanay birds starve and abandon their fledglings. Soon the air along the coast is befouled by the odor of rotting fish and birds. Sulphurated hydrogen created by this condition blackens the paint on ships In harbor, giving them what is called a “Callao painting.” Temporarily ruined Is a fishing industry and a fertilizer business by the meandering of the Humboldt Current.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">At times this struggle between the tropical and frigid currents Is accompanied by thunderstorms and tropical rains that produce a miracle of life in the parched earth of Chile’s Atacama Desert. Within fifteen to twenty days after the heavy rain a carpet of beautiful flowers blankets the valley. Years may pass between one torrential rain and the next, but the seeds, bulbs and tubers wait below the surface for their opportunity. To botanists studying the phenomena me enduring vitality of the tiny seeds and roots is amazing.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>Hrttill and Benguela Currents</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">On the eastern side of South America conditions are just the reverse. The south equatorial (Brazil) current branches down the Atlantic coast south of Recife to maintain the humid heat of Brazil and nourish her fabulous fertility. As a special gift, the year-round temperature of the Copacabana Beach at Rio de Janeiro makes it one of the most enticing beaches to swimmers of many countries. There winter practically never exists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In the same latitude on the opposite side of the Atlantic the heat of southern Africa is tempered by the cold Benguela Current that flows up from the Antarctic to complete the circuit of moving water in the South Atlantic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Oceanographers have discovered that the superhighways of the sea are more complex than previously supposed. The old concept that ocean currents are “rivers” in the sea is undergoing modification. The frequent meanderings of the ocean highways show that they have no clearcut channel. There is also evidence that the Gulf Stream, for example, is not so much one stream as a series of currents interspersed with countercurrents. Along its route one current starts up, goes a distance and then expires. Meanwhile a short distance away a parallel current starts up and goes farther before running out. This overlapping of currents within the Gulf Stream has been called the “shingle effect.” It is ohe of the oddities of the sea that has aroused much curiosity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The discovery of mighty countercurrents running below the well-known ocean streams took oceanographers by surprise. In the Pacific the eastward moving Cromwell Current was found several hundred feet under the westward flowing south equatorial current. At still greater depths a third current was found moving westward again. Likewise tremendous countercurrents were found flowing southward beneath the Gulf Stream and the Humboldt Current. There is also evidence of an equatorial subsurface countercurrent. It is believed that these undercurrents are a principal means of maintaining earth’s heat balance and regulating our climate.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>Secret of Motion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">Several factors cause the ocean water to circulate. When water cools or the salt in it Is concentrated, its density becomes greater and it sinks below the light surface waters. In the Arctic and Antarctic frigid water drops to the ocean floor and slowly creeps toward the equator, where the water Wells up from below to make way for the continued influx from the poles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The chief cause of ocean circulation, however, is the winds produced by solar radiation. At the equator the hot sun causes the air to rise, creating a vacuum. Into this vacuum rushes air from the northeast and southeast, producing the steady trade winds so long used by ship captains. At the same time the fiery sun expands the equatorial waters, causing them to move. The steady winds propel this expanding water westward in currents that flow to the north and south of the equator. The revolving motion of the earth causes these currents to flow clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">This welling up of deep water combined with the circulating currents aerates the oceans with the oxygen that sustains sea life. That is why the superhighways of the sea have been called the ocean’s “lifeblood.” Reverent men see in this complicated interplay of sun, air, water and planetary motion a wisdom and power that far exceeds man’s. Scientists expect that it will take decades to unravel the many mysteries still buried in the deep.</span></p><img src="g_E_19620908_files/g_E_19620908-14.png" alt="" style="width:96pt;height:13pt;">
<p><span class="font15">HEN Dr. Albert Einstein granted an interview to a Japanese journalist named ____Takada, the famed scientist said: &quot;In the whole history of science the manufacture of the hydrogen bomb is the most appalling mistake the scientists have ever made.” But scientist Einstein had been disappointed long before the development of the hydrogen bomb. Telling about this, Fernand Gigon wrote in his book </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Formula for Death:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&quot;Einstein’s secretary has told us how the scientist progressively lost his faith in mankind as his strength waned. During the war, when he wrote to the U.S. Government that his calculations were such as to make an atomic bomb a possibility, and that he visualised the uses to which such a bomb could be put, he made one stipulation when offering his help. Once the first bomb was made and ready for trial, he said, representatives of Germany</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">offering many prayers for the repose of the soul, the speaker had taken the opportunity to focus attention on the God of all comfort. In a simple and straightforward manner an explanation was given to satisfy meditative minds as to the cause of death and the solid hope of a new world of righteousness where many dead ones would be restored to life. Attenders fearing horrible sufferings for the deceased were relieved with the Scriptural evidence that the dead are not in torments. The genuine hope of a resurrection impressed all hearers with the wondrous power of the Almighty and drew minds away from the God-dishonoring pagan concept of an immortal soul hovering about somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">At the conclusion of the short discourse given by one of Jehovah’s witnesses, no one blamed the merciful and long-suffering Creator for death. The talk had honored God as worthy of our worship and service, splendidly testifying to his loving will and purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The motive behind most funeral rites is not to bear witness to and honor God. Mystery and superstition as to where the dead are have led to various rites designed either to assist the deceased to a new abode, to secure his welfare, or to protect the living from the dead. The deceased and his “spirit” have been the all-important concern of such ceremonies, including the custom known as</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Waking” the Dead </span><span class="font17">From the pagan</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Celts of England “Christians’* there adopted the ancient custom of staying with the dead from death to burial, or keeping a “wake.” </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopaedia Britannica </span><span class="font17">states regarding this practice: “Doubtless it had a superstitious origin, the fear of evil spirits hurting or even removing the body. . . . With the introduction of Christianity the offering of prayer was added to the vigil. As a rule the corpse, with a plate of salt on its breast, was placed under the table, on which was liquor for the watchers. These private wakes soon tended to become drinking orgies. With the Reformation and the consequent disuse of prayers for the dead the custom of ‘waking’ became obsolete in England,-but survived in Ireland.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Customs equivalent to “waking” are still found among many peoples of the earth, including present-day inhabitants of West Africa. Among the latter the corpse is put in a casket, not under a table. It is not essentially the fear of &quot;spirits” that prompts members of Christendom to keep wakes. The reason generally put forth is that friends and relatives wish to share the grief of the family, and pay a last tribute to the deceased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Except among the Muslim Mandingos, who bury their dead very quickly, keeping wakes is the popular rule in West Africa and is seldom melancholy, especially if there is much to eat and drink. Because sympathizers are losing a night’s sleep in order to comfort the bereaved, it is incumbent on the family to provide refreshments. If the family is too poor to prepare food and provide drinks, then friends will make donations so that the wake will be a success. Coffee, biscuits and sandwiches may be served, but more important is the liquor, without which no wake can be a success. In fact, few, if any, will attend a wake if no liquor is provided. If nothing better can be procured, at least plenty of cane juice will be supplied by poorer families. At wakes people turn up who have hardly known the deceased, but who never miss an opportunity to drink at someone else’s expense.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Church Wakes</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">Wherever the wake may be kept, whether in a home or a church, religious hymns are sung over the body until daylight. If the wake is in a church the drinking is done at a nearby home, with groups alternating so that the church is never empty. Not all may imbibe intoxicating spirits at a church wake, but boisterousness is generally present among many who do partake. Actual fighting too is not uncommon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The West African regards it as highly important that a wake be kept over his dead body. Perhaps the individual may not receive any undue attention during his lifetime, but he wants to be sure that he is properly honored at his death. He desires to have as many prayers said and hymns sung over him as possible. The size of the wake also indicates the deceased’s social status, so that the thought of a wake-less demise horrifies him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">For these reasons belonging to a church is considered to be important, for church members are assured of a church wake if they have paid their dues. Jehovah’s witnesses, who do not adopt pagan customs and so do not keep wakes, are at times accused of not burying their dead. Those who wish to associate with them may be discouraged by remarks such as, “If you die, Jehovah’s witnesses will not do anything for you.” But the truth is that Jehovah’s witnesses conduct a dignified funeral service honoring God, and not man, and that is satisfying to those who seek to please God rather than pursuing personal glory.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font17"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Wakes </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">and the Supernatural</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">Wakes among the more civilized are mild affairs compared to what tribal peoples put on. At tribal wakes drummers, singers and dancers all compete in what turns out to be somewhat of a free-for-all. The din does not abate until the sun rises, yet, if there is sufficient liquor on hand, festivities may be carried on day and night for a week or more even though the body may be buried within two days. A great feast follows the burial, either immediately or after some weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">At some wakes a definite effort is made to communicate with supernatural powers. Fortune-telling by means of mirrors may be practiced. A plate containing “medicine,” perhaps in a horn, is placed under the corpse. Applying this “medicine” is thought to make one able to see visions. Some persons gash their lips and cheeks with razors and then apply “medicine” to heal the wounds, reminding one of the Baal worshipers in Elijah’s day who cut themselves in an effort to get a response from their god. Certain manifestations that do occur appear to be caused by the operation of occult powers. Incidentally, the wake is viewed as the appropriate time to make “confessions” to the corpse of secret matters withheld from the deceased during his lifetime. This doubtless is done to forestall any retribution from the spirit world.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>“Crossing the River”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">To prevent the deceased's “spirit&quot; from feeling slighted, music and dancers are provided in the same way as was done at the death of previously deceased family members. Another curious provision for keeping a wake, regarded as necessary by the Kisi tribe inhabiting Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, is the “joke-mate/' a friend of the deceased who will joke about his death and thus provide entertainment that is assumed to be pleasing to the &quot;spirit.” In a good humor now, the “spirit,” it is thought, is willing to “cross the river.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">This “river” crossing is part of the ceremony of the Kisis called &quot;scattering the grave.” If the deceased is a man, this will take place on the fourth day after his burial; three days in the case of a woman. During these days the dead are regarded as not yet having “crossed the river,” which supposedly separates the spirit realm from that of humankind. “Scattering” the grave means removing the earthen mound and dousing the grave with water, Thereupon a chicken is sacrificed, thus permitting the “spirit” to join his people in the other world. Failure to “scatter” the grave is thought to keep the “spirit” on this side of the “river,” where it would bring harm to the living.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>Christian View</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">A number of Christian principles are violated by such wake-keeping. Christians were instructed by the apostle Paul to “quit being fashioned after this system of things,” just as ancient Israel was warned not to adopt the religious customs of pagan nations. Accordingly, early Christians kept no wakes. There was no wake kept over the body of Jesus.—Rom. 12:2; Jer. 10:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">While it is a fine thing to visit those who are bereaved, to comfort them and to be of help in other ways, extended periods of mourning and all-night vigils are not appropriate among true Christians, who, because they have faith in God’s promise of a resurrection, do “not sorrow just, as the rest also do who have no hope.” —1 Thess. 4:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Rather than support functions that may turn out to be drinking orgies, Christians heed the advice of the apostle Paul: “As in the daytime let us walk decently, not in revelries and drunken bouts.” Tribal wakes often lead to excesses and fights, and are avoided by those who heed the Bible’s good counsel.—Rom. 13:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Nor does a Christian wish to entertain and pacify the “spirit” of a deceased person, knowing that man does not possess such an immortal Intelligent “spirit.” Such ideas of deathlessness are contrary to the Scriptural hope of the resurrection and engender an unwholesome fear of the dead, but they are part of wake-keeping. —Ezek. 18:4; Ps. 146:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In harmony with righteous principles, true Christians who devote their lives to honoring God do not at death want others to make them the object of honor. They do not want the occasion of their death to be attended by unchristian customs. Rather, they would prefer that Scriptural comfort be given to the bereaved and that honor go to the great Life-Restorer, Jehovah God.</span></p><img src="g_E_19620908_files/g_E_19620908-16.png" alt="" style="width:201pt;height:116pt;">
<p><span class="font25">M</span><span class="font17">UCH controversy revolves around the words of the apostle John at Revelation 7:4-8 and 14:1-5. There he writes that 144,000 sealed ones are bought from among mankind and taken to heaven. Some say the number is literal and reveals how many literal Jews are converted to Christ and called to heaven. Catholic and Protestant leaders declare that this number must be symbolic and advance several arguments to support their claim. Let us consider the various viewpoints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Does the number 144,000 refer to the literal number of natural Jews converted to Christ and taken to heaven along with untold numbers of other Christians? It should be noted that the list of names of the twelve tribes in Revelation 7:4-8 does not fully agree with the names of the twelve tribes of natural Israel. Dan is omitted and Manasseh is added. The Revelation account is not dealing with natural Israel; it is discussing spiritual Israel, and simply using natural Israel as an illustration. (Gal. 6:15, 16; Rom. 2:28, 29) These 144,000 spiritual Israelites are called not only from natural Jews, but from many nations, as Revelation 5:9, 10 indicates: “You are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals, because you were slaughtered and with your blood you bought persons for God out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and you made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God, and they will rule as kings over the earth.&quot; Those who are kings and priests with Christ, those who are with him on heavenly Mount Zion, are limited to 144,000 but they are taken from all nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Even before the Jewish family records were destroyed A.D. 70, Paul had declared: “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor freeman, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one person in union with Christ Jesus.” (Gal. 3:28) If John were identifying the literal Jews taken into the Kingdom, he would be violating the principle that there is neither Jew nor Greek identified as such after coming into union with Christ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Those who allege that 144,000 is a symbolic number point out that it appears in the Revelation, a book of signs and symbols. However, this argument is not conclusive, because the Revelation actually contains both literal and symbolic numbers. Whether a number is to be taken literally or symbolically depends upon its background and setting. Examples of literal numbers found in the Revelation are the twelve apostles and the thousand years of Christ’s reign. (Rev. 21:14; 20:2, 3, 6, 7) That the number 144,000 is literal is indicated by John’s contrasting it with a great crowd, “which no man was able to number.” (Rev. 7:9) The force of his contrast is lost if the 144,000 is symbolic and also is a crowd that no man can number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Some contend that if 144,000 Is taken literally, then to be consistent one must take the unreasonable view that these sealed ones are all males, since Revelation 14:4 declares: “These are the ones that did not defile themselves with women.” It is asserted that if the use of “women” is symbolic, then the use of “144,000” also must be symbolic. However, this argument lacks foundation. When the Revelation gives a literal number, what immediately follows it is not necessarily literal. For instance, Revelation 21:14 mentions “the twelve apostles of the Lamb.’* We automatically take the number twelve literally because we know there were twelve apostles. We cannot argue that the twelve must be symbolic just because the word “Lamb&quot; does not refer to a literal animal. In the same manner the literal 144,000 are spoken of as being with the symbolic “Lamb” on the symbolic “Mount Zion” and, symbolically speaking, not defiled with women.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Those who maintain that 144,000 is a symbolic number do not answer the question, Symbolic of what? Does it represent one hundred and forty-four million, for example ? Millions of churchgoers have been told that they are on different roads, all heading for heaven, regardless of conflicting creeds, religious wars, religious illiteracy and material preoccupation. But is it Scriptural to say that millions are traveling on many roads to heaven?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Jesus taught: “Go in through the narrow gate; because broad and spacious is the road leading off into destruction, and many are the ones going in through it; whereas narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">few</span><span class="font17"> are the ones finding it. Not everyone saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will.&quot; (Matt. 7:13, 14, 21) Doing the Father’s will requires diligent and regular Bible study to learn that will. (John 17:3) Heavenly fife is won only by proving faithful to that will, even to death. (Rev. 2:10) Because many would fail to endure, Jesus said: “There are many invited, but few chosen.” (Matt. 22:14) He left no doubt that relatively few are taken to heaven when he said; “Have no fear, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">little flock, </span><span class="font17">because your Father has approved of giving you the kingdom.&quot; More than 144,000 would not be “few” or a “little flock.” —Luke 12:32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Does this mean that only 144,000 are saved? Not at all. The Revelation contrasts the 144,000 heavenly heirs with “a great crowd, which no man was able to number, out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb.” (Rev. 7:9) Jesus indicated that such are not of his “little flock” when he said: “I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; those also I must bring, and they will listen to my voice, and they will become one flock, one shepherd.” (John 10:16) But does not their “standing before the throne&quot; mean that they are in heaven?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It is possible to stand before the throne without being in heaven. Matthew 25:31, 32 indicates that “all the nations” are gathered before Christ, who is seated on his glorious throne. That does not mean that the nations are in heaven. The “great crowd” have listened to Jesus’ voice through the preaching of the good news of God’s kingdom. (Matt. 24:14; Rev.l4:6,7) Obeying it in faith, “they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. That is why they are before the throne of God.” (Rev. 7:14, 15) Continuing faithfully to serve God and his kingdom under Christ, this great crowd will survive the war of Armageddon into God’s new world with prospects of everlasting life on a paradise earth. Reigning over them will be Christ the King and his 144,000 associate priests and kings.—Matt 6: 9, 10; 2 Pet. 3:13; Rev. 21:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We have seen that the number 144,000 does not refer to literal Jews or to millions of churchgoers supposedly taking broad parallel roads to heaven. Clear understanding of God’s provision of salvation for the “little flock&quot; and the “other sheep&quot; removes the temptation to say that the number 144,000 is symbolic. The Scriptural facts prove that it is a literal number referring to spiritual Israel.</span></p>

It was tolled </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">21 </span><span class="font15">times at 6:30 am during </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font15">week and at 7:45 am </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">on Sun</span><span class="font15">days. Injunction proceedings to restrain early-morning </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">ringing </span><span class="font15">of the bell were instituted, but when the case came up for </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">hearing it was revealed that the plaintiffs had agreed </span><span class="font15">to </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">withdraw their lawsuit because of a private settlement. It was agreed that the </span><span class="font15">bell’s volume </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">would be reduced </span><span class="font15">for early </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">hours, tolled three </span><span class="font15">times in</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">stead </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> 21, </span><span class="font15">and at </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">15 </span><span class="font15">minutes </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">later </span><span class="font15">than customary. In view of the wide publicity given this </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">incident, </span><span class="font15">the terms of settlement were read in open court, whereupon Mr. Justice Wood</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">house of </span><span class="font15">the Supreme Court expressed his gladness over </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">the private agreement </span><span class="font15">and </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">said: “I have </span><span class="font15">no doubt that, in </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">spite of </span><span class="font15">the fact that the tolls of the bell have been reduced from 21 to three, the congregation of the church will not suffer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Japanese Bible Publishing</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;$&gt; Last year the Japanese Bible Society published two million Bibles or parts of the Bible, to raise the total to more than 20 million that have been published in Japan since the second world war. Considering that less than one percent of the population professes Christianity, it indicates considerable interest in the Bible among non-Chrlstian Japanese.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Profit In Narcotics</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">«$&gt; On July 17 James Brown, considered by the Federal Bu</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">reau of </span><span class="font15">Narcotics as the “major narcotics operator in the Harlem area [New York] for the past five years,” was arrested. He was said to be the leader of fifteen narcotics sellers who served at least 300 Harlem addicts daily and grossed 92,000,000 a year. According to Assistant United States Attorney James B, White each of the peddlers sold a minimum of twenty packets of heroin a day at 920 each. He said that they received 25 percent of the take, which means they each made at least $100 a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">On the same day as Brown's arrest narcotics worth $1,350,-000 on the underground market were burned under the supervision of the police. They had been seized by detectives in raids in recent years. The drugs were unsuitable for legitimate medical purposes since they had passed through the hand* of numerous persons who had diluted them, thus making them of unknown quality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Smoking and Premature Birth</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;*&gt; Preliminary findings obtained from tests on more than 23,000 expectant mothers and 17,000 children reveal that among mothers who smoke there are more premature births than among non smokers. The United States Public Health Service said that the findings “confirm the results of previous studies which have shown a relationship between cigarette smoking during pregnancy and prematurity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">High Dive</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">On July 18 Miss Lois N. Frotten made a striking debut as a parachute jumper; she plunged 2,000 feet through the air and when her chute failed to open she plunged into Mystic Lake feet first. Finally, she emerged, frightened, but apparently not seriously injured. Later, she asked: “What did I do wrong?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Sunday School Lessons</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;§&gt; A </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">UPI</span><span class="font15"> dispatch from Little Rock, Arkansas, reports that after a five-block chase police sergeant Frank Moore caught a shoplifter. When he asked the thief the names of his two accomplices who got away, he asserted: “I don’t know their names. I just know them when I see them in Sunday School.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Honesty</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The Boston </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Record</span><span class="font15"> of July 3, 1962, reported on the decision two men had to make when they found a pouch containing $11,685 in cash and checks lying on the sidewalk. Unhesitatingly they took the </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">money to the police, rnay happened </span><span class="font15">to </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">arrive at the same time that Jim Cohen, manager&quot; of Robert Lawrende Clothing, Boston, was reporting the loss of the weekend receipts to the </span><span class="font15">police. </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">When </span><span class="font15">the </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">men refused to take a reward, Cohen made a </span><span class="font15">donation to their religious organization. The </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">men were </span><span class="font15">Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">More Cars Increase Danger</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">A pamphlet published by the British Road Federation said that in 1960 Britain had 36.1 vehicles of four wheels or more for every mile of Jjer 195,000 miles of roads. West Germany’s roads were the second most crowded, with 31.8 cars for every mile, followed by the Netherlands, Sweden and the United States. Such crowded road conditions present a hazard. Dr. L. G. Norman, chief medical officer of the London Transport Executive, indicated how much of a hazard when he wrote in a paper for the World Health Organization that more than 100,000 persons are killed every year in road accidents. In some countries, he said, the death toll exceeds the number that die from tuberculosis, polio, typhoid fever, diphtheria and diabetes put together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Working </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Girls and Marriage</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;&amp; In Italy the general procedure has been to dismiss a working girl from her job if she got married. Women have attacked this practice as “forced spinster hood” and “incitement to concubinage.” A typical working girl's lament was this: “The firm where I work has informed me that they will fire me if I get married. All right, then, since my wages are necessary, I am going to live with my fiance without getting married.&quot; In May it was reported that to cope with the problem a draft law was approved by the cabinet which provides that no girl may be dismissed for </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">getting married. As a safe</span><span class="font15">guard, the law was understood to stipulate that dismissal of a girl within a year of her marriage would be presumed to be because of it. It was said that the law was assured of clear passage through Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">High-Cost Penny</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">On June 28 at an auction of rare coins conducted by the </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">New </span><span class="font15">Netherlands Coin Company, a Long Island, New York, man paid $10,500 for </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">a 1799-</span><span class="font15">over-1798 United States cent. It was said to be the highest price ever paid for a coin of that denomination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">He Loved to Be Cut Up</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;$&gt; What most people dread Maurice Hatt loved—to go to hospitals to be operated on. In the past ten years he has bluffed his way into </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">100 </span><span class="font15">hospitals and faked symptoms so successfully that he received fourteen abdominal operations —all unnecessary.Now,ajudge pointed out, “he is in the type of hospital where they are unlikely to oblige him by operating unnecessarily.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">MUe-and-a-Half-Thlck Ice</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;$■ University of Wisconsin scientists, who recently have returned from Antarctica, reported that seismic measurements showed the ice at the South Pole to be 8,400 feet thick, and the ground level to be 600 feet below sea level. In previously unexplored Antarctica areas, extensive mountains were found to exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Beer-drinking Habits</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;&amp; A report by the British Brewers’ society in May gives an insight into the beer-drinking habits of people in various countries. Belgians are reported to like their beer more than anyone else, drinking 28.6 gallons a person each year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Next </span><span class="font15">follows </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Australia with </span><span class="font15">22.6 gallons, New Zealand and West Germany with 22.3 gallons, and Britain with 19.5. Farther down the list are Canadians, who consume </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">13.2 </span><span class="font15">gallons a person per </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">year, and </span><span class="font15">Americans with 12.5, the </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font15">port said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Toe Replaces Thumb</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;$&gt; Dr. Bromley Freeman, associate professor of plastic surgery at Baylor University, reported to the American Academy of Orthopedic </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Sur</span><span class="font15">geons in Chicago earlier </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">this </span><span class="font15">year concerning a Texas </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">child </span><span class="font15">who had the second toe of </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font15">right foot successfully transplanted to replace his lost thumb. The child, now </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">ten </span><span class="font15">years old, can grip a baseball bat, pick up pins, play the piano “and pinches so hard it hurts,” said Dr. Freeman. </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font15">new thumb bends, wiggles and rotates, but it still looks </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">like </span><span class="font15">a toe.</span></p>
