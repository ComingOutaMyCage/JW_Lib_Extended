<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">There</span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">MMNGCROUS </span><span class="font14">of the dry-rot in men is a tendency to lurk and lounge; to be at street corners without intelligible reason;,., to do nothing tangible but to have an intention of performing a number of tangible duties tomorrow or the day after.&quot; Another noted author, Francis</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="text-decoration:underline;">T</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">HER</span><span class="font14">E is sweet refreshment in the idle hours of a vacation or in the periods of rest after a day or week of work. Such periods of idleness from labors can be stimulating. But when idleness becomes a way of life, a daily thing, it ceases to be refreshing and becomes dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">There is danger to a community where young people have nothing to occupy their minds and hands. As they lounge about street comers or elsewhere day after day, their idle minds turn to mischief, seeking ways to fill with thrills the time that hangs heavy upon their hands. Some youngsters have the initiative to find constructive things to keep themselves busy, but many others lack that initiative. Idleness among youths cahjead to their becoming involved in acts of vandalism, rowdyism and crime. Then the community suffers. In countries such as Switzerland where youngsters must do their share of work in a family juvenile delinquency is not the problem that it is in countries where parents do not insist upon their children keeping busy with constructive work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The famous writer Charles Dickens once observed; “The first external revelations Quarles, said; “Idleness is the Dead Sea that swallows all the virtues and is the self-made sepulcher of a living man.&quot; Too many young people today have allowed idleness to swallow their virtues, causing them to descend into the pit of delinquency and crime. The mischief that results from their idleness can ruin their lives by burying whst could have been for them a bright future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Good cannot be expected to come from a perpetually idle mind. It is like a stagnant pool that breeds scum, disease and filth. Evil thoughts intrude upon the idle mind and are nourished there, building up wrong desires that eventually express themselves in bad actions. This can happen to adults as well as to children. Idleness is the breeding ground of trouble. It was one of the major factors contributing to the decay of the Roman Empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Under the decadent influence of indolent nobles who avidly pursued money and pleasure, the people of the Roman Empire sank into the lowest imaginable depths of debauchery. With most of the labor in the empire being done by about sixty million slaves, approximately one-half of the whole population, idleness became the way of life for the Romans. It created an attitude that was dangerous to the continued existence of the empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Speaking of the pernicious influence of protracted idleness among the Romans, John Lord states, in </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Beacon Lights of History:</span><span class="font14"> “Even in the time of Cicero, it was computed that there were only two thousand citizens possessed of independent property. These two thousand persons owned the world; the rest were dependent and powerless, and would have perished but for largesses. Monthly distributions of corn were converted into daily allowance for bread. The people were amused with games and festivals, fed like slaves, and of course lost at last even the semblance of manliness and independence. They loitered in the public streets, and dissipated in gaming their miserable pittance; they spent the hours of the night in the lowest resorts of crime and misery, . . . What are we to think of a state of society where all classes had continual leisure for these [Roman amusements]! Habits of industry were destroyed and all respect for employments that required labor.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The people of Jerusalem succumbed to idleness and suffered moral decay as Rome later did. They were so decadent that Ezekiel measured them up with Sodom, the name of a city that was infamous in Abraham’s day for moral corruption. Ezekiel said to the people of Jerusalem: “This was your sister Sodom’s crime: she and her daughters lived in pride, in plenty, and in careless ease; she never lent a hand to the weak and wretched.” (Ezek, 16:49, Mo) Like the Romans, these people were proud, selfish and idle. They brought upon themselves the condemnation of God for their wickedness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The part idleness played in contributing to the moral decay of ancient peoples should not be ignored today. Its insidious influence can be just as damaging now as it was then. Prolonged idleness deteriorates a man, destroying his ambition and his creative ability. The less he does, the less he wants to do. His unwillingness to work makes him useless to himself as well as to the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Because there are wealthy persons who live lives of ease and pleasure, doing nothing constructive, some persons think that this should be their goal in life. They want to be on what they call “easy street.” It is this desire that lures many persons into crime. For a person to seek a life of constant ease is utter folly. Man was not made to do nothing. He was made to work. Work is good for him, mentally and physically. It gives him a sense of accomplishment that makes life interesting and worthwhile. There is satisfaction in the life of one who works, doing things for his fellowman. Comparing the life of the worker with that of the rich man who no longer labors, the Bible says: “Sweet is the sleep of the one serving, regardless of whether it is little or much that he eats; but the plenty belonging to the rich one is not permitting him to sleep.”—Eccl. 5:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Making idleness a way of life is dangerous to a person’s well-being, his mental attitude, his moral behavior and his joy in life. It can cause him to become dangerous to the community by leading him along paths of crime in a pursuit for easy money. In the case of youths, it leads to delinquency. Do not despise honest work, no matter how tiring it may be. Recognize your need for it, remembering that work, not idleness, is the way of life that God purposed for man.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">straight, or lost their job because of not paying attention to the boss. But,it can </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font14">much more serious. Failing to pay close attention to the instructions of a doctor, the orders of a police officer, or the warnings of a lifeguard may lead to one’s losing one’s very life.-. Since it is for,a person’s welfare to heed such human authorities, how much more important it is to pay careful attention to the Scriptures, the infallible Word of the Supreme Authority, Jehovah God!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The apostle Peter made this point when he wrote; “You are doing well in paying attention to it [ God’s prophetic Wordj. as to a lamp shining in a dark place. . . . For you know this first, that no prophecy of Scripture springs from any private interpretation. For prophecy was at no time brought by man’s will, but men spoke from God as they were borne along by holy spirit.’’—2 Pet. 1:19-21.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">\ Are you paying attention? Why is it so important to do so?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font14">Bible writers to record</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">You have good reason to pay attention to the Scriptures, Peter argued, for they are inspired of God. Yes, God actually directed those cord the information that we need to build up our faith and to direct our lives. Just as a lamp illuminates a dark, unfamiliar path, making safe travel possible, so the Word of God can light up life’s roadway and dispel the darkness concealing the pit-</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark15"></a>000</span></h1>
<p><span class="font14">fal’s and rough spots. Every day decisions can be made, problems dealt with </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font14">difficulties faced. Only by paying close attention to the inspired Word of God can wise decisions be made, problems be solved satisfactorily and difficulties overcome. The psalmist knew God’s Word to be such an invaluable guide, fur he wrote: &quot;Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light to my roadway.”—Ps. 119:105.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">'Dir iuu Pay Attention ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Today few persons really pay attention to the Word of God. Oh, they may go to a religious service once or more a week and hear portions of the Bible read. But do they ponder over the Scriptures, ascertaining how they can be applied to themselves, or to circumstances that may eventually arise in their lives? Are their hopes and desires centered in the promises of God’s Word? Do they become absorbed in the Scriptures, taking in all the information and knowledge that they can? Do you find yourself paying such close attention to the Word of God ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It is important that we make an appraisal of ourselves from time to time, because it is on the basis of our knowledge of God that we devote ourselves to serving him. Such godly devotion should be the primary concern of our lives, for, as the apostle Paul explained to the young man Timothy, &quot;it holds promise of the life now and that which is to come.&quot;—1 Tim. 4:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Yes, paying attention to God's Word so that we can worship him properly is a life or death matter! That is why Paul went on to counsel Timothy: “Continue applying yourself to public reading, to exhortation, to teaching. . . . </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Ponder</span><span class="font14"> over these things; </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">be absorbed</span><span class="font14"> in them, that your advancement may be manifest to all persons. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Pay constant attention</span><span class="font14"> to yourself and to your teaching. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Stay by these things,</span><span class="font14"> for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.”—1 Tim. 4: If IG.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">From this it is evident that more -ian superficial reading of the Scriptures is needed. Just as physical food needs to be chewed to break it down into small particles so it can be digested and absorbed by the body, similarly, the spiritual food contained in God’s Word must be mulled over, broken down, and looked at and examined from different angles. Only then can it be digested so it will stay with us to supply the necessary spiritual strength. And just as one will become weak physically if he fails to eat two or three times a day, so one must “pay </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">constant</span><span class="font14"> attention” to the Word of God, day by day. The apostle Paul explained why it is important to do so: “That is why it is necessary for us to pay more than the usual attention to the things heard by us, that we may never drift away.&quot;—Heb. 2:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Jesus also emphasized the importance of paying special attention so that we do not lose a tight mental grip on the Word of God. Once, after telling an illustration wherein he likened the Word of God to seed sown on various types of soil, he said: “Pay attention to </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">how</span><span class="font14"> you listen.” “Pay attention to </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">what</span><span class="font14"> you are hearing.” Jesus knew that, if the people were to get the valuable instruction irom me illustration, they needed to think about it, ponder on its meaning, mull it over in their mind and, most importantly, apply the instruction in their own lives. Jesus said that if one failed to do this, he would not get the sense of the word, and the wicked one would snatch away the seed that had been sown.—Luke 8’.5-18; Mark 4:3-24; Matt. 13:18-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Examining Ourselves</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Since our life is dependent upon an accurate knowledge of God’s Word, it would be wise to examine ourselves as to how we pay attention to the Scriptures. Do not </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">let </span><span class="font14">fear of what you may discover keep you from doing this. If the results are disappointing, be </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">glad</span><span class="font14"> you are aware of your deficiency in knowledge, and take steps to correct it by paying closer attention in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A minister of a large church in California decided to make such an examination one Sunday morning. He asked his congregation to answer ten questions that normally required only a word or two by way of reply. The results were described as “staggering.” On marking the papers the minister found that nearly 25 percent of his congregation could not identify the place where Jesus was impaled, more than a third did not know the name of the town where he was reared and only a little more than half could name the Gospels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">If people are unable to answer such simple questions about the Bible, is it not unlikely that they apply its teachings in their lives? But we should not feel smug if we can answer these questions, or even more difficult ones, such as, What were the names of the twelve tribes of Israel? the twelve apostles? Who was the last king of Israel? Whereas it is desirable to have a knowledge of such things, it is even more important to have instilled within our mmas and neartg information that we can use to direct our lives in a way that will be pleasing to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">For example, if you were considering marriage, could you locate information in the Bible that would assist you to make a proper choice of a mate? If you were experiencing some friqtion in married life, would you know where to turn in the BiBle to find counsel as to your Scriptural role in the marriage arrangement? Do you know where in the Bible information is given on raising children? Where would you go in the Scriptures to find counsel on the procedure to take if you were not getting along with one of your associates? If you had to decide whether to take part in some nationalistic ceremony, could you turn to an example in the Bible, or to principles that would dictate what you should do? If you were involved in a serious accident and the doctor thought it necessitated a blood transfusion, would you know where to locate scriptures that discuss God’s law on blood? Although few, if any, of these decisions or problems may now face you, you may have to deal with them in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Remember too, Christians are admonished: Always be “ready to make a defense before everyone that demands of you a reason for the hope in you.” If one of your associates asked you any of these questions, as a Christian, you ought to be able to give him a Scriptural answer. Or he might want to know what all the present world trouble is leading to. Could you open up the Bible and show how these unparalleled world events were foretold to mark the last days? Could you thus prove from the Scriptures that the end of this wicked system of things is near and that God’s new world is close at hand?—1 Pet. 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">What your answers are to such questions is a good indication as to how well you have been heeding the apostolic command to pay attention to the Word of God. Be honest with yourself. ‘Keep testing whether you are in the faith, keep proving what you yourself are.’ Perhaps you have drifted a little. Maybe the examination revealed that your grasp on the Word of life was not as tight as it should be. Consider, then, how we might pay better attention. —2 Cor. 13:5; Phil. 2:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">How to Pay Attention</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">First, we will want to include in our daily schedule a time for the reading of the Scriptures, either privately or with other members of the family. We will also want to attend regularly the congregational meetings, where God’s Word is considered. And when reading the Bible at home or hearing it discussed at the meetings, we will want to concentrate on what is being said. This means we will continually ask ourselves questions: How does this affect my life? Does this call on me to make any adjustments to bring my attitude or actions into harmony with this expression of the divine will? How can I use this information in the ministry?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">This involves thinking while we read or listen—trying to figure out how we can use the information and apply it to our lives. We should be thinking not only while we are listening but also immediately afterward. This is important, for the points are still fresh in the mind, and by mulling them over and pondering upon them they will be fixed there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">This is paying more than usual attention, and that is what the apostle said we must do if we are to keep from drifting away. This is what it means to “ponder,” “be absorbed,” “pay constant attention” and “stay by these things.&quot; but the happy result will be that “you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.” —Heb. 2:1; 1 Tim. 4:15, 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">££TT IS the truth. It is un-</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">I</span><span class="font14"> questionable fact. And it is the beginning, the support and the constant touchstone of education.”<sup>1</sup> Thus </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopaedia Britannica</span><span class="font14"> is advertised by its publishers, who like to refer to it as the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19621122_files/g_E_19621122-5.png" alt="" style="width:223pt;height:504pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">Yes, by such publicity its publishers have succeeded in building up such an image regarding the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B.</span><span class="font14"> that even one of its severest critics recently was obliged to say: “It is an institution. Over the years it has come to represent the visible embodiment of scholarship, and for the general public has become the last court of appeal in settling factual questions.”<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Bearing this out is the fact that the Watch Tower Society, publishers of Bibles and Biblestudy aids, keeps receiving inquiries from sincere persons who are disturbed because the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B.</span><span class="font14"> at times contradicts the Bible, Among the subjects concerning which inquiry is made are evolution, the dates of the Egyptian dynasties as compared with the Bible, date of the flood of Noah’s day, and many of the better-known Bible characters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Is there reason for such persons to be disturbed ? Not at all. The evidences in favor of the Bible’s authenticity, among which must be mentioned its accurate history as proved a thousand times over bymodem archaeological findings, its trueness to human nature, its frankness and candor, its great laws and wise principles, and in particular the fulfillment of many of its prophecies, all justify our accepting it for being what it claims to be, a divine revelation, the inspired Word of the Creator, Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Consistent with the Bible’s claim to be the inspired Word of God is the fact that it has influenced mankind for good more than any other book ever written. Well has it been termed the torch of civilization and of liberty. And consistent also with its claim to have been provided by the Creator for all mankind we find that this book has the widest circulation of any book ever written and that in by far the most languages, 1,181 thus far.<sup>3</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Incomplete State of</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Man’s Knowledge</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Of</span><span class="font14"> course, the editors of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B.</span><span class="font14"> cannot lay claim to inspiration or even to divine guidance. They are prone to make the same mistakes that all other imperfect humans do, partly due to the incomplete state of man’s knowledge and partly due to human frailty and selfishness. Besides, as the Bible shows, “faith is not a possession of all people,” and so it should not surprise us to find a lack of faith manifest on the part of the editors of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B. </span><span class="font14">—2 Thess. 3:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Since man is ever learning, he repeatedly finds himself obliged to discard what yesterday appeared to him to be truth for what appears to be- truth today, and the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B.</span><span class="font14"> is no exception. For example: For ever so many years E.B. published the story that Galileo proved that objects of unequal weight fall to the earth at the same velocity, this being based on what one Vivani reported. However, modern research has revealed that “what Vivani did not know was that a friend of Galileo and not Galileo himself dropped the weights from the Leaning Tower [of Pisa] and discovered that they did </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font14"> fall to the ground in the same time.”<sup>2</sup> Thus all these years </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B.</span><span class="font14"> contained a glaring scientific error, and so was not “unquestionable fact,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Here is an example involving the Bible: The 9th edition of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B.</span><span class="font14"> took a very dim view of what the Bible had to say about the Hittites: “The lists of [Hittite] pre-Israelitish populations cannot be taken as strictly historical documents. ... It is obvious [these Biblical] narratives written . . . so long after the events referred to cannot be taken as of equal authority with Egyptian and Assyrian inscriptions . . . No less favorable to the accuracy of the Old Testament references to the Hittites is the evidence deducible from proper names. . . . Is it unnatural to infer that these three names are not less fictitious than the Semitic names ascribed in the Old Testament to the non-Semitic Philistines?’<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark16">1</a></sup> —Vol. 12, page 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">But current editions of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B.</span><span class="font14"> adopt an entirely different tone toward the Bible record: “The Hittite race, ‘the sons of Heth/ . , . was known to the writers of the Old Testament, ... In confirmation and'amplification of these Old Testament accounts, Egyptian evidence shows,” and so forth. Due to archaeological discoveries </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B.</span><span class="font14"> was obliged to do an entire about-face as to the value of the Bible record regarding the Hittites.—1959 edition, Vol. 11, pages 598-B, 599.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In view of the foregoing it is not surprising that the dates </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B.</span><span class="font14"> gives for certain Egyptian dynasties do not agree with the Bible, Among the various dates </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B. </span><span class="font14">has given for the beginning of the first Egyptian dynasty are 5,005, 3,892, 3,350 and 3,200 B.C.<sup>4, 8</sup> Might it not be that more complete knowledge will give a yet lower date for this dynasty, assuming that it came after the Flood, 2,369 B.C.? Especially is this a reasonable deduction in view of archaeologist Albright’s observation that modem archaeological discoveries have required Egyptian dates to be progressive.. lowered.<sup>6</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Yielding to Popular Opinion</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B.,</span><span class="font14"> being strictly a commercia venture,<sup><a href="#bookmark16">1</a></sup> of course feels compelled to cater to popular opinions, which likewise causes it repeatedly to fail to measure up to its claim to be the “constant touchstone of education.” A noteworthy example is its treatment of the evolution theory. It presents evolution “as a fact.”<sup>8</sup> But the French Academy thought so little of Darwin’s ‘Tacts” that it denied him membership on the basis of his evolution theory. Said one of its members in explanation: “What has closed the doors of the Academy to Mr. Darwin is that the science of those books which have made his chief title to fame— the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Origin of Species</span><span class="font14"> and still more the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Descent of Man</span><span class="font14">—is not science, but a mass of assertions and absolutely gratuitous hypotheses often evidently fallacious. This kind of publication and these theories are a bad example, which a body that respects itself cannot encourage.”—</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Les Mondes.<sup>9</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In discussing mutations </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B.</span><span class="font14"> tells only one side of the story. It fails to tell of the vain results of thousands of experiments made with mutations by the University of Washington under the direction of L. R, Donaldson. According to him no useful mutations appeared and none were anticipated. “So far as we know we’re not getting any good characteristics. You can’t add when you’re subtracting,”<sup>10</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Nor does </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B.,</span><span class="font14"> in considering this subject, take note of Virchow, whose cellular concept has been termed “the central fact of modem biology,” According to him such specimens as the Neanderthal man were pathological, that is, diseased, abnormal, and he held it folly to “try to establish new prehistoric races on the basis of one single specimen.”<a name="footnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark17">2</a></sup> He also kept insisting that evolution should not be considered anything more than an interesting hypothesis, since proofs for It were lacking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Jean L. R. Agassiz disposed of the evolution theory with the words: “A scientific mistake, untrue in its facts, unscientific in its method, and mischievous in its tendency.”<sup>11</sup> And who is this Agassiz? Says </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B.</span><span class="font14"> “As a teacher of science he was extraordinarily skillful, certainly the ablest America has ever known . . . The result of his instruction at Harvard was a complete revolution in natural history study in America,” because he insisted on going directly to the book of nature instead of to schoolbooks for his facts, “Every notable teacher of natural history in the United States for the second half of the 19th century was at some time a pupil of Agassiz or of one of his students.” His summer school was “the school of all schools which has had the greatest influence on science teaching in America,” And to sum up, “Agassiz was beyond question one of the ablest, wisest and best informed biologists of his day,” </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B.</span><span class="font14"> tries to account for his “cold and unsympathetic . . . attitude toward Darwinism,&quot; but the fact remains that for Agassiz “each species of animal or plant was in itself ‘a thought of God.’ ”<sup>M</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Higher Criticism</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Another way in which </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B,</span><span class="font14"> has sacrificed truth to popular opinion is in its adopting “higher criticism,&quot; which is destructive of faith in the Bible, in dealing with Bible subjects. It portrays Aaron as a rival of Moses and speaks of “a tradition of hostility between Moses and Aaron,” and says that “the process by which tradition changed Aaron from being a possible rival to Moses to his ecclesiastical counterpart has never been satisfactorily explained.”<sup>1</sup>’ That this of itself should throw doubt on the tradition of hostility between Moses and Aaron never occurred to these “higher critics.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Regarding Abel, earlier editions of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B. </span><span class="font14">were content with what the Bible had to say about him, but current editions try to discredit the Bible record by observing that “possibly Abel originally was a South Judean demigod or hero.”<sup>14</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font14">There is a similar difference between what earlier and later editions of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B.</span><span class="font14"> say about Enoch. The earlier ones recognize that four persons by this name are mentioned in the Bible and state that to base a mythical interpretation on his life because his years are the same as the number of days in a year “seems more ingenious than sound.”<sup>1</sup>’ But current editions confuse the various Enochs mentioned in the Bible and state that &quot;the brief notice in Gen. 5:21-24 is certainly a fragment of an Enoch myth.,,. The fact that his years are given as 365 suggests that he was a solar hero.”<sup>10</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Regarding Samson the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B.</span><span class="font14"> currently, among other things, states: “It has, indeed, been argued that the entire Samson story is a solar myth; but it is apparently much more highly probable that In this case the story of a popular hero has been expanded and decorated by mythological motifs. Why does a story so lacking in religious interest appear in the book? . . , There is some evidence that the story was not included in an earlier form of Judges, and that a later editor was constrained by its popularity to insert it.”<sup>17</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Does not the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B..</span><span class="font14"> by publishing such theories of higher criticism, go counter to its claim to be the repository of &quot;unquestionable fact”? Surely all this higher criticism Is mere speculation that often not only is contradictory but also has repeatedly been proved wrong by archaeological discoveries. Would it not be more consistent simply to summarize what the Bible has to say about its characters and then present it as just that? Surely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Truth versus “Tolerance”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B.</span><span class="font14"> has further failed to live up to its claim as the &quot;constant touchstone of education” by yielding to religious pressure or, in the interests of “tolerance,&quot; wanting to avoid offending anyone. The apostle Paul asked the Christians at Galatia: &quot;Have I become your enemy because I tell you the truth?” (Gal. 4:16) But the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B.</span><span class="font14"> takes no chances on making enemies by telling the truth. Not that this was always its policy. Its most famed as well as most scholarly edition, the 11th, spoke plainly regarding the shortcomings of Christendom, because of which it received a storm of abuse from Catholic groups, although certain leading Catholic scholars fully exonerated the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B<a name="footnote3"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark18">3</a></sup></span><span class="font14"> Nevertheless, it yielded to religious pressure, as can be noted from the following representative examples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Under the heading &quot;Eunuchs,” current editions of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B.,</span><span class="font14"> among other things, state: &quot;The Italian practice of castrating boys in order to train them as adult soprano singers ended with the accession of Leo XIII.”<sup>1</sup>'</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">But what are the facts? They are as stated in the 11th edition: “Even more vile, as being practiced among a civilized European nation, has been the Italian practice of castrating boys to prevent the natural development of the voice, in order to train them as adult soprano singers, such as might till lately be heard in the Sistine Chapel. Though such mutilation is a crime punishable with severity, the supply of such ‘soprani’ never failed so long as their musical powers were in demand in high quarters. Driven long ago from the Italian stage by public opinion, they remained the musical glory and the moral shame of the papal choir till the accession of the present pope (Leo XIII) one of whose first acts was to get rid of them.”<sup>10 </sup>So, instead of the Vatican bringing to an end the<sup>7</sup> use of eunuch sopranos in Italy, it was the last to stop using them! Was not the truth here sacrificed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A similar example is found under the heading of &quot;celibacy.” For some fifty years the writer of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B,</span><span class="font14"> article on the subject had been a professor of English at Oxford University. He gave an objective presentation of the subject and was also used by </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B.</span><span class="font14"> to write on other historical matters. For more extensive information he recommended the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">History of Sacerdotal Celibacy,</span><span class="font14"> by the American historian Henry C. Lea, &quot;by far the fullest and best work on the subject.”<sup>20</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font14">But in recent editions of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B.</span><span class="font14"> another article appears, one that is slanted In favor of clerical celibacy. It refers the reader to various German and French works and, for English readers, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Encyclopedia.</span><span class="font14"> It also mentions Lea but states that he is charged with superficial and biased scholarship.<sup>21</sup> What are the facts?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In the first place it may well be asked, How could one expect to obtain an impartial view of such a controversial institution as clerical celibacy by consulting a Roman Catholic encyclopedia? And as for the merits of Henry C. Lea, American scholars agree that he was “the first and greatest of American scientific historians.” His history of the Spanish Inquisition is the “most extensive, the most profound, and the most thorough of the inquisition which we possess.”<a name="footnote4"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark19">4</a></sup> He never wrote “with any other purpose of bias save that of eliciting the facts.”<sup>22</sup> His work was stamped with “love of truth, interest in science,” and no one could tell by his works what was his religion. He received degrees from leading European and American universities; in fact, he was even more esteemed and appreciated in Europe than in the United States.<sup>23</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font14">But who is the writer of the current article on celibacy in </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B.</span><span class="font14"> that casts slurs on this noted historian Henry C. Lea? And what are his qualifications? He is H.R.W., with no other qualifications given save that of being a Jesuit priest in Japan and who wrote nothing else in </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B,</span><span class="font14"> save the article on celibacy.<sup>24</sup> Why replace an Oxford English professor with a literary unknown in Japan? An interesting question that allows for more than one answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The subject of heresy furnishes another noteworthy example. The famed 11th edition told that persecution for heresy had been practiced by pagans, Moslems, Catholics and Protestants, honestly telling the facts, showing neither fear nor favor. Socrates had been “indicted as an irreligious man, a corrupter of youth, and an innovator of worship.” Persecution of sects within Mohammedanism was also shown to be common. Regarding Christendom itstated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“As long as the Christian Church was itself persecuted by the pagan empire, it advocated freedom of conscience, and insisted that religion could be promoted only by instruction and persuasion (Justyn Martyr, Tertullian, Lactanius); but almost immediately after Christianity was adopted as the religion of the Roman empire the persecution of men for religious opinions began . . . Arianism, when favored by the reigning emperor, showed itself even more intolerant than Catholic Orthodoxy [had been of it] . . . In the middle ages the church showed no hesitation about persecuting unto death all who dared contradict her doctrine, or challenge her practice, or question her authority ... In the Albigensian Crusade (A.D. 1209-1229) thousands were slaughtered.”<sup>25</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Further, this 11th edition told how Luther at first claimed that “heresy is a spiritual thing which one cannot hew with any iron, bum with any fire, drown with any water. The Word of God alone is there to do it,&quot; yet later he became party to an agreement where the ruler decided the religion of his subjects and those who disagreed could emigrate but could not practice their religion in the dominion of such a ruler. Calvin’s consenting to the death of Servetus for denying the trinity is also noted, as well as the fact that in times past Protestants quite approved of the execution of heretics.<sup>20</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font14">All this wealth of telling testimony regarding heresy has now disappeared. There is reference to the minor heresies of early Christendom, a glossing passing reference to Catholic and Protestant persecution of heresy and a discussion of “scientific” heresy.Thus the truth is thrown out the window so as to avoid offending anyone: pagan Greek, Moslem, Catholic, Protestant</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">So what? Does this mean that such authorities as </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B.</span><span class="font14"> should not be consulted? Not at all! Without doubt, it and works like it serve a good purpose and, in fact, should be consulted even more than they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">But the foregoing should suffice to show that “truth” as presented by man is a relative thing. It may be incomplete due to imperfect knowledge, or it may be distorted or slanted, partial or circumscribed because of human frailty; and this is especially true of matters touching the Bible, since, as has been noted, “faith is not a possession of all people.”—2 Thess. 3:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It all calls to mind what the Scriptures have to say about the governments of this world. They serve a useful purpose and are to be obeyed; even dedicated Christian ministers are to be in subjection to them —but only relatively, that is, so long as these governments do not go contrary to God’s will. Caesar may/never ask what belongs to God. (Mark ±2:17) So with such literary authorities as </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">E.B.</span><span class="font14"> They may be accepted, in the absence of something better, or so long as they do not conflict with God's Word, the Bible, which alone is infallible truth,—John 17:17.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">THE DISHONORABLE BLOOD MU5BGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">• Under this headline a Viennese weekly paper </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(EXPRESS am Wochenende,</span><span class="font13"> November 26, 1960) had this to say about an edict of days gone by:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“Even the ancient Greeks and Remaps enjoyed sausages thoroughly, the main ingredient of which was in fact garlic. The use of animal blood in preparing sausages apparently came up in the time of the East-Roman emperor Leo VI (A,D. 886-911). He, who was called the wise man or the scholar, issued an edict by which the preparation and taking of blood sausage was forbidden. In his prohibition he quoted the older prohibition concerning the eating of blood in the Old and New Testament, and complained that people, partly because of profit, partly because of being lickerish, have become so extravagant as to convert blood into an eatable food. Then the edict says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&quot; 'It has gotten to our ears that blood is being wrapped up in intestines like in skirts, and is thus being sent to the stomach as a dish. Our Imperial Majesty can no longer tolerate and permit this disgrace to be brought upon the honor of our state by such a wicked invention of people only greedy after gluttony. Who therefore converts blood into food, or merely buys or sells it, his property shall be confiscated, he himself scourged severely, as a sign of his dishonorableness he shall be sheared to the skin, and forever banned from the empire. Also, the authorities, because of having not been more vigilant in their office, and having allowed such an outrage to take place, shall make amends by paying ten pounds of gold.' ’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“But the edict was considered as just so much ‘sausage’ by the subjects. Blood sausage continued to hold its own,” even as today unrighteous persons ignore the edicts in God’s own Word that forbid the eating of blood. —Gen. 9:4; Acts 15:28, 29.</span></p>

<p><span class="font21">W</span><span class="font14">HAT the Creator has done for the Cauca Valley of Colombia is marvelous indeed. By locating it just three degrees north of the equator and raising it 3,000 feet above the surface of the Pacific, He endowed it with perennial summertime. To prevent it from being lashed with violent winds and tempestuous rains, He hemmed it in on the west and on the east by majestic ranges of the Andes. Then atop the flat valley floor He rolled out a twenty-mlle-wide carpet of rich volcanic soil capable of producing two or three harvests of crops each year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Abundant rainfall in the mountains keeps numerous streams and small rivers flowing across green fields to join the leisurely Cauca, which meanders aimlessly, serpentlike, throughout the length of this ISO-mile stretch of subtropical fertility, before entering a deep and heavily forested gorge to begin its northward quest for the salt waters of the Caribbean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">An abundance of bright sunny days; refreshing scattered showers, punctuated with gorgeous rainbows; pleasant midafternoon breezes descending from the mountain slopes; a flood of brilliant sunlight casting long shadows across fruitful</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">fields just before the late </span><span class="font14">afternoon sun drops behind the western cordillera; an occasional glimpse of distant snowcapped peaks glistening radiantly in the rays of the setting sun, followed by incomparably lovely nights with a caressing warmth that could inspire a song—all of these were added to complete God’s gift to Colombia’s Valle del Cauca. When the Spaniard arrived in the early sixteenth century, it was love at first sight. His search was over. Here is where he would settle down for the remainder of his days. He sent back home for his horses and cattle, donkeys and goats, chickens and pigs. His religion he brought along too, and he began to build churches and missions and to convert the natives to Catholicism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In the nineteenth century he fought for independence and embarked on the turbulent, often violent, river of political contention and strife. He launched steamboats on the leisurely Cauca, drained swamplands and set great herds of cattle out to graze. His sugarcane and coffee began to find their way out into the markets of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It is only since World War 11  that the four-and-a-quarter-century-old Santiago de Cali, the Valley’s capital, has begun to shake itself from the dreams of the past to take on the air of a modern industrial metropolis. Old buildings, proudly reminiscent of gallant </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">caballeros</span><span class="font14"> and sophisticated ladies, have had to surrender to the inexorable force of the wrecking bar and the bulldozer blade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Much of the Old Spanish &quot;Cavallera”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">While much of the old colonial atmosphere is still there, modernistic homes built around bright sunny patios have multiplied and grown into attractive residential barrios with palm-lined boulevards and well-kept parks. Here is where the wealthy descendants of old Spanish colonists and the aspiring members of a newly emerging middle class live in contentment and ease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">And just what is this Vallecaucano like today? He may be a banker or a businessman, a doctor, a lawyer or an architect, an accountant, a salesman or a professor. He is educated, intelligent and surprisingly well informed about the world in which he lives. There is still much of the old Spanish </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">caballero</span><span class="font14"> in him, as evidenced by his cultured poise and his precise correctness of manners. He likes his club, the restaurant and his midmorning demitasse of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">tinto,</span><span class="font14"> the coffee upon which the Colombian economy rests. His gracious wife and daughters, dedicated to stylish dress, elegant coiffures and carefully manicured nails, admirably fulfill their assigned role of pleasing the dominant male of the Valley, while still finding considerable time for social activities, the movies and going to church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Not particularly religious himself, he frequently attends church just to please his wife, though his early religious training permeates his thinking far more than he realizes. His politics and economics he does take seriously. He worries about communism, nuclear war and the price of coffee on the world market</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Believes in God, But . . ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">But, then, the Vallecaucano may also be a farmer or a shoemaker, a carpenter, a cowboy or a mechanic. Before the morning sun peeks over the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Cordillera Central </span><span class="font14">you may see him riding his bicycle down the dark highway with scores of others on their way to a long day’s work in a sugar mill. Or in a modern factory he operates a machine forty-eight hours a week. His home, humble in itself, has been made attractive with potted plants and colorful flowers. He, too, is courteous and polite, and his family a model of hospitality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Despite his lack of formal schooling, he is alert and interested in life. He reads the newspaper each day and likes to converse about Khrushchev and Kennedy, atomic tests and space flights. Communism does not terrify him the way it does his more affluent brothers. He works with some Communists, has listened to their arguments and has read their literature; but he is not overly impressed with their talk of a Communist workers’ paradise. He has had enough of dictatorships and does not favor any government that leans too far to the left or to the right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Ask him about religion and he will probably say: “I am Catholic, I believe in God, but I don't like the priests.” To him the church has always been the solicitous friend of a feudalists, conservative society, favoring the privileged few and seldom going out of the way to help the common man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Strange though it may seem, however, he does not spend his time brooding over the high salaries, country clubs, fine homes and shiny automobiles of his more affluent brothers. He rather accepts that as an unalterable fact of life. But when he takes a bus ride out through the valley and views the expansive plantations of sugarcane, cotton and rice, he is forcefully reminded that the majority of these lush green fields are the property of comparatively few men and their families. Then as the bus speeds into one of the many old towns that dot the Valley at regular intervals, slowing down to pass through narrow streets of humble houses jammed one against the other, with an incredible number of families and children crowded into one block,, he cannot quite understand why, with so much good land here in the Valley, things have to be this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming of Violence</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The Vallecaucano likes to reminisce about the good old days before 1948, when everything was </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">tranquility</span><span class="font14"> throughout all the Valley. A person was safe out walking alone any hour of the day or night. Then violence came to the Valley.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">At first it was political. The Conservatives, who were in power, drove the Liberals off their land; then the Liberals organized guerrilla bands to fight back, both sides massacring whole families ruthlessly, including women and children of all ages. It was virtual civil war. Few persons outside Colombia realize the extent of the slaughter. Discussing the matter, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Time </span><span class="font14">magazine of February 23,1962, said in its Latin-American edition:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“Senseless violence in Colombia’s back-lands has killed more than 300,000 Colombians in the past 14 years—a figure greater than the battle deaths of all U.S. forces in World War II. . . , After years of fighting most of the marauders now pay only lip service to politics. The killing is largely for killing’s sake., . . The main battlefield is in the s</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">mall</span><span class="font14">, heavily settled department of Valle (pop. 1,596,650) west of Bogota, where, on the average, three people are murdered each day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Thus great numbers of Colombians have learned to live only by violence. This legacy has helped keep thousands of bandits going; the bandit gangs are often made up of eight to ten youths who are viciously sadistic. These gangs have wiped out whole families in the rurals, usually beheading their human victims with machetes and then doing the same to dogs, pigs and chickens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">With such brutal violence and so many killings, what hope does the Vallecaucano have for the future? His first hope is that the government will soon put an end to the violence and bring back tranquillity. He appreciates the progress that has been made. But, while he listens to what men project for the future, he is apprehensive in view of the violence of the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">To have the tranquillity he desires, he realizes that there has to be a change in the outlook and values of the people. Political parties can impose new legislation oh the people, but they cannot change what man is inside. The church does not bring the change because it simply adopts the standards of the society around it. It is evident that the church has not been an effective force to prevent fourteen years of bloodshed, though the majority of disputants have grown up in its faith. The Vallecaucano who realizes this but who has not lost his faith in God is finding cause for confidence in his study of the Bible. He has cause for confidence. He can see what God has already done for his valley. He can see the change Bible principles make in one’s life. He can read about the hope the Bible holds forth of a peaceful new world. It is evident to him from the daily provisions that make life possible that God has not forsaken man.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">mals such as the woodchuck are altered so they can sleep for six or seven months without food and drink. One thing is certain, however; these animals did not get their strange ability by their own efforts. The One who designed their little bodies gave it to</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">W</span><span class="font14">HEN the first gentle fall of fluffy snowflakes carpets northern lands with a white blanket, a strange^ transformation will already have taken place among some of the wild animals. Unlike the creatures that migrate to warmer places before the coming of winter, these animals stay where they are. They survive through months of freezing temperatures and scarcity of food by sleeping. The woodchuck is one of these unusual animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Well below the frostline, the woodchuck, curled up into a furry ball, quietly sleeps the winter months away. He is snuggled at the end of a burrow that is from ten to twenty-five feet long with sloping side tunnels for drainage. Completely oblivious to the icy winds of winter and the piling up of many feet of snow on the ground four to five feet above him, he sleeps on, waiting for spring, when, in some mysterious way, he will be awakened to renew his active life. Even if the temperature in his burrow should drop to a few degrees above freezing, he will not be disturbed, for his sleep is no ordinary sleep. It is the strange winter sleep of hibernation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Although scientists have been studying hibernation for many years, it is still a mystery to them. They are not certain as to what actually triggers it, and they do not know how the bodily functions of ani-them so they might be able to survive the rigors of winter. He caused it to be an automatic thing that would be tr</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">igg</span><span class="font14">ered in the fall of the year and then terminated at the proper time in the spring. When it begins, the functions of their bodies automatically slow down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Change in Body Functions</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The change from normal activity to winter sleep is gradual, involving drastic changes in a hibernator’s body. From three to thirty days is required for the woodchuck to reach full dormancy. It does it in steps of increasingly longer drowsy periods followed by periods of wakefulness. Some animals descend into it smoothly without interruption. During this time the animal’s heartbeat, respiration and temperature gradually decline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In normal activity the heart of the woodchuck beats at a rate of 80 beats a minute, which is unusually low for a warm-blooded animal of its size. A ground squirrel has a normal heartbeat of 360 a minute; the hamster has one of about 270 a minute, and the bat has one of 180 a minute. During hibernation the heartbeats of these creatures is phenomenally low. The heart of the woodchuck slows to around four or five beats a minute; the squirrel’s drops to three a minute, the hamstar’s to about four, and the bat's to two or three. Despite this slow heartbeat, the blood pressure remains near normal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Although blood circulation la slow, the cells of the hibernator’s body are not starved for oxygen. This is surprising, especially in view of the fact that Its rate of respiration Is also greatly reduced. Normally, the woodchuck breathes at least twenty-five to thirty times a minute, but during hibernation it takes one breath a minute and sometimes one in every five minutes. The thirteen-lined ground squirrel drops its respiration from a rate of 100-200 breaths a minute to a rate of from one-half to four a minute. Breathing in hibernators is commonly irregular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Because the rate of chemical changes, or metabolism, in the body of the dormant woodchuck is greatly slowed down, its cells do not require much oxygen. A certain amount of oxygen is left in the blood notwithstanding the animal’s slow respiration. Gradually the blood becomes saturated with oxygen. This is evident in the paws of the ground squirrel. Their normal color is gray, but during hibernation they take on a pink color because of the reddish color of Its oxygen-rich blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The body temperature of hibernators undergoes a startling reduction during their descent into winter sleep. A bat’s temperature drops precipitously from about 100° F. to around 40° F., or the approximate temperature of its den. The temperature of the woodchuck slides from 96. 8° F. to about 37° F., or to a few degrees above its surroundings. The same is true of the hamster, whose body temperature will stay about one degree above that of its environment, even when the temperature of its environment Is down to freezing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The automatic temperature regulator given these little animals by the Creator prevents them from freezing. When the surrounding temperature drops below treezmg, their metabolism automatically increases threefold or more. Should freezing still threaten them, It will wake them up. Strangely enough, low temperatures never cause a hibernating animal to become frostbitten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The Creator designed these little creatures to have heart and muscle tissues that are a little different from those of non-hibernating animals. The human heart, for example, could not stand the drastic temperature reduction that the heart of the woodchuck endures. It reacts badly when body temperature is lowered to between 70 and 80° F. by beating irregularly. The woodchuck’s heart, on the other hand, is designed to work smoothly when the body temperature is only one degree above freezing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Food</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Even with an astoundingly low rate of metabolism, a hibernating animal needs a certain amount of nourishment. Usually this Is obtained from the large quantities of fat stored in its body. Weeks before hibernation begins for a woodchuck—usually in September—it greatly increases its food intake. By the time it begins its winter sleep it will weigh as much as four times its usual weight and will have thick layers of fat on its body. From about the middle of September until about the middle of March its body draws upon this stored fat, which is its only source of energy. The woodchuck’s sleep is not unbroken, however, for it wakes up about every three weeks to relieve itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Unlike the woodchuck and bat that usually eat nothing during their period of sleep, the ground squirrel wakes up periodically to eat some of its stored food. This and its body fat keep it nourished. The amount of food needed by a hibemator is very small. A hamster uses only one-thirtieth to one-fiftieth of its normal energy during moernation. It too wakes up occasionally to nibble on some food, but the behavior of hibernating animals varies even within the same animal kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Winter Sleepers</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Among mammals, reptiles and insects a number of creatures can be found that spend either a portion or the greater part of winter sleeping, but few are true hiber-nators. A hibernator is technically considered to be a creature that experiences a greatly reduced body temperature, heartbeat and rate of respiration during winter sleep. Upon this basis a bear could not be classed as a hibernator. It is instead a deep sleeper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A bear’s metabolism does not slow down to the extent common in woodchucks, hamsters, ground squirrels, bats, and so forth. Instead of the bear’s temperature dropping to a few degrees above freezing, it remains only a few degrees below normal. Respiration also remains relatively normal. During winter it may wake up occasionally and spend a whole day outside if there is a warm spell. At such times it will eat if food can be found. While sleeping it draws energy from its stored fat. The common black bear puts on about a four-inch layer of fat before beginning its winter sleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A male bear of some species will sometimes keep active for most of the winter if it can find enough to eat, but the female will seek out a den in a hollow tree trunk, a cave or upturned roots and will go to sleep there. During her winter sleep she gives birth to tiny cubs that weigh only eight to twelve ounces. They are smaller in proportion to her weight than the young of almost any other mammal. This is a wise provision of the Creator, since her principal source of energy for several months is only her stored fat. Her sleep is not so sound that she is not conscious of her young. If they make any sound of discomfort, she will shift her position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Since a bear’s winter sleep is not true hibernation, it wakes from it much more quickly and easily than does a woodchuck. Two or three hours arc needed for a woodchuck to return to normal activity. As it comes out of hibernation its bodily functions speed up at an exaggerated rate. Its heartbeat leaps up to 200 a minute, more than twice its normal beat of eighty. Its breathing likewise exceeds its normal rate. At the end of two or three hours its body is functioning as usual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">For a long time birds were not considered as having any hibernators among them, but in the 1940’s an American scientist discovered, by chance, a poorwill that was hibernating in a California gorge. It is of the same family as the whippoorwill. For eighty-eight days it remained in a torpor, not even waking when a sleet storm buffeted its back, which was exposed from its shallow hole. Its body temperature registered a low of 64.4° F., which is a sizable drop from its normal 106° F. Its breathing and heartbeat were imperceptible. Repeated weighings during its hibernation revealed fractional losses in body weight. At the end of its lengthy sleep it slowly woke up and flew away. The bird was closely observed for four seasons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Because of their lowered rate of metabolism, it has been suggested that hibernating animals do not age while dormant, but recent evidence seems to prove otherwise. Some growth continues during this period, notwithstanding extremely low body temperatures. This became evident in a female tortoise during its twenty-three-week period of hibernation. While sleeping, it regenerated part of its lower jaw that had been missing. Hibernation does, however, seem to affect the life-span of animals. It appears that hibernators usually live much longer than non-hibernators their size.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Water turtles sleep away the winter buried in the mud at the bottom of their watery world. During that time their need for oxygen is so small that they can stay there without breathing for three months or more. Some turtles have special bladders for taking oxygen from water. Land turtles burrow about two feet into soft ground and hibernate there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Like other cold-blooded creatures, the temperature of turtles and snakes is always close to that of their surroundings. Their survival, therefore, through cold winter months is made possible by their ability to hibernate. Snakes frequently hibernate in clusters with their bodies intertwined. They choose holes in the ground that take them below the frostline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The amount of weight that is lost by winter sleepers varies greatly. A hoop snake was found to lose only one ounce out of a total weight of three pounds eleven ounces during a hibernation from November 4 to March 6. Some warm-blooded hibernators also show only slight weight losses, while others may lose 30 to 40 percent of their body weight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Estivation</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In hot lands a torpor comes on some animals that is similar to winter sleep in cold lands. It is called estivation. This occurs during hot, dry periods when food and water are scarce. It is a means for their survival. The African lungfish survives the drying up of a stream by burrowing into the mud and shaping a cavity there. After lining it with mucus that hardens into a type of cocoon, the lungfish falls into a torpor that allows it to survive until the rains come and fill the stream with water. There are insects that survive dry periods in a somewhat similar manner. The larvae of the caddis flies, for example, burrow into the mud at the bottom of their pond and stay there until the dry pond has water in it again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Some land snails also survive dry spells by burrowing into the ground and sleeping. They prevent loss of moisture by sealing the opening of their shell with hardened mucus. Like the lungfish, they leave a small opening for air. They remain in this lethargic state until a prolonged shower comes to revive them. Snails in cold climates also seal themselves in their shells during dormancy. They hibernate from four to six months in the winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Cold, hunger, darkness and quiet appear to be contributing factors to bringing on hibernation. But there is great variation as to how winter sleepers respond to them. Some, like the woodchuck and chipmunk, will begin hibernating while there is lots of food. The air can still be warm when the woodchuck begins his long sleep, but other animals become lethargic when the temperature drops. In zoos where food and temperature are constant, animals seldom hibernate. There is much about wintersleeping animals that man has yet to learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In the wild and natural habitat of animals survival is an ever-present problem. They succeed in existing, not because of any wisdom of their own, but because their Creator, Jehovah God, has thought for them, giving them a guiding instinct. He has put into their bodies automatic guidance for meeting the problem of survival.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Historical Background </span><span class="font14">As far back as we know,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font21">F</span><span class="font14">IOM time immemorial men have had territory disputes, often resulting in bloody warfare and displacement of tens of thousands from their homeland. All too often race issues have been involved. In our day efforts are made at an international level to settle such quarrels. Quite likely you have personally witnessed the misery that territorial disputes entail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Let us have a close look at one such disputed territory, South-West Africa, and the issues involved. This vast land, about 900 miles long and 350 miles wide, covers some 318,000 square miles; roughly it is about as large as France and Italy combined. Its population is only a little more than 500,000, of which about 10 percent is white.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Most of the land is arid; much of it is desert For a thousand miles along the west coast, and up to eighty miles inland, stretches the Namib desert with its huge sand dunes, from the mouth of the Orange to that of the Cunene, the two constantly flowing boundary rivers. Other rivers of the territory are mostly waterless, sandy courses, changing to seething masses of foaming water after heavy rain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">East of the Namib desert lies a vast plateau, rising from south to north and ranging from 2,500 to 4,800 feet above sea level. Here subterranean water sources are reasonably plentiful. In the far north of this land of contrasts stretches the Etosha pan, 2,300 square miles in extent, and part of an enormous game reserve of thousands of square miles. This reserve includes part of the Kaokoveld, which is undulating, rock-strewn hilly country. Adjacent to it the Bushmen lived in this territory. Long after the Bushmen, Daniaras and Na-mas (Hottentots), the Bantu came on the scene.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">Forced out of Bechuanaland about 1550, the Hereros settled in the Kaokoveld, but were presently in violent conflict with the Ovambos, as a result of cattle thieving on both sides. The Hereros were driven south to settle in the central part of the plateau, their present homeland. Here they clashed with the Namas, who eventually drove them from the site of the present capital, Windhoek.</span></p>

This was reflected in the claim of the Namas: “Where the tracks of our hunters lie in the veld, there is our home, there is Namaland.” To which claim the Hereros countered: “Wherever our herds of cattle graze in the veld, there are the </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">boundaries </span><span class="font14">of Hereroland.&quot; Small wonder, then, that even before the advent of the white man this disputed territory was the scene of endless racial strife and bloodshed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">After the sea route from Europe to India had been found, late in the fifteenth century, mariners of various nationalities touched at different points on the coast. Just two centuries ago, the first white hunters, traders and travelers began visiting the territory sporadically from the south. Early in the nineteenth century missionaries started coming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">During the last quarter of that century an effort to place the territory under the control of the Cape Colony failed. Soon the Basters asked protection from the German empire. Later, also the Nainas and the Hereros came under its protection. In 1885, after negotiations with Great Britain and the Cape Colony, Germany took the territory as a protectorate. At first its development was left to traders, but very soon the German government took this responsibility on itself. Vigorous action brought native wars to an end. But now the erstwhile enemies combined against the whites. The tragic struggle that ensued cost a vast sum of money and the lives of many thousands before peaceful conditions came in 1907.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The Germans set their outposts at the southern level of the Etosha pan, dividing the territory into two parts with an imaginary boundary now known as the Red Line. North of it lie the Kaokoveld, Ovamboland, Okavango and Caprivi. Here there are no established white interests, but this is the homeland of the territory’s Bantu and Bushmen. South of this line is the so-called police zone, the developed territory with its towns and civilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In World War I the military forces of the Union of South Africa under Generals Louis Botha and Jan Christiaan Smuts captured the territory, the Germans surrendering July 9,1915. Then on December 17, 1920, the League of Nations granted the Union of South Africa the mandate over the territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Development</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Under the administration of the Union of South Africa, which became the Republic of South Africa in 1961, the territory’s economy has flourished. This land of cattle and karakul, of fisheries and guano, copper and diamonds, has also many other resources. The central plateau is splendid cattle country. In the dry south flourish the karakul sheep, the “black diamonds.” Four million of them feed the world’s fashion markets with fur and aid the land's economy by some $17,000,000 yearly. The barren Namib contributes its rich diamond yield. The land’s economy, based on commerce, industry, mining and agriculture, is sound, its products command good prices and its trade balance is favorable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Although the territory has as yet no universities, it progresses educationally. The Basters have good schooling, with high school facilities at Rehoboth. Some of these people are rich farmers, and this national group has done much for its own education. In the tribal areas there are several hundred schools, providing, however, mainly primary education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Political Development</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Pointing to the future of South-West Africa, President Woodrow Wilson of the United States said during the Versailles Peace Conference: “It is the task of the Union of South Africa to make it so attractive that South-West Africa will of its own free will want to become part of the Union.” How have matters developed in this regard?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The existing pattern was retained, the territory north of the Red Line still being closed to Europeans, .who must have a permit to enter this area. The Union Parliament, however, legislated several constitutional changes. In 1925, for Instance, provision was made for creating and giving executive power to an Administrator and a Legislative Assembly. The territory’s Legislative Assembly resolved in 1934 by a two-thirds majority in favor of a change of status of the territory to a part of the Union. In 1943, and again in 1945, it resolved unanimously that the territory be incorporated with the Union.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A referendum was held by the territory from December, 1945, to April, 1946, in cooperation with its mandatary to test the feelings of its then nearly 300,000 nonwhites. The result was 70 percent in favor and 11 percent against joining the Union, while 19 percent were not consulted, the wandering Bushmen and certain others not being accessible as national units. The Hereros, forming 7 percent of the territory’s total and 11 percent of its Bantu population, were most strongly opposed, and still are today. They wanted “their land” back, under the protection of the Trusteeship Council.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Mandate and Dispute</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">At the foundation meeting of the U.N. in 1945, South Africa asked for the termination of the mandate and that the territory be incorporated with the Union. The request was rejected. The following year the U.N. requested the South African government to submit a trusteeship agreement for the mandated territory, to replace the mandate of the defunct League. The Union government informed the U.N. in 1947 that it would not submit the requested trusteeship agreement because of “the wish, clearly expressed by the overwhelming majority of all the native races in South-West Africa, and by unanimous vote of the European representatives of the territory&quot; and that “in the existing circumstances the Union government has no alternative but to maintain the status quo and to continue to administer the territory in the spirit of the existing mandate.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The U.N. had rejected the result of the referendum on the ground that the nonwhite population could hardly have realized what the referendum was about, although the representatives of these people declared that they had understood well and that they wanted to continue under the Union government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In 1948 the Union of South Africa again rejected the U.N.’s request to place the disputed territory under a U.N. trusteeship. The following year, the association of the two countries, already close, was made much closer when South Africa gave the territory six elected representatives In the Union house of assembly and four in the senate. Thus the territory is today administered virtually as a fifth province of the Republic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">When the U.N. requested the International Court of Justice for an advisory opinion on whether South Africa could legally absorb the area, the World Court ruled that the provisions of the U.N. Charter do not bind South Africa legally to put the territory under the Trusteeship system, but that South Africa can change the territory’s international status only with U.N. approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In June, 1961, the U.N. special committee on South-West Africa was to visit the territory, but the Committee was denied entrance into the disputed area. Nonetheless, the Committee submitted a report, based on testimony collected from witnesses in other parts of Africa. The Committee’s report recommended that South Africa’s mandate be terminated immediately and that the U.N. establish an interim administration. An Afro-Asian resolution was then approved by the U.N. General Assembly, which called to a seven-man mission to visit South-West Africa with the task of arranging with South Africa for general elections </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">leading to the</span><span class="font14"> independence of the disputed territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">U.N. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Visit Leads to Controversy</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">South Africa, taking the view that the mandate, granted after World War 1, lapsed with the dissolution of the League, did not admit the full U.N. committee into the territory. During May, 1962, however, South Africa invited Victorio D. Carpio of the Philippines and Dr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Salvador Martinez de Alva of Mexico, the chairman and vicechairman of the U.N. seven-nation SouthWest Africa Committee, to come to the disputed territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The U.N. officials went on a tour of South-West Africa. Wishes of those consulted ranged from requests for U.N. supervision to satisfaction with the present system and the desire that the U.N. not interfere. After the tour a lengthy statement was issued by the U.N, officials in Pretoria on May 26, in which they stated that they found no evidence nor heard allegations that there was a threat to international peace and security within South-West Africa. The </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">report, in effect, </span><span class="font14">absolved South Africa of the accusation that its racial policies threatened the peace in the territory or the annihilation of its nonwhite population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Two weeks abyer the Pretoria statement, which was greeted with considerable anger by a number of African delegates, Carpio disavowed any hand in its preparation. He insisted that he was ill at the time and was under undue persuasion to approve it. Dr. Martinez, however, said that both men had agreed on every part and that for his own part he did not deny the statement and that he still believed it was accurate.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">Out of the controversy emerged a new report, apparently coming from the same U.N. officials, the tone of which was quite a contrast with the declaration made in Pretoria by the two officials and endorsed by the South African government. The new statement said the racial situation in South-West Africa was a violation of the U.N. Charter and “the enlightened conscience of mankind.” It said it was “the overwhelming desire” of the African population that the U.N. take over the administration of South-West Africa and that the U.N. might consider sanctions against South Africa to compel her to heed the U.N.’s wishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Then, on August 31, the full U.N. Committee on South-West Africa issued a statement saying that &quot;a serious political disaster with far-reaching consequences” threatened the disputed territory. It said it was “imperative” that the U.N. “take firm and resolute action” to gain its rights in South-West Africa. Yet it cannot be denied that the U.N. has failed to inspire confidence by the conflicting reports of its representatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">What is ahead for the disputed territory? Observers of African affairs will watch events with keen interest, knowing that there are no easy answers for territorial disputes, which are rooted in the fact that men tend to be strongly nationalistic rather than feeling ties of brotherhood with other races. Only when men everywhere show tolerance and love for their neighbor will territorial disputes be a thing of the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">CANADA’S CONFUSING ELECTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By "Awake!" correspondent in Canada</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">D</span><span class="font13">UNE 18, 1962, was election day In Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, whose Progressive-Conservative party had been in power since 1957, submitted his administration's record to the electorate and asked for a renewal for the next four years of his mandate to govern. But abyer the votes were counted there remained considerable confusion. None of the four contending parties had gained a clear majority. The Progressive-Conservatives had won 116 seats; the Liberals 100; the Social Credit 30; and the New Democratic party 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The election day, hailed as the 'day of decision,’ had turned out to be the 'day of indecision.’ The Canadian people seemed disillusioned with the Dlefenbaker government, but not at all convinced that any of the other political groups had anything better to offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Although no party had a clear majority in the 265-seat House of Commons, Diefenbaker as leader of the largest party would have the task of forming a new government. But such government could only rule on sufferance of the other parties, which could at any time defeat the minority government and force a new election. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Maclean’s</span><span class="font13"> magazine, a prominent Canadian journal, described the result as a &quot;Hung Jury,&quot; and added sadly: &quot;Nobody had won; Canada had lost.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But what does this division of parties mean to government in Canada? The Conservatives and Liberals are the two old-line parties and are both a little to the right; the New Democratic party is a socialist-labor group. But the item of greatest interest is the emergence of the Social Credit party with 30 seats, 26 from Quebec. Their main spokesman is Real Caou-ette, a French Roman Catholic politician who, when asked, “Who are your political heroes in history?” replied: &quot;Hitler and Mussolini.&quot; It is small wonder there is some disquiet in Canada when a man of this type could hold the balance of power between the older parties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Prior to the election Diefenbaker held a 203-seat majority. At this election eighty-seven of these seats were won by other parties. What caused so many of the Canadian people to transfer their political support?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">During the past four years there has been a continuing problem of unemployment and a slowing of the remarkable economic expansion Canada enjoyed during the immediate postwar years. The government continued a broad spending program, without Imposing sufficient taxation to cover it, and relied on continued borrowing to cover huge deficits. The Canadian people and the Canadian government had been spending more than the country could afford. James Coyne, president of the Bank of Canada, had been fired by Diefenbaker in 1961 for telling the government this unpalatable truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In point of fact, an adverse balance of trade and loss of confidence in the Canadian dollar had caused the withdrawal of much-needed foreign capital and created a financial crisis. The government sought to hide the true situation till abyer the election. Diefenbaker campaigned on the argument that the government had brought prosperity, taxes had been reduced, business was on the upswing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">These brave words began to sound a bit hollow when, on May 31, right in the middle of the election campaign, American dollar reserves fell so low that the government was forced to peg the Canadian dollar at 921c American to prevent its being forced even lower in the world money market. Diefenbaker assured the public this was a planned move, there was no great problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But right abyer the election, Diefenbaker faced the country on TV and announced that there was a major economic crisis, new taxes would be imposed and he would pare $250 million from government spending. He then borrowed over a billion dollars from the International Monetary Fund to bolster Canadian currency. For a man who only a week earlier had been proclaiming prosperity and reduced taxes, it was hard to make this sudden switch convincing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">What is likely to happen now? The strategy for a minority government is to follow a noncontroversial line that is not likely to combine the other parties against it. This leads to timid and ineffective administration. The situation was succinctly described by the Kelowna Courier of British Columbia: &quot;The overall result of the election was disastrous for Canada. There are many major problems which cry to be solved and no minority government can solve them successfully.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">IN THE PHILIPPINES</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">By ‘"Awake!" correspondent in the Philippine Republic</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font24" style="font-variant:small-caps;">D</span><span class="font15" style="font-variant:small-caps;">une</span><span class="font13"> 19,i96i, marked the beginning of happy expectations, as ground</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">was broken for the Watch Tower Society’s new branch office and home in the Philippine Republic. Just seven months later, on January 1, 1962, the elated staff of Branch workers, the Bethel family, occupied the new two-story building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The building’s design, simple and functional for tropical climate, was drawn up by a Witness who is an architect. The office is located on the ground floor, and its area of 1,983 square feet is illuminated by recessed, Indirect lighting. The walls are paneled with a Philippine hardwood called &quot;dao,” which is known for its tastefully subdued natural grain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font13"> high sloped ceiling helps circulation and keeps the room temperature down. Exposed crossbeams on the ceiling give good support and add to the decor. Frosted glass jalousies in aluminum frames make the ten bedrooms on the second floor well lighted and ventilated. The frosted glass helps create a cooler atmosphere in tropical weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The dedication program, set for the weekend </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">at May</span><span class="font13"> 12 and 13, began with a three-part symposium. Brother Alfredo Estepa, a Bethel family member since 1949, pointed out how interest in the Kingdom work had first manifested itself, following a visit by the Watch Tower Society’s first president, Charles T. Russell, to Manila in 1912. A few years later an Englishman arrived in the Philippines to do missionary work for the Watch Tower Society. He organized_a Bible study class in Manila and delivered lectures on Sundays to which the publie was invited. On June 1, 1934, a branch office was established, and by 1939 there were 14 congregations and 159 active ministers. By December 7, 1941, when war </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">broke out in the Pacific, 3-73 Witnesses were reporting service. At war's end </span><span class="font13">more than 2,000 Witnesses were preaching God’s kingdom in the Philippine Islands. The branch office was established in the heart of Manila but quickly proved to be too small; it was later moved to its present location in 1948. At the time there was only one two-story building on the premises. In 1954, with the growth of Jehovah's witnesses here reaching 21,855, a second two-story building was constructed on the Society’s property.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The branch servant continued the symposium by speaking on &quot;Present Expansion Work in the Philippines.” He pointed out that, with 1,029 congregations, 463 isolated groups, 500 special pioneers and an average of more than 2,000 regular and vacation pioneers in the Philippines, the need for a new building to make room for printing operations and larger office Space became evident. The new construction proved timely, especially in view of April’s report of 36,829 Kingdom ministers. The former Office now houses the Kingdom Ministry School.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Then, to the surprise of the 1,550 in attendance, he showed color slides of the new building’s construction in various stages, from the laying of the foundation to its completion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The dedication talk was then given by Brother Salvador Liwag, a faithful sower of the seed of God’s Word throughout the Philippine Islands since the early thirties and a Bethel family member since 1936. He pointed out that Jehovah's witnesses dedicate themselves, not to men, but to the Creator. In dedicating the beautiful new building to Jehovah, he showed, the Witnesses are putting themselves under solemn obligation to use it as an honorable place to Jehovah's praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">On Sunday morning, field ministry was arranged from Bethel. Hundreds of Witnesses called on neighbors in the area to invite them to the public talk that abyernoon. Happily, many responded and 2,099 attended the lecture on a lovely, cloudless Sunday abyernoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Jehovah’s witnesses realize that, not the beauty of the building itself, but their whole-souled Kingdom service will justify its existence, to the glory of God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">II &gt;11 </span><span class="font0">Christian View of </span><span class="font15">J [ </span><span class="font0">Those Who Oppose</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">C</span><span class="font14">HRISTIANITY obyen has been the target of those who oppose. Jesus himself was accused of blasphemy, having a demon and sedition. The early Christians suffered bitter reproach from men who deserted the congregation and became antichrists, (1 John 2:18, 19) Christian beliefs were attacked by critics such as Celsus, who ridiculed them in his writings. All such opposition has not died out with the passing of centuries. As Peter forewarned, ridiculers have appeared in these “last days.” </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(2</span><span class="font14"> Pet. 3:3, 4) Deserters from the modern congregation also manifest themselves, fulfilling Jesus’ prophecy about the “evil slave” class that “beat” their faithful brothers. (Matt. 24:48, 49) Therefore every follower of Jesus should clearly understand the Christian view of those who oppose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The work of Christians is to preach and teach the good news of Jehovah’s kingdom and make disciples of those of goodwill. (Matt. 28:19, 20) When attacked by those who manifest a bitter spirit and lying tongue, a Christian will be careful not to be led into fits of anger, strife or contentions, which are works of the flesh. Rather, he will endeavor to carry on his ministry In a peaceful manner, manifesting kindness, mildness, long-suffering and selfcontrol. Onlookers will be able to discern who it is that has God’s spirit. (Gal. 5: 19-23) Of course, this does not mean that Christians make no defense. They do, depending upon the circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The admonition given by the apostle Peter to fellow Christians is: “Sanctify the Christ as Lord in your hearts, always ready to make a defense before everyone that demands of you a reason for the hope in you, but doing so together with a mild temper and deep respect.” (1 Pet. 3:15) As long as persons are interested in the hope that we cherish, as long as they want proof for the things we believe, it is our responsibility to satisfy them with sound Scriptural answers. But when they demonstrate hatred for the truth, or if they are merely seeking to ridicule the truth, it is not the part of wisdom to endeavor to set them straight. As Proverbs 9:7 says: “He that is correcting the ridiculer is taking to himself dishonor, and he that is giving a reproof to someone wicked—a defect in him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">On one occasion when Paul was preaching in Antioch be encountered opposition from a group of such persons who had no love of the truth. When they tried to get him embroiled in an argument by blasphemously contradicting him, Paul simply stated: “Since you are thrusting it away from you and do not judge yourselves worthy of everlasting life, look! we turn to the nations.” (Acts 13:45, 46) Like Paul, Jehovah’s witnesses today do not waste time with opposers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Of course, this does not keep such opposers from giving vent to their hatred of those who by their preaching of Bible truth are aiding others to gain spiritual freedom. Both the religious clergy and those of the “evil slave” may publicize all manner of half-truths and outright falsehoods about Jehovah’s people, just as religious opposers did in the days of Jesus and his apostles. (Luke 7:34) But does this make it mandatory for Jehovah’s witnesses to turn their attention from their preaching work to the work of refuting all the false charges that are thrown against them? No,</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Jesus Christ himself, when being accused before Pilate, did not deem it necessary to answer the lying charges that were hurled against him. (Matt. 27:11-14) The apostle Paul, too, when all sorts of malicious charges were made against him, simply denied them and said: “Nor can they prove to you the things of which they are accusing me right now,” (Acts 24:13; 25: 8) He did not feel that their lies put him under obligation to produce witnesses to disprove them; rather, it was the responsibility of those who maliciously misrepresented him to produce proof for their charges. But concerning the things that he had done, concerning the things that he did believe and preach, he was ready and willing to bear witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">There is no need to fear that by maintaining this Christian view truth seekers will be caused to stumble over the oppos-ers’ chatter. The activity of Jehovah’s witnesses has not been done in a corner. Not only by word of mouth, but through printed publications in over 150 languages the world has had made available to it information concerning the beliefs and organization of Jehovah’s witnesses. The record is there for sincere inquirers to consult. Furthermore, the meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses held in their Kingdom Halls and in many homes that have been opened for group Bible study are open to the public. If anyone wants to see firsthand what Jehovah’s witnesses do in their meetings, what they teach and how they are trained for the ministry, he is welcome to attend these meetings. This is the way to get the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">As we look beck on the situation that existed in the first century, it can be appreciated that one would not have learned the truth about Jesus Christ from those who opposed him, even though such op-posers were the religious leaders of the nation. Nor would Judas, who forsook Jesus, have been a reliable source of information. Yet Jesus spoke the truth; he was “the Faithful Witness.” (Rev. 1:5) So today, those who really want to find and associate with Jehovah’s faithful witnesses are not going to prove themselves blind to the facts by following guides who are blinded by religious prejudice, only to fall together into the pit. (Matt. 15:14) Rather, as did those who became disciples of Jesus, they will go and see for themselves. They will search the Scriptures to see whether the things these Witnesses preach are really so.—John 1:45-49; Acts 17:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The responsibility of such persons who are searching for the truth is to make sure of all things and hold fast to what is fine. (1 Thess. 5:21) And the responsibility of those who bear the name of God as his witnesses is to act in harmony with the counsel found at 1 Peter 2:12: “Maintain your conduct fine among the nations, that, in the thing in which they are speaking against you as evildoers, they may as a result of your fine works of which they are eyewitnesses glorify God in the day for his inspection.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The present day of Jehovah’s inspection will be climaxed soon by Armageddon. Therefore, it is vital to apply all our energies to .the God-given work of preaching the Kingdom good news, not allowing ourselves to be distracted from this vital work by the misrepresentations of those who oppose. Rather, guided by the Christian attitude toward those who oppose, remember the encouraging words of Jesus: “Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing against you for my sake. Rejoice and leap for joy, since your reward is great in the heavens.”—Matt. 5:11, 12.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Racism in Mississippi</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; On Sunday evening September 30, alter repeated efforts, James H. Meredith was finally admitted to the University of Mississippi campus under the protection of the United States marshals. This touched off a vicious riot that raged throughout the night. By 10 p.m. the rioters had gotten out of control and threatened to overcome the some 320 marshals that had been sent to the campus in anticipation of trouble. A frantic plea was sent to Washington for troops, and by morning 3,000 of them had arrived. During the night, however, two persons were killed and many were injured, some seriously. The government continued to pour in troops until a peak of 14,000 was reached on Tuesday. By force of numbers and equipment the hostile crowds were quelled in their attempts to seize Meredith. However, there is no telling how long he will need to be surrounded by bodyguards as he moves about the Mississippi campus. Several days later, while he walked toward the library, a coed shouted out: “Why doesn’t somebody kill him?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Catholic Ecumenical Council</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; On October 11 the widely publicized twenty-first ecumenical council of the Roman Catholic Church opened amid a lavish display of j pomp and ceremony. Unlike the modest first-century assemblies of Jesus with his apostles, the pope, who claims to be the vicar of Christ on earth, was carried about on an expensive throne of gilded wood and red upholstery by eight men outfitted in uniforms of crimson. And reflecting the close ties of the Catholic church with the political nations, the pope welcomed statesmen and political representatives from eighty governments and six international organizations to a special audience in the Sistine Chapel. The council’s opening sessions in St. Peter’s Basilica were attended by a total of 2,540 &quot;fathers of the council,” including 81 cardinals, nine patriarchs, as well as most of the hierarchy’s archbishops, bishops, abbots and heads of religious orders. Pope John announced that &quot;there is hope that the Ecumenical Council will finish before Christmas’’ but that there might be another session &quot;if we are not able to say all that we would like to in this period.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Religious Backing</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">® Surprising to many persons is the fact that the deplorable attitude of the rioters in Mississippi is backed up by some of the religious organizations of the South. A few days before the campus uprising a convention of the Tri-state Fellowship, a division of the World Baptist Fellowship, drew up a resolution and sent it to Mississippi’s Governor Ross Barnett It said: &quot;We are praying that God will give you strength to be the one governor that will bring this great nation back to the principles of our founding fathers. True Bible believers, North, South, East and West, hold the truth that God divided the races and intended them to remain so. Stand fast and die if necessary for what you believe to be right.”—Peoria, Illinois, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Journal Star,</span><span class="font13"> Sept. 29, 1962.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">U.S. Space Flight</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">•$&gt; On October 3 the United States, for the third time, orbited a man around the globe. Whereas the two previous flights circled the earth only three times, on this occasion six orbits were completed in nine hours and twelve minutes. The flight was reported to be a ' success from the takeoff to the return, which landed Navy Commander Walter M. Schirra, Jr., in the Pacific Ocean within 9,000 yards of the recovery ship. The six-orbit journey of 165,000 miles, however, was still far short of the four-day, 64-orhit trip made by the Russian astronaut Adrian G. Nikolayev on August 11. The United States next plans a seventeenorbit flight sometime in January.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Spanish Flood</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">® On September 26 the </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">worst </span><span class="font13">natural disaster in Spain's modem history struck the Barcelona area in the form of flash floods that wiped out villages and swept bodies out to sea. Hundreds of the dead were recovered. It was believed ■ by officials that the death toll would reach 600.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Negligent Mota</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">On October 1 two former airline stewardesses testified before a </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">United States government</span><span class="font13"> investigating committee that they had been allowed by pilots to fly airplanes filled with passengers. As reported in the New York </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font13"> of September 7 and October 2, Margaret Mary Donofry said that she flew an Eastern Air Lines Constellation from Atlanta, Georgia, to Charlotte, South Carolina, In 1958, and, she confessed: &quot;I don’t even drive an automobile.” Mrs. Margaret Agnes Sweet testified that on a night flight of a Pan American World Airways plane in June of 1955 the captain invited her to take the controls. When she declined she said he insisted, assuring her, &quot;Everyone does it.” Other witnesses also testified that they were allowed to fly commercial airliners or saw others doing so. The investigations were prompted by forty photographs that were turned over to the Federal Aviation Agency on September 6 that purported to show Eastern Air Lines pilots sleeping and reading on duty and stewardesses sitting at the controls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Sea Noisy as Farm</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&amp; Many fish produce sounds that would mask the approach of.an enemy submarine, therefore the Navy is conducting extensive experiments to record the sights and sounds beneath the sea, and then, eventually, to connect each sound with a definite species of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">fish. The</span><span class="font13"> Navy's experimental laboratory located in the Bahamas has found that sounds made by marine life are reminiscent of a farm on a spring morning. There are honks like those of geese, clucking similar to that of hens, hammering like that of woodpeckers, sharp knocks that sound like a man shingling a bam roof and doglike yelp-bark-yelp noises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Opiate or the reopie&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; In mid-September a statement by the United Church of Canada </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">said that many</span><span class="font13"> Communist charges against religion were true, for, it said, throughout history religion obyen has been &quot;an opiate of the people.’’ Not only is this so of religions of the East, the statement stressed, but &quot;religions of the West, too, which bring their people Into the modem world in fear, poverty and superstition are sometimes nothing more than strange caricatures of the early church.”—Saskatoon </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Star Phoenix,</span><span class="font13"> Sept. 19, 1962.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">U.N. Membership Orows</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; On October 8 Algeria was accepted as the 109th member of the rapidly growing United Nations. This raised the African membership in the U.N. to thirty-one, and represented France’s twentieth former Asian and African possession to reach independence and United Nations membership. It was only this past summer that Algeria gained her independence from France abyer a bitter seven years of war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Radar Guide</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; On October 1 a Trans-World Airlines jet flew from New York to London without a professional navigator aboard. It waa the first commercial transatlantic flight to be navigated electronically. The flight was guided all the way by means of electronic beams that were bounced from the plane to the earth and back again. In this way the plane’s exact position could be established in about five seconds, whereas it might take a professional navigator up to fibyeen minutes to fix a plane’s position and plot it on charts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Colored Up</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; “As I traveled home I could feel the eyes of everyone in the bus and on the street turn toward me. But I didn't under-stana wny xney were all looking at me that way until I got home and looked into the mirror. I- almost fainted!” Those were the words of young 32-year-old John O’Toal to his doctors. He is employed as an assistant chemist by the Imperial Chemical Industries of London. Abyer examining the patient, they announced this to be the first such case ever reported. They presumed that chemicals were to blame for the blue tinge of the face, chiefly P-Nitroanilin, which could have attacked him through the skin and affected his blood circulation. The yellow color of the hands was also attributed by doctors to a chemical reaction. The red ears are still a mystery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Status Symbol</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This past summer sociology lecturer John Highet of Glasgow University said that in England, as in America, people have taken up churchgoing as a status symbol. The English, he told the Church Union Summer School of Sociology, obyen go to church &quot;because it’s good </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">for business, polities and one's </span><span class="font13">individual social ranking.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Jordan Keeps Scrolls</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;$■ On September 30 Jordan’s Antiquities Department announced that all Dead Sea scrolls kept in the Palestine Archaeological Museum would be taken over by the Jordan government by the end of October and displayed in the Amman Museum. For several years there had been a question as to whether the scrolls should be nationally or internationally owned, but last February the Palestine museum and the Jordan government agreed that all scrolls found in Jordan should become government property. The $59,000 contributed by foreign organizations and institutions to buy them from the shepherds and Bedouins will be refunded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Traffic Accident In the U.S. </span><span class="font13">$ The National Safety Council reported that 4,000 traffic deaths were recorded In the United States in August, to set a record for that month. It was the tenth consecutive month, the council said, that the number of accidents either equaled or exceeded the total for the corresponding month of the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Record Trout</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This past simmer Orton Flett hauled in a record-size trout from </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Lake </span><span class="font13">Athabasca, which is located in the northern part of the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta, It weighed 102 pounds, nearly 22 pounds more than the previous record catch of 80 pounds </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font13">ounces landed six years previous. The tremendous trout was 50 inches long and 'll inches around, and, by means of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">rings </span><span class="font13">an </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">byt </span><span class="font13">technicians estimated its age at 27 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">German Prosperity</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■&gt; What West German shoemakers term &quot;forgetfulness through prosperity” has resulted in mountains of shoes piling up in their shops. People leave their shoes to be repaired but then never return to pick them up. In Hamburg alone, a recent survey revealed, over 45,000 pairs of shoes are leby each year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Radiation Danger</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Early in September the 2,N, Scientific Committee submitted its second report on the &quot;Effect of Atomic Radiation,&quot; which </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font13">to be considered by the seventeenth session of the General Assembly that opened September 18. In the report over 100 scientists from 13 nations, including the United VAaWA wA X’JMSia, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wife discontinuation of nuclear testing to reduce the radiation hazard. When the first report was drafted in June of 1958, 169 nuclear devices had been tested:. 113 by the United States, ,39 by Russia and 17 by Great Britain. Up to the time of the second report 152 more aerial blasts had been made; 73 by the Russians, 70 by the United States, 5 by Great Britain and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">4</span><span class="font13"> by France, to make a total of 321.</span></p>
