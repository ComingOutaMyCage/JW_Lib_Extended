W®dne««fey, March 7, 1928 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number 221</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Shoes and Leathers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HE first clothing worn by human beings were the bur garments provided for .Adam and Eve. .All tailoring harks back to the shape of the hide and its cutting to the best advantage, Impervious to wind and rain, leather is an ideal material for many uses. The Indians painted their records in books made of fine white deer skin. In Bible times leather was used for clothes, sandals, bottles, harness and books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The most ancient form of foot covering is the sandal. With the ancient Egyptians this was made of plaited grass or papyrus; and straw sandals are this very day worn by millions of people in Central Asia, India, China and Japan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Shoes were first made of leather, and afterward of brass and iron. The Jews had them of linen, rush and wood. Millions of Europeans at the time of the World War were wearing wooden shoes or shoes with wooden soles. Before the World War a pair of clogs could be bought in Holland for 14c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">About the middle of the Fifteenth Century it was stylish to have shoes as long as possible. A knight had shoes eighteen inches long, a baron two feet, while a prince had shoes two and a half feet long. In England at that time the fashions became so extreme that the shoes cumbered the people in walking and to overcome the handicap they were forced to tie the •points of the shoes to their knees. In the reign of Edward IV this was prohibited by law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It will surprise some to learn that the bestwearing shoes in the world are not made of leather but of esparto fibers, still worn in parts of Spain and Portugal. These fibers have the faculty of picking up and retaining in their ii|erstiees stony particles. As fast as the pebbles wear out they are automatically replaced by others. As a consequence of this self-soling process it is not uncommon in Spain and Portugal </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">to find esparto shoes</span><span class="font8"> still in use every day after twenty-five years of wear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Two of the best known artificial leathers are pantasote and fabricord. The method of manufacturing pantasote is a trade secret; but the fabric so closely resembles leather that only an expert can tell the difference. Cotton cloth is the basis of fabricord. This is coated with a tough material and finished to resemble leather,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Hides and Skins</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">^PANNERS use the term 'Tides” to describe the larger and heavier skins of full-grown oxen, horses and other large animals. The lighter skins, from calves, goats, sheep, etc., are known in the trade by the name “skins”. The most important hides are those of oxen, used exclusively in the making of sole and belting leather. Goat and kid skins come next in order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hides and skins come chiefly from North America, South America, the East Indies, Australia and New Zealand. Newark, New Jersey, is a tanning center, having among its interesting industries of this class one establishment devoted exclusively to curing the skins of the walrus, shark and porpoise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The tanner recognizes every hide or skin as composed of three parts: the outer or epidermis, including the hair; the inner fleshy or fatty layer; and the layer between them, which is the one of which the leather is made. His problem is first to get rid of the hair and flesh and then to fill the central layer with curative preservative material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are many ways of removing the hair and fat. One way is to lay the hides in limewater from two to twenty days; then the hides are scraped both inside and out until nothing is left but the fibrous portion. The tanning is done by immersion in a vat containing a liquor</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">355 .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">strongly impregnated with tannin. The best tanning takes eight to ten months, after which the skins are shaved on the flesh side to uniform thickness and tumbled into-a mixture of oil, soap and tallow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hides of any kind can be turned into glue by boiling. In an unprepared or moist condition they are readily disintegrated; and if dried raw they become hard, horny and intractable. Tanning overcomes the tendency to putrefaction, secures suppleness, renders it impervious to water, increases its strength and its power to resist wear and tear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Various Kinds of Leathers</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">O</span><span class="font8">IL-TANNED leather is leather in which the tanning- bath is omitted. The skins are pounded, rolled and pressed in oil until every particle of animal matter capable of putrefaction has been driven out and replaced by the preservative oils of the whale or cod. Chamois is an oil-tanned leather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Parchment is made from the skin of a sheep from which the flesh and hair have been removed in the usual manner. It is then stretched on. a frame, and the putrefying matter which it contains is absorbed by powdered chalk, after which the surface is smoothed with pumice and scraped. The skin is then dried and smoothed into shape. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Patent leather is made by splitting a skin into thin layers and coating them with a varnish of linseed oil containing some coloring matter. Well tanned leather is flexible, soft, tough, and proof against bacteria. .But any leather which, is exposed to moisture and left in a dark place in that condition will mold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The United States leads the world in leather production, using about 19.000,000 hides yearly, of which almost half are imported. There are now so many good leather substitutes, and there is so little walking done, and so little harness used, that the demand for leather is lessening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Itinerant Shoemaker</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">TN COLONIAL times the shoemaker was an -®- itinerant, going from house to house, living as one of the family until he had shod the whole family for a year ahead. Each person, had his own last. Up to the middle of the Nineteenth Century all shoes were made entirely by hand. The term of apprenticeship was seven years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Today there are very fow of these export shoemakers to be found. It takes about two-days for one of them to make a pair of slices. Now most shoes are machine made, fiftytoi machines being used in the process, and each shoe passes through the hands of 108 operators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The United States claims to lead the world in quantity and quality production of shoes.; Brooklyn, N. Y. has become the leading center for ladies’ high grade shoes. In a recent test fi in a modern American factory a pair of shoes ■ which required forty-two machines and fifty- . seven operators to finish was completely finished in thirteen minutes. The labor cost in a pair of $3.50 shoes is about 60c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Shoe Styles and Prices .</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">N</span><span class="font8">OVELTY shoes are expensive to make, because of the new patterns, dies and lasts, and when the style passes away the shoes, originally priced as high as $10 at retail, are apt, to be found on the bargain counter in six months at $1.98.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Shoes with high. heels lose their attractive appearance and their serviceability much more quickly than those with common sense heels. Heels placed in the middle of the foot cause ex-eessive strains on seams and uneven, wear on. soles and uppers. High-heeled shoes have been the cause of innumerable accidents and untimely deaths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Force your feet into shoes that are too short or too narrow and you will have earned and will receive in due time corns, bunions, over-riding or hammer toes, fallen arches, callouses and aches and pains to suit, and in time the bones of your foot will become deformed. The woman who wears well-fitted shoes with broad low heels and roomy toes is well paid for her good judgment, and it may be added that women are wearing larger shoes today than ever before and are more sensible today than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">No one expects that liigh-toppeei shoes for women will ever cgme back into style; and it is-even predicted that high-topped shoes for men will also pass away, the use of woolen stockings making them unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Leather wears better if it is smooth-finished than if it is embossed. Grain leather wears better than split leather. In grain leather the many fine hair holes of the skin are apparent critical examination. The darker shades</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">dyed russet leather give the best service. Light colored leather hay have been bleached by chemicals to its detriment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Care of Leather Goods</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19280307_files/g_E_19280307-2.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:19pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">ASTOR oil or vaseline may he used for traveling bags, suit cases and upholstered leather; but glazed, enameled and coated leathers thus treated are ruined. Special dressings may be purchased for such leathers. Castor oil rubbed lightly into the shoes with flue palm of the hand greatly increases the endurance of the leather. Any oil will darken light-colored or russet leather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Soiled leather may be cleaned with soap and sponge. Oxalic acid injures the leather, (treat care is necessary in drying wet shoes as wet leather will burn when it gets hotter than the hand can bear and then it is ruined. To dry wet shoes wash them in tepid water, correct the shape, put shoe trees in them,, or stuff them with' dry paper crumpled and set them in a moderately warm (but never in a hot) place until thoroughly dry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Leather articles kept in very warm places soon crack and become harsh, and easily scuffed. Kept in damp places they mildew. It is economy to have two pairs of shoes and wear them on alternate days so that they can get thoroughly dry between wearings. Wet shoes wear out in a short time. Soles and heels wear away rapidly and stitches cut through easily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Shoes in need of repair should be repaired at once and not after the welt has been worn through and the shoe ruined. A handy man with the aid of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font8"> mail order repair kit can put in new heels, rubber heels, half soles, etc., without much difficulty. Waxed linen or flax thread should always be used for sewing, as it is so much, more durable than cotton. The wax makes the thread more water-resistant and the stitch holes more impervious to water.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">HE City of Elkins, West Virginia, in its charter and ordinances, No. 129, makes a distinction between its beggars. No hungry or homeless man may beg in the city of Elkins without a permit from the Mayor; but a provision is inserted that “'this chapter shall not relate to churches soliciting salaries and expenses or anything else for the good of the churches within said city”. Wonder how that discrimination between hungry beggars and religious beggars looks at the bar of Almighty God. Is it likely that the religious beggars are His favorites and the hungry ones are taboo? If so, there is not a thing in the Bible to indicate it. Where did the Lord of heaven and earth ever ask anybody to go into the begging business on His account, anyway?</span></p>

The seven editors of the little book are men of national repute and the work is dispassionately done. No true American can read it without hanging his head for shame that such, a miscarriage of justice could take place.in this country. The men were executed because they were anarchists, but when officials disregard justice to bring about murder they are the worst kind of anarchists themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">How the Beacon Light Operates </span><span class="font8">rpiIE New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Tinies</span><span class="font8"> tells us that two New -*■ Haven Protestant clergymen have made public addresses recently in which they said &quot;that it was time that men and women of their faith realized that the Catholic Church was not a .menace, but a beacon light of civilization and religion” and that, in effect, they hope that the next President will be a Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are two ways of operating a beacon light. One is to make a bonfire of those who disagree with you; and if this is the sense in which these two “protestants” see the Catholic Church as operating a beacon light, then we do not see how anybody can disagree with them. But that is not what they meant. They are probably expecting that Al Smith is going to be the. next President and are doing what they can to-stand in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Is Aluminum a Poison? An Opinion</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HIS question has been so positively answered in the affirmative by so many scientific men that we may as well record permanently iu our minds the word “ YES” and then proceed to find out what this means to the public. If aluminum is a poison it can be harmful to people only if it is ingested, and no one would be tempted to swallow even a single dose of the salts of aluminum if aware of its poisonous nature. But millions of people daily ingest quantities of this sort of substance not knowing of its presence in their foods or how it got there. And so it seems advisable to bring to the attention of my readers the ways in which the compounds of aluminum may enter the foods upon which, they live and thus become poisoned, slowly or suddenly, consciously or unconsciously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">No information has so startled the whole public in recent years as the reports of investigators that aluminum cooking utensils have been suspected of causing people who have eaten foods prepared therein to be poisoned. I believe no more important question confronts the public than this: “Are you poisoning yourselves by the use of aluminum cooking ware and of baking powders containing alum (aluminum) F If so, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">why don’t you quit it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Comparatively few people are intelligent on the subject of what their foods are doing to their health. However, there is a growing interest in this question and the search for truth or dependable knowledge becomes more and more diligent. Many lights and sidelights have been thrown upon the screen; but they have had more to do with specific types or kinds of food and their general preparation than with their exact composition or the utensils in which they are cooked. Credit should be given to the many honest, competent teachers in the field of nutrition and health for the useful facts they have given to humanity, often in spite of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">ridicule </span><span class="font8">and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">discrediting</span><span class="font8"> by </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">orthodox professionals</span><span class="font8"> who really ought to have been the leaders of thought in. the direction of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">exact facts</span><span class="font8"> as to foods and their effects upon human life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But it seems to have been left for this writer to bring to general public attention the question of aluminum poisoning and to explain wherein it seems to him that the chief danger lies and how to escape it. To this task he has devoteed many years of study and experimentation, com-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. Charles T. Betts, Toledo, Ohio</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">mencing with a suspicion that the use of aluminum ware in his own home was, to some extent at least, the cause of his own broken health and finding that his abandonment of the use thereof seemed to contribute to his recovery and later abiding good health. Much opposition has arisen to his theory, as might, be expected; for huge commercial interests are affected by the opinion of the public in such a matter as this, and persons of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">high position</span><span class="font8"> have undertaken without submitting any convincing </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">proof, </span><span class="font8">to induce the public to take none too seriously any such condemnation of utensils so generally used as those made of uZiwninum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The fact that aluminum ware is used in a great majority of American homes does not at all prove that the public has a favorable opinion, now that the question is raised; for the number of people who have abandoned their whole sets of such ware indicates that they were </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">victims</span><span class="font8"> of a lack of knowledge of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">effects</span><span class="font8"> of the use thereof, rather than that they had any fixed conviction that there are no possible harmful effects. But the presumption is that only a few users of aluminum ware have really given any serious thought to the matter and that they are innocently employing such ware without having any reason to suspect that it may be unwise to do so. This writer's purpose is mainly to raise the question so that all thoughtful people may get the fa.cts and become qualified to decide safely and wisely with reference to their health security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For bventy years or more aluminum kitchenware has come into more and more extensive use. Why should it be otherwise? Is it not ideal in many respects? Or would it not be ideal, if this question of aluminum poisoning had not arisen? If the use of such ware involves no health danger, then indeed w’ould it not properly be considered ideal for its purpose? But if it </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">contaminates</span><span class="font8"> foods or becomes </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">ingested</span><span class="font8"> in foods cooked in it with </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">poisonous effects,</span><span class="font8"> a serious problem confronts the user. If any injurious effects upon the foods thus cooked occur; or if </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">food values</span><span class="font8"> are reduced or the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">vidamines damaged</span><span class="font8"> or </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">destroyed; or</span><span class="font8"> if no </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">harm </span><span class="font8">to the human body results from eating foods thus prepared; or if the color of food is not changed to indicate </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">adverse chemical changes </span><span class="font8">in it; or if there is not in reality </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">any ingestion </span><span class="font8">(ff aluminum metal by reason of cooking in alu-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">minum ware; then tins question about possible aluminum poisoning should never have been raised at all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And so, whatever may have been the impression of the average user of aluminum ware; whatever his attitude to the question that is now raised it will never be downed until </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">all of the facts are known by all of the people.</span><span class="font8"> Whatever resentment any one may feel because of the suggestion that he ought to look well into this matter lest he may have made a serious mistake of judgment with reference to the employment of aluminum 'ware and alum bakingpowders in his home, the facts ought to be frankly ascertained and action consistent therewith taken. This writer’s purpose is not to condemn aluminum, but to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">safeguard human health; </span><span class="font8">and the only way anybody’s health can be protected is by avoiding mistakes which cause harm to the body. If the reader will think without prejudice and then act wisely in this as in all matters affecting health, he will contribute just that much to personal comfort, success and. longlife and will do much to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">induce others to do the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Aluminum dissolves readily from cooking dishes.</span><span class="font8"> To prove this, boil ordinary drinking water in an aluminum dish for half an hour and immediately pour this boiled water into a clear glass container. The aluminum compounds will be clearly visible to the naked eye. Examination of the aluminum dish after the experiment will not disclose any perceptible loss of metal therefrom; but it should be understood that the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">activity of the metal</span><span class="font8"> is such that you will see in the glass container about </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">a thousand times as great volume</span><span class="font8"> of aluminum hydroxide as of the metal lost from the dish in which the water was boiled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">in this form</span><span class="font8"> that the metal enters the body with food and is digested and taken directly into the blood circulation by absorption. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">In this form</span><span class="font8"> also the metal could be taken into the circulation by injection if such form of medication were resorted to before major operations. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">In this form</span><span class="font8"> the metal is a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">catalyst.</span><span class="font8"> It acts upon all living tissue with wTiieli it comes in contact, itself remaining unchanged. The body strives to rid itself of such an element and to throw it into the intestines for elimination. A normally healthy body can thus dispose of much of such poison, but when one is subnormal and resorts to medication for bowel action, the aluminum poisons are apt to be reabsorbed into the blood and follow the circulation again. This may become a persistent or habitual operation, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">causing continual poisoning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Cancers and ulcers occur in some and not in other members of the same family, although they claim to eat very much' the same foods. Persistent aluminum poisoning may seem to produce these symptoms in certain people of various localities and not in others.. Perhaps some resort to cathartics and others do not. It will be found, I believe, that those most susceptible to aluminum poisoning and who ingest foods containing aluminum will usually be found to be regular </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">dependents upon cathartics; </span><span class="font8">and I believe such, are particularly subject to physical breakdown of the parts attacked by aluminum. This process or theory is graphically described by Dr. Victor Vaughn. Dr. Vaughn was Dean of the Medical Department of the University of Michigan for thirty years and held the presidency of the Medical Association for six years. lie is recognized as one of the nation’s riiost </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">prominent medical authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1900, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">even before Dr. Mallett’s work,</span><span class="font5"> 1 said that aluminum must be absorbed: and testifying before a Senate Coramitrce I testified that it would be difficult for all of the alum to escape absorption. .My conclusion is that the salts of aluminum are </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">harmful in the human body. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I say, most of these poisons by absorption are carried by the blood and the lymphs to every part of the body. It does not have to go to every part of the body, and they have opportunity to be brought in. contact with all the features of the body; and as I have stated here in this definition, they have their </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">selective action;</span><span class="font5"> they will </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">combine</span><span class="font5"> with certain tissues, other tissues they will </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font5"> combine with. They may </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">add</span><span class="font5"> something foreign; and they may </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">take something away; they may merely rearrange the structure of ike living tissue.</span><span class="font5"> By either one of these means, they may </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">harm</span><span class="font5"> the tissue. Then the body strives to get rid of these things by eliminating them and pouring them back into the intestines, and they may then be </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">reabsorbed again, and may go around.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Q. Now, Doctor, in. the testimony to which you have referred as having been given by you </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">in the, year 1900, </span><span class="font5">before the Senate Committee of manufacturers, at </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font5">hearing in Washington, did you come to the conclusion as a result of your studies and experiments up to that time that the salts </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">of aluminum are harmful in human food?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Thai was my conclusion, Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Q. And did you ernne to Hie further conclusion that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">tUllin baking powders</span><span class="font5"> were not healthful, and not whole-OB^fwhen used in the preparation of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">human food?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">' A. Z </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">did-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">.The opinion above quoted is a description of a caneer-forming substance. The Doctor perfectly describes but does not define it as such. ■The 'reader can judge for himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">?ui-ch investigation has been made by various scientists regarding the action of aluminum compounds upon the digestive tract and it is of great benefit to mankind, in my judgment, that Dr. Harry Gideon Wells, Pathologist of the University of Chicago, explains why some people are sufferers from aluminum compounds while others are not apparently affected by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Action of Aluminum Compounds on Cells Lining the Digestive Tract.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Aluminum, compounds, being protoplasmic poisons, wi; poison the endothelial cells of the digestive tract. (These are the cells which line the digestive tract and come in immediate contact with food and drink.) They not. only have the function of lining the tract, but a very important function in protecting the rest of the body. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Poisons of great potency might enter the digestive tract in large quantities and be prevented from causing any harm to remote tissues as long as these endothelial cells are uninjured, but if injured, this defense is lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is &quot;tny belief that one’s vitality is either raised or lowered, according to the health condition of the endothelial cells.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Doctor Wells has reached a further conclusion that aluminum compounds have a serious action upon the reproductive organs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Action Upon Reproductive Organs. Sterility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In my opinion, the effect of aluminum compounds, the passing into the human system by absorption </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">would make, themselves felt in ike reproductive organs.</span><span class="font5"> The cells of these organs are particularly sensitive to the ••action of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">any poisonous substance,</span><span class="font5"> and often show </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ina-l-rd changes</span><span class="font5"> when changes in other parts of the body are undiscoverable even by careful micrpscopic studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">. Dr. Wells’ Conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Iffy opinion is that aluminum compounds are poisonous to all forms of life, including the higher animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The above opinion regarding aluminum ft in ■harmony with that of many prominent medical and scientific authorities, such as Cowper-th'Ai’Jtc, Burt, Spofforth, Dr. Wm. Gies, Hattie .Heft. Maxwell Karshan, Dr. Philip B. Hawk, Dr. Clarence A. Smith and many others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">.And this is an important question: Are food values destroyed and are foods made injurious by aluminum compounds? It is my opinion that no one should eat foods cooked in aluminum. But this is not alone my opinion; for many prominent medical authorities hold similarly. Among these is no less an authority than Dr. Wm. F. Koch, of Detroit, Michigan, founder of the Koch Cancer Foundation. He is quoted in the Los Angeles </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font8"> of May 22, 1927^writing in an interview or article on “Koch Diet”, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another possible source of chronic poisoning is aluminum. Cooking utensils made of this metal are in almost, universal use and. quantities of baking powder containing salts of aluminum are exposed for sale in our shops. A few months ago we thought that quite </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font5">discovery had been made when it was- found that all foods </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">cooked in aluminum receptacles greatly increased the cancer reactions,</span><span class="font5"> and even water boiled in an aluminum dish </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">behaved similarly.</span><span class="font5"> All </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">baking powder</span><span class="font5"> containing alum compounds had the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">same effect;</span><span class="font5"> they were inimical to the cancer patient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Perhaps this particular action with respect to cancer has not before been published, but recently I have found a small work, An </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Opinion Upon Aluminum,</span><span class="font5"> by Dr. Charles T. Betts of Toledo, Ohio, that conclusively shows aluminum to be one of the great sources of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">chronic poisoning.</span><span class="font5"> Dr. Betts computes that the average person whose food is cooked in aluminum ware, and whose bread is baked with an alum baking powder, consumes four to five grains of aluminum salts at each meal, or twelve to fifteen grams per day, and this every day in the year. If this is one of the sources of chronic poisoning which is cancer-producing, can we wonder that tins disease is increasing by leaps and bounds? Can we expect our treatment to be highly effective while </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">these causes are active?</span><span class="font5"> I think not. The conclusion is obvious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dr. W. A. Dewey, Secretary of the Koch Cancer Foundation, is quoted in the October, 1926, Koch Cancer Foundation </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin,</span><span class="font8"> as follows :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The interfering features most commonly met with that obstruct the development of immunity have been, discussed previously as X-ray, radium, metals such as colloidal gold, mercury, arsenic, etc. An important interfering metallic agency </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">not hereto</span><span class="font5"> discussed and. associated with the diet, is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">aluminum. ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Aluminum is dissolved very readily by distilled water or ordinary water from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">aluminum cooking utensils</span><span class="font5"> and in such quantities as cause </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">interference with recovery. </span><span class="font5">Foods likewise, when cooked in aluminum ware dissolve out large quantities of aluminum and for this reason it is. necessary to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">avoid,</span><span class="font5"> aluminum dishes and utensils in the preparation of the food for </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">cancer patient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If food cooked in aluminum ware is made either valueless or capable of causing injury if ingested in the case of a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">cancer patient, how can </span><span class="font8">such food be beneficial to or safe for consumption by a person who </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">does not</span><span class="font8"> have cancer? If a cancer patient can not </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">get well</span><span class="font8"> if he continues to eat foods cooked in aluminum ware, or foods which otherwise contain aluminum compounds, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">hoiv can a healthy person</span><span class="font8"> hope to keep well if he </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">persists in consuming</span><span class="font8"> such food?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Scientific records give in detail statements regarding the effects of aluminum compounds on vitamines. The following is the opinion of Dr. Albert P. Matthews, Professor at the College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Actiox on Vitamines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Probably a more serious result will be that it [aluminum] will unite with various essential constituents of 1 he food present in small quantities, substances called food accessory substances, or vitamines, and these substances will be thereby so changed as no longer to exert their usual action on the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In animals, and on a restricted diet having barely sufficient of these substances to support the life of ite tissues, a very serious condition will be produced in the alimentary canal, owing to the lack of these essential substances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Action on Intestine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This condition will be very similar to the conditions described by Chittenden and Underhill as a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">pelagrous condition.</span><span class="font5"> There will be </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">hemorrhagic condition of the intestine</span><span class="font5"> with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ulceration of the duodenum and at times of the stomach also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Action after Absorption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The aluminum from such residues after absorption into the blood and lymph will exert the usual action of aluminum salts </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">on the tissues and organs of the body, this action being more or less severe depending on the quantity of aluminum absorbed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Regardless of absorption, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">aluminum can exert an irritating action on the mucosa of the gastro-intestinal tract without absorption; and in the manner already stated it may exert the deleterious action on the food, so changing its quality as no longer to exert the nourishing effect it would have exerted in the absence of aluminum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The scientific side of any question is apt to be given too little attention by the laity. But there is a practical side that is clearly within the capacity of every person to comprehend. Health is a personal or individual matter and depends wholly upon what one does for or to himself in all matters of body management! One can elect to continue to use aluminum ware and to consume alum baking powders. This is his privilege. One can elect to discontinue their use, too. This may be his duty. It surely is, if this writers opinions are even </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">approximately correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But object lessons are often needed. Often in newspapers are reported cases of group poisonings, people made desperately sick at banquets, dinner parties, etc. Such reports have come from various parts of the country. Hundreds ot persons made violently ill from eating foods most carefully selected and prepared by their own people for some public gathering, turning joy into </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">shock</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">grief</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">anxiety </span><span class="font8">and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">death.</span><span class="font8"> So often have these events included the preparation in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">aluminum ware</span><span class="font8"> of the food served that suspicion naturally attaches to this incidental fact. Sometimes the food is merely </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">stored</span><span class="font8"> for a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">long period</span><span class="font8"> in aluminum. Sometimes it is also cooked in aluminum. Occasionally, as in the case reported in the following story printed in the Pittsburgh </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Sun-Telegraph, </span><span class="font8">it may be' that </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">only part</span><span class="font8"> of the food is contaminated by aluminum poison and poisons the rest by being mixed with it. Giving account of a very serious and extensive poisoning which occurred at the First Baptist Church at Punxsutawney, Pa., on December 3,1927, the following appeared:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">200 </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Church Diners Poisoned</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Punxsutawney, Pa., Dec. 3.-—Two hundred people, who attended a chicken supper at the First Baptist Church, today are recovering from ptomaine poisoning. A dozen or more are seriously ill, but so far there have been no deaths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Women of the church prepared the supper at their homes and served it in the church auditorium, and every person who partook of the supper became ill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Physicians stated</span><span class="font5"> that the entire supply of gravy had been poisoned, as the, result of one of the women, leaving the gravy in an </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">aluminum container too long</span><span class="font5"> before taking it to the church. All the gravy was collected into one container to heat and in that way the entire supply was contaminated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Rev. E. L. Safford is pastor of the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another typical case of group poisoning was reported in the daily papers in February, 1927. A parent-teachers banquet was served in Kansas City, at which more than 150 persons Weg|| poisoned. The foods had been cooked and stored in aluminum ware and physicians 'diagnosed the poisoning as due to mineral acid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Baltimore, Md., on November 28, 1927, at the “Wedding of Miss Eva Sandel to Mr. Louis Kabuchnick, more than 100 guests required medical attention by reason of food poisoning, of a sudden and mysterious nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In St. Louis, at the Home of the Blind, April 8, 1927, seventeen persons were poisoned in a mysterious way from the food, one victim failing to recover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Gold, Pa., Mr. and Mrs. Charles Baker died, after eating food cooked and left standing in aluminum ware.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Toledo </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Blade,</span><span class="font8"> December 12,1927, reports the death of one person and the critical condition of three others—another mysterious poisoning case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We may not look for hearty support for antialuminum opinions through the press, for aluminum cooking ware and alum baking powders are extensively used, advertised and are carried by many stores. Evidence has been plentiful that such observations and experiments as this writer has made and the opinion he has reached on this subject are not welcome in the daily press column. Pro-aluminum propaganda may be more fortunate in its reception for publication. As an instance of the attitude of one 86-page newspaper, the managing editor was removed from his position a few hours after he allowed to be </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">reported</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">printed</span><span class="font8"> in that newspaper an article on this subject prepared by this writer; and I am informed that he was told frankly that his discharge was for that reason. The writer considered that the dismissal of such a prominent newspaper editor for such a purpose was equal to the death of another prominent editor—Don Mallett of Canton, Ohio—by an assassin’s bullet, when he </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">dared to print </span><span class="font8">what he considered </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">worthy of public knowledge. </span><span class="font8">Such acts are, in my opinion, direct attempts to strike at the very </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">foundation</span><span class="font8"> of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">basic principles</span><span class="font8"> upon which our Government is founded.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">8g Preaching to the Chief of Police </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By R. II. Barber</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HINKING that this might be of assistance to some who are chased by a policeman while canvassing on Sunday, I am submitting the following experience, which occurred in the city of Gloversville, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I was canvassing a well-to-do residential section, and at the first house approached, a fine-looking lady met me at the door, and as I began my canvass she began to back up, leaving the door open, and then turned and ran to the rear of the hall, leaving me standing there alone. Nothing remained for me to do but to try the next house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the fourth house a gentleman, with a pious face and more pious manner, was telling me that he resented my attempting to sell him anything on Sunday, and I was pointing out to him that he was reading a newspaper which he had purchased on Sunday, and that the clergy delivered their sermons on Sunday, and collected their pay on.Sunday, when he remarked: “There is some one motioning to you.” Looking around I observed a gentleman, in a fine limousine, motioning to me to come to the car.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I stepped down the stairs and up to the car. He threw open the door and said: “What are you selling?” I answered: “Are you the chief of police?” “Yes,” he replied, “some one called up and said a party was selling books on Sunday.” “Well,” I answered, “that person was mistaken; I am not selling booksI am preaching the gospel. You know Sunday is a day set apart for preaching the gospel, and there are different ways of preaching the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The Salvation Army get some drums and other tom-toms, and make a lot of noise, and gather a crowd around them on the street corners and harangue them there and take up collections ; and that is their way of preaching the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Others build large church buildings costing several hundreds of thousands of dollars, adorn them with fancy windows, tapestries, pipe-organs, and cushioned pews, and then invite you to leave the comforts of your home and come down to the church to hear the preacher give a so-called sermon, after which they pass the collection box and collect their pay, and then solicit subscriptions for their church papers— all on Sunday, too. More than that they do it for profit and, dying, leave an estate to their family. This is their method of preaching the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“'Our method is to print the truth about the plan of God and to explain the meaning of the texts of the Bible in books and booklets [here I spread out on the seat beside him all the books and booklets I had] and then go from house to house on the day set apart for preaching the gospel—on Sunday—and sell these bocks, which contain several sermons each, at cost of production of the books. We are not making money on them, a nd we are not leaving an estate to our children either. Now, I would like to sell you a set of these books.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Although I gave him a complete canvass, while he listened in silence, I could not make the sale. I urged him to accept the combination as a gift from me, telling him that he would find some zealous Sunday school teacher or preacher would probably call him up again and complain, and that he ought to know just what the books contain. I stated further, that there were probably 10,000 Bible Students selling these books all over the world today, and have been selling them on Sunday for months, and would continue to sell them, as there was no law against preaching the gospel on Sunday, and that is the very purpose of setting apart that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“If others want to build costly buildings with costly equipment, and beg the money to do it, and if still others want to parade and drum up a crowd to hear their message, we do not object; this, however, is our method, and there is no objection to it, is there?” He only answered: “I don’t know what they called me up for,” and drove away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Kingdom Witness in Latvia </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Rees Taylor</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HE kingdom message, our Lord told us, must be given in all the world for a witness. In 1926 we opened up for the beginning of this witness in Latvia. Up until the year 1918 Latvia was a part of Russia in common with Es-thonia and Lithuania, the other two Baltic States. This naturally made it nearly impossible for a witness to be given there earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Since the Declaration of Independence, it has been a good deal easier to get about things in the country. But even now nearly all the government officials seem to be permeated with the spirit of old Russia, and very specially the police. As in old Russia, the police are extremely powerful and the people still have quite a dread of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Like most of the new nations that arose out of the Avar, Latvia has no money, with the result that things are very bad in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Trade is in a very bad condition, and the unemployment problem is a serious one. In Riga it is quite an exception to see a factory chimney showing any signs of activity. And in the other towns the impression that one gets is that they are absolutely dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Once, at Liban, the former arsenal of Russia and a town that has quite a large port, I saw only one ship in the harbor. I was told just recently that at times there has been no ship at all in the harbor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Wages are very low, and consequently the standard of living is also low’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In September we held the first three publie meeting’s, in the three largest towns, Riga, Li-bau, Mitau. We have to obtain permission from the police to hold every meeting. Up till now this has not been at all difficult to get, but the procedure is really very amusing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At one series of seven -meetings of which we will speak Is ter, the procedure in each town was absolutely different from the last. .Ip fact, I have cnme to the conclusion that they know very little about- their own law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J n one town the police chief had been a military attache in London, and he told me that it was not really necessary to get permission at all, but that we just had to notify them that a meet-</span><span class="font4">'ing </span><span class="font8">was going to be held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When I first arrived in Riga, I tried to buy </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font8">book containing the law of the land. At the very best book shop in Riga they told me that I could not get anything in Lettish, but that virtually we were still living under the old Russian law.' I have noticed as well that all the works of reference in the police stations are in the Russian language. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These first three meetings were held in the German language, as up to the present time we have no books in the Lettish language. The people speak three languages, Lettish, German and Russian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Devil tried ven- hard to stop these meetings, but he was not successful. In all, 975 attended these three meetings and as a result just 600 books were sold. The people were deeply interested indeed and demanded that we should have further meetings and studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One of the leading lights among the clergy of Rigs was so alarmed at the appearance of the Bible Students, that he threatened to excommunicate anybody that came to 'our meeting. During the meeting I told the people of this and they seemed to be much amused at the idea of being exconnnun icated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Libau, the second town, the clergy also got busy and issued some pamphlets telling the people not to buy our book's, and telling them that we did not believe in Jesus Christ. They do not seem to mind to what lying they go, as long as -they can stop a few people from coming to the meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After these meetings they attacked us very strongly in the leading church newspaper. But it was remarkable to notice that not on any'one occasion did they attack the truth doctrines, but always some side issues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">---Then- in. October we had </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font8">series of seven meetings and the experiences at these meetings </span><span class="font4">were </span><span class="font8">really inspiring. Although all the meettugs were? German meetings, and that fact was dearly stated on all our advertising matter, about 1.700 Letts who could, not speak a word of German were so interested in our message that they turned up at these meetings and had to go home again. In all eases they were very insistent that we should come back and have meetings in Lettish. We are hoping soon to receive some Lettish books from; 'the factory of the Watch Tower Bible fc Tra-eti Society, and then </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">we</span><span class="font8"> shall be able to take the witness to these people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was remarkable to see the disappointment on their faces as the poor people had to go home without hearing the message. Many of them hung about the doors in the faint hope that they would be able to understand something of what was said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After we had held the first two meetings of this series the weather changed and the day of the third meeting it- snowed nearly all day. But the attendances did not seem to suffer very much. And then for the remainder of the meetings we had to distribute our advertising matter in the snow. But when it is a case of the kingdom witness going out, the weather does not make very much difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In every town we found, the German people much interested in what we had to' say, <sub>s</sub> and in each town they wanted us to stop and tell them, more about, these things. And they told us of other towns that we must visit, as they said that the people were waiting to hear a message like ours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the last meeting of the series we had. an illustration of the great interest of the people.. 'When we arrived at the hall about an hour before the meeting we found that they had completely forgotten that they had let the-hall </span><span class="font4">to </span><span class="font8">us, and that they had the decorators in. We hurriedly procured a very large room where we had the meeting. And for about one hour and a half the people stood absolutely still—there were no seats to be had—and the interest on their faces was something worth while watching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Once or twice somebody made a small noise and they were immediately silenced by the people, w’ho apparently did not want to miss a single word of what we said. At this meeting only about a. hundred could get into the meeting, but we sold 105 books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At one town we had an amusing little incident. A lady eame to the book table and. taking hold of Volume 1 of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures </span><span class="font8">asked who the author was. I told her that the author was Pastor Russell, and immediately she said that she would not take one of </span><span class="font4">his </span><span class="font8">books. This is the first lecture that has been hold in this town, but she had already heard of the truth. So I showed her </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God </span><span class="font8">and said that it was written by Judge Rutherford, and. she took it quite willingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">About two weeks after the meetings I made application for permission to stop in the country for a further period of time, and when I went to get my passport the next day I was .told that my permission was refused. The next day 1 went to speak with the Minister of the Interior, and he said that they did not want me in the country and. that I could stop there only until January 10 of this year. They would allow’ me to stop if I would cease rny activities for- the I. B. S. A. or I could stop if the Lutheran churches particularly asked that I could stop (Of course they would be very likely to do that!). But the gentleman seemed to overlook the fact that I had a visa from London, that gives me permission to visit the country for as many times as I like in one year, no one journey to exceed two months. So that means that I can visit Latvia six times each year, and on each occasion for two months, that is just twelve months in the year. All it means is that every two months I shall have to make a journey over the frontier and then come back again and make another visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A short time after this I applied for the hall that we have already twice used in Riga. As soon as the man heard that we were the Bible Students he said that the church people had made difficulties, as we were always pulling them to pieces. So we hired a hall immediately opposite to it. Then we also fixed out two.halls for follow-up meetings, and just two hours before the first one, although we had paid for the hall, they said that we could not have it. ’Then when the time came round for the second i'ol-low-up meeting we went to the hall but the caretaker refused to let us in. This is a shining example as to how the Devil’s organization keeps its word, and endeavors to obstruct the message of truth from going forward. We learned afterward that a certain D. D. had a lot to do with the last hall, so that would explain why we did not get it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then a few days after the meeting the loading German paper came out with the wonderful discovery that the Bible Students were in reality Bolsheviks! There seems no limit to the lies mid misrepresentation to which the .Devil and his servants will go when they are trying to stop the message of truth from going forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In a month or two we hope to have the Lettish books and then we can make a bigger assault than ever upon the organization of the Devil in this part of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The people have been kept in bondage and oppression for many hundreds of years, but the time has come for them to know the truth of God. The people are anxious to hear the truth; and although their leaders can try to do what, they will, this battle is the Lord’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The laborers in the field here are extremely small in number, and we pray the great Lord of harvest that he will send forth more laborers to help us in this wonderful work of witnessing to the incoming kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The Establishment of the World</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Part 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[Broadcast from Station WBBR, New York, by Judge Rutherford. 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">T </span><span class="font8">AST Sunday we had under eonsideratioa -i-J the establishment of the world. Today we eonttaue the same, subject matter. In the former lecture ws saw that, the new heaven will consist of Christ Jesus and His glorified body mem-fersi Christis the kingdom or ruling power and WiH: always<sup>-</sup> be invisible to man. Then we considered some proof that Christ will have on earth faithful men to represent Him and. that these will include Abraham and others of like precious- faith. Now let us consider some further Scriptural proof to this end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Corroborative Proof</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">L</span><span class="font8">ET each one settle it in his mind for all time that God is true. When He makes a promise it is absolutely certain that that promise will be fulfilled. He has never failed in one of His promises, and all of them are good. The psalmist says concerning Jehovah: “Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.” (Psalm 1-19:160) “The testimony of the Lord is sure.” (Psalm 19:7) “For all the promises of God in him are yea [sure], and in him Amen [trustworthy, sure, verity], unto the glory of God by us.” (2 Corinthians 1:20) Jesus says concerning the Word of God: “Thy word is truth.” (John 17:17) And again He said: “He that sent me is true.” (John 7: 28) It is “'impossible for God to lie”. (Hebrews 6:18) God changes not. (Malachi 3:6) “I. have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.” (Isaiah 46:11) “'So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it. shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.”—Isa. 55:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Faith means to know God’s promises and then to rely upon them. He who has faith in God must know that God will fulfil every one of His promises. Having this settled then, note some of the promises of God to these faithful men #f old, above mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To Abraham God promised that He would make of him a great nation. “And in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.” (Genesis 12:2, 3) Again, God promised Abraham to give him all the land that he saw. “And the Lord said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift tip now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever. And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered. Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.”— Genesis 13:14-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In another form He made this same promise: “And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.”—Gen. 17:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Abraham was one-hundred seventy-five years old he died, without having possessed any of the land which God promised to give him. Long thereafter Stephen testified concerning Abraham, as it is recorded in the Scrip ures: “'Then came he out of the land of the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Charraii: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into tins land, wherein ye now dwell. And he [God] veve him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.”—Acts 7:4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Long ago were these promises made. They have not yet been fulfilled. They must be fulfilled in God’s due time; and the Apostle Paul under inspiration writes that God’s due time is after Christ has taken unto Himself His power and begun His reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Afterward when Jacob had left his father Isaac’s home to journey into another’ land, lie slept on a hill in Palestine. “'And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.” (Genesis 28:12) There must be some significance in this vision of the angels ascending and descending on a ladder between heaven and earth, which the Lord permitted him to see. It must represent communication between heaven and-earth. It is reasonable therefore to conclude that the Lord intended here to suggest that sometime He would establish communication be-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">tween the invisible and the visible parts of His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the same time He made this promise to Jacob: “And, behold, the Lord stood above it, and said, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.” (Genesis 28:13, 14) Afterward Jacob journeyed into Egypt and lived and died there. He had not yet possessed this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Their Resur red ion</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HESE promises made to Abraham and to</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jacob, and to their seed after them who died, could not be fulfilled unless God has made provision for their resurrection. The Scriptures show that God did hold out to them the hope of a resurrection, and that Abraham, Jacob and the prophets of ,pld believed in the resurrection. Testifying concerning the hope and the resurrection Job said: “For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: and though, after my skin, worms destoy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see G-od.” (Job 19: 25, 26) Again in Job, looking to the time of the restoration of man, faith in the resurrection is expressed. We read: “If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness; then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom. His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he shall return to the days of his youth.”—Job 33: 23-25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Moses was one of the prophets of God, and one who the Apostle Paul says will be rewarded with a place in the earthly organization of the kingdom; and Moses wrote concerning the resurrection: “The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken. ... I wall raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.” —Deuteronomy 18:15, 18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Samuel, one of the prophets and one of the approved ones of God, testified his faith in the resurrection when he recorded these words: “The Lord killeth, and maketh alive: he bring-eth down to the grave, and bringeth up.”—1 Samuel 2:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">David, another approved one of God, prophesied that God would provide redemption and resurrection for the human race. He had faith therein. (Psalms 91:14; 21:4) Furthermore he said: “For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him. But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me.” (Psalm 49:17, 15) It was David who prophesied that the world in the future should be established that it could not be moved.—Psalm 96:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Isaiah is one of the approved prophets, and lie testified his faith in the resurrection when he wrote: ‘''And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called, The way of holiness ; the unclean shall not ppss over it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein. No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there: but the redeemed shall walk there. And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.”—Isaiah 35: 8-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Again God, speaking through Isaiah the prophet, declared that the earth is made for man and that man shall inhabit it; and since He promised the land to Abraham and Jacob and their seed, it is to be expected that they will receive it.—Isaiah 45:12, 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jesus testified concerning the resurrection of all the dead, and His testimony of necessity must include Abraham and all the faithful ones mentioned by the Apostle Paul: “Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection by judgment.” -—John 5: 28, 29, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These faithful men of old, who for identification are called heroes of faith or ancient worthies, did good and all of them received a good report from Jehovah; therefore they come clearly within the ranks of those mentioned by the Lord Jesus as having a resurrection to hfe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">AVe must conclude therefore from these texts that all these faithful men mentioned by the Apostle Paul, </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a-,</span><span class="font8"> ho are promised a part in the ■;pew<sub>:</sub> government, will have a resurrection which will be better* than the resurrection that will be received by men in general. By this is meant that these will come forth from the tomb with life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The pious -&quot;Jewish clergy of Jesus’ day expected to be a part of the Messianic kingdom. Its fact lhs-y were so egotistical that they did not think Messiah could set up His kingdom without them; and when Jesus rebuked them and did not select any of them to be His disciples they of course thought that He was not wtbrfhyi to be considered the representative of Jehovah, much less the Messiah. He said to them, however: &quot;There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, mid Isaac. and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of.God, and you yourselves thrust out.” (Luke- .13:28) On another occasion Jesus “Many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham., and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.”—Matthew 8:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The new government of earth is the kingdom of heaven, because the authority proceeds from the throne of God and is administered through the King whom God has set upon His holy throne. (Psalm 2:6) The authority that these earthly princes will execute will proceed from the invisible part of the kingdom. They will be the representatives of the Lord on earth, consequently they will be in the earthly part of this heavenly kingdom; and .many others shall come from various parts of the earth and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and these other faithful men. They will sit at their feet and learn wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is reasonable to expect that these faithful men, whom we call ancient worthies, will be brought fortli from the tomb as perfect men, possessing perfect bodies and perfect minds. They were tried and tested before they died. Their faithfulness to the Lord is even held forth to file church as a proper example and guide for those to follow who hope to be of the heavenly or invisible part of the kingdom. (Hebrews 12:1-3) They have received a good report from. Jehovah because of their faithfulness, therefore they have &quot;done good” within the meaning of the term as used by Christ Jo-sus, and in the resurrection they will &quot;'come forth” to life. (John 5:28, 29) Being perfect men, and being princes or rulers in the earth, they will be able to wonderfully encourage the people to strive to prove their faithfulness unto God that they may merit the blessings that He has promised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When God had selected David and anointed him as king He said concerning him: “I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfill all. my will.” (Acts 13: 22) Why was David a man after God’s own heart? Without doubt the reason is found in the fact that David was always loyal and faithful to God. He made mistakes as do other men,, but his heart was always right; that is to say, his motive or purpose was correct. He desired to honor God, and did his best to do so. He loved God and proved his love by devoting himself to God’s service. David was specifically mentioned by Paul as one of the faithful men who received God’s approval. It is reasonable to think of him as one who will have some tremendous part in the affairs of earth during the reign of the Messiah. The' Lord, speaking concerning Israel and those who shall come under the terms of the new government during the reign, of Christ, said: &quot;And I the Lord will he their God, and my servant David a prince among them: I the Lord have spoken it.”— Ezekiel 34: 24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Law for the People</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font8">HAT law will govern the people during the reign of Messiah.’ Will they continue to eb-ct legislative bodies, emu.-t and enforce laws? If everybody did that which is ri-mt no jaw would he needed. Laws are not made for those who Jo good, Mu to restrain tJ&gt;os.&gt; v/I.r, do wrong. &quot;Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly-and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for man-AKydikt’f dr wh®</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">themselves with mankind, for menstoak'-rs, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound dud H ne.” right he done and prohibiting that which is no wrong, no law would be required. However, the peoph* &lt;11 be imperfect daring Messiahs reign. The reign of Messiah will be required to bring back mankind to perfection. The imperfect man therefore will need laws or rules of action to direct, him. But imperfect man will not make the laws for this new government, as has been the custom in times past. The new government will be a pure theocracy. It will be God’s government, conducted in His appointed way, to wit, by and through His beloved Son Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“And he shall rule them with a rod of iron.” (Revelation 2:27) A rod-of-iron rule means a positive, emphatic enforcement of the law. The .unruly will be compelled to obey. The Lord will compel no one to accept the ransom sacrifice and live, but He will not permit any one to do harm in all His holy kingdom. (Isaiah 11:9) Those who attempt to do wrong will be swiftly dealt with in the Lord’s appointed way. But how could men know what is the right thing to do, since they will still be imperfect?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God will make a covenant for the benefit of man. This is called the new covenant. At Mount Sinai God made a covenant with Israel, and that covenant pointed out what the people must do in order to live. Moses was the mediator of that covenant. The Jews could not keep that covenant, however, because they were imperfect and because their mediator was imperfect. The Mediator, of the new covenant will be Christ, of whom Moses was drtype. The Mediator of the new covenant, being perfect, possesses the power to do for man what man can not do for himself. The people will be required to do the best they can to advance toward righteousness; and Christ, the Mediator of the new covenant, will make up for them what they can not do. Their good deeds will be rewarded with progress. Their evil deeds will receive instant punishment. Concerning the new covenant that God purposes to make for the guidance of the peoples of earth during the reign of Messiah, Paul quotes from Jeremiah 31:31-34:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I ’will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah: not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord. For this is the cove*:! nant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will. put. my laws into their mind, and write them in .their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people: and they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">man </span><span class="font8">his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest. For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.”—Hebrews 8: 8-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The first law covenant was typical of the new covenant. That old covenant served to teach the Jews, and all men, that no man can obtain life without the aid of Christ. It also served to lead to Christ such of the Jews as obeyed it to the best of their ability, and who desired to accept Him as king. A few accepted Him; the others rejected Him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That old covenant sets forth in detail the statutes by which the people were to be governed in order to go in the right way. The fundamental law of God, as a basis for the statutes of the covenant, is set forth in Deuteronomy 5: 1-21. The statutes and judgments are set forth in detail in Deuteronomy, chapters twelve to twenty-eight inclusive. It is reasonable to expect that in the new covenant which God will make with Israel, and through them with and for the benefit of all the other nations of the earth, He will set forth the laws or rules of action by which the people shall be governed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the present time we find many, men who are endeavoring to discover a properly balanced food. The-re are many food experts now<sup>7</sup>, and it is commendable that they are trying to find proper diet. It shows that the minds of such investigators are turned in. the right direction. Without doubt in due time the 'Lord will show the people what is a properly balanced diet for humanity, how they should oat and what they should eat. In the fourteenth chapter of Deuteronomy God gave to the Jews under the old law covenant detailed instructions concerning the preparation of food for their sustenance. He surely will do as much, and more, during the reign of the perfect Mediator Christ, the King of glory. _</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Apostle Paul says: “Now the end of to? commandment is love out of a pure he.-'u.. of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned. ’ (1 Timothy 1:5) “Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.” (.Romans 13:10) Now with reference to what the Lord says about the nev<sup>T</sup> covenant, we iiote.tliat these are His words: “For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and-1 will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.”-—Hebrews 8:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The heart is the seat of affection. The heart likewise symbolically represents man’s motive. When the law of God, which is righteous, resides in the heart of man, his course of action will be right. This being true, then love, which is the perfect expression of unselfishness, will be the complete fulfilment of the law. Selfishness has always governed the people during Satan’s regime. The work of Christ will be to establish love in the hearts of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jcavs</span><span class="font8"> were God’s chosen people. He used them to teach lessons to all mankind. They were imperfect like other men. The Devil overreached them and turned them away from God; hence they Avere cast away from God’s favor. The Jews have suffered long, but now their warfare is ended. (Isaiah 40:1, 2) As they return in faith to God He will have mercy upon them. Paul himself was once a Jew<sup>7</sup>, but learning that Jesus is Christ the Messiah he fully devoted himself to the Lord and was transferred from the covenant of Moses into Christ. He Avas 'then made the special ambassador to the Gentiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God’s favor came to the Gentiles when Cornelius received the gospel, and when God opened the way to permit Gentiles to consecrate themselves unto Him with a view to being of the heavenly kingdom class. The. Gentiles then, seeing that the Jews had been cast away, became heady and were in great danger of not receiving their favor from God. Paul, addressing a message to them, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that, blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in. And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob: for this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins. As concerning the gospel, they are enemies </span><span class="font4">for </span><span class="font8">your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father’s sakes. For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief : even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy. For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.”— Romans 11:25-32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Paul’s argument is that the Jews had been cast away and that this afforded an opportunity for the Gentiles to be among the elect; and that when this election is over, the Jews shall believe on the Lord God and He will make with them a new covenant. Then the apostle says in substance that if the casting away of the Jews furnished this opportunity for the Gentiles to be reconciled to God, through Jesus Christ, then the receiving of the Jews back into God’s favor will be life from the dead for the world. That will mean that under the terms of the new covenant all who obey will be completely delivered from the enemy death. “Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness? . . . For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?”—Romans 11:12, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With the Devil’s organization destroyed, the Devil himself bound, the faithful worthies of old resurrected as perfect men and made princes in the earth and receiving their instructions from the invisible King of glory, then and there the great and wonderful new nation, the kingdom of righteousness, the royal priesthood, will be performing fully the function of government both in heaven and in earth, looking to the full and complete deliverance of mankind from their difficulties and imperfections and the bringing of all back into complete harmony with God. With the new heavens and the new earth in full operation, then will fully come to pass the words of the prophet, that the world is established firmly for ever and can never be moved. This new world will be administered in righteousness, and will result in bringing righteousness to the people, granting unto the righteous ones a realization of their heart’s sincere desire.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Cast of debaters: John, a good boy, a church member, very conservative. Thomas, - a soldier of fortune, widely* traveled and widely-read man. Paul, an up-to-date Bible Student, a cousin of the oilier two, a visitor. <sup>:</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The scene .is legated hit a fireside on. Staten island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">TOWN:</span><span class="font8"> Glad to see you again, Paul, I sup-pose tonight you are going to give us the answer to Tom’s qnesiwi about the heathen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&lt; ■ 2’ho»iu&gt;sp That’s right, Patil. I still, want-to know what has become of the heathen of the last g&lt;-n?ral:.»n, Neves- .mind ahoni. ti e preseut ones, or the past ones. IVben you can toll me definitely what has become o£ the one thousand million heathen of the generation which has most recently died, I think I can figure out for myself what, will became of those now living, and of all the generations that have gone before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font8"> Maybe you could and maybe you couldn’t. You might figure it out all right for the past generations that have gone to heli, hut you must remember that we are better equipped </span><span class="font4">now </span><span class="font8">to save the heathen than we ever were before, and you do not know but we may be able to save most of those now living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Thoma.?:</span><span class="font8"> Ok, yes I do! Al the rate yon are going now you would never get them saved in a million years. Yon have not scratched the surface of the real problem of getting the heathen saved. But let us hear what Paul has</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paul: I</span><span class="font8"> am glad to know that, you two agree. It sounded to me as if you disagreed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font8"> We do. lie thinks the heathen are just about to be saved by the present machinery of missions ami I have sec-?: the riixtiHov ami I know better. What I mn anxious to get L your view of t&lt;? u=a! = ?i’. You parffidly exj kiin-v] it the last time you were here, but T could not get down to the kernel of the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font8"> J. do not like to rush this thing too much. I want you to do some careful thinking about the questions involved. Let me ask you a few more questions. They will help bring the different factors to light and then we shall know how to.look-for an answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ts tinlcSl</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font8"> Very well. I will take </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font8"> concrete ex-, ample and ask you to reason on. it. I presume</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">not have exactly what you might call a fine nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font8"> Ila! Ha! That is a good one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">bo some that are not so very fine, but we must not forget that the Russians are Christians, </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font8">Christian nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas (sarcastically):</span><span class="font8"> Oh! Is that so?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font8"> I did not mean to get you two boys after one another’s scalps again, but I was thinking of something that happened in Man&gt; churia at the time the Russians seized the railroad from Harbin to Port Arthur, something like twenty years ago. I was reading the his» tory of the Russo-Chinese war and I ran upon this' item. It seems that the Russians resented the presence of numerous Chinese in what they regarded as strictly Russian territory, so they led five thousand Chinese to a point on the Amur River several miles from town, at a place where the river was a mile wide, and ordered, men, women and children to cross to the other side. There was no bridge, the waters were over the heads of even the men, but the Russians drove them into the chilly waters, and if they attempted to turn back clubbed them to death. Not one of the whole number of five thousand Chinese escaped with his life. Now the question I wish to ask is, What do you think became of these heathen the moment they lost consciousness? Did they go to heaven or to hell?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font8"> That, is the very question I am trying to get you to answer. The view of many intelligent men with whom I have, talked on this subject is that those poor fellows are in the same predicament as everybody else, that there is no hereafter and neither they nor anybody else will ever live again. But that does not satisfy either my mind or my heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font8"> Nor mine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font8"> Nor mine either, I am glad to say. What do you say to the proposition that when they died they went straight to heaven ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font8"> I see difficulties in the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font8"> What difficulties? I just want to see what your arguments are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font8"> Why, if those poor Chinese went straight to heaven, then there should be nothing to keep any other Chinese or any other heathen out of heaven, and the place would be so overrun with billions of the ignorant, degraded and depraved that a saint would be a hundred times harder to find than now on the earth. If that is the case I 'would far rather stay here, and I do not know but that I would rather stay here anyway. In fact, I think I would.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font8"> Ha! Ha! Of course you would. So would, anybody, and any person who says otherwise is either deceiving himself or trying to deceive somebody else. Man is of the earth, earthy. He is made of the earth and the earth is his natural home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">'John:</span><span class="font8"> But how can we be sure that some of these poor Chinese who v. orc thus cruelly slain did not go to heaven? Some of them, even in their heathenism, may have been as acceptable to God as some of the Russians that slew them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font8"> Without a doubt they were just as acceptable, which means that neither w<sup>T</sup>as acceptable, neither the Russians nor the Chinese. To my mind the Russians that pushed those heathen into the icy waters were worse heathen than the Chinese themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font8"> What other difficulties do you see in the way of these poor Chinese going immediately to heaven, Tom ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font8"> Well, there is your own argument, which yon advanced the last time you were clown here. You showed that the heathen can not be saved through ignorance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paid:</span><span class="font8"> That is right. The apostle says, ‘‘By grace are ye saved through faith..” When the jailer asked, ‘‘What must I do to be saved?” Paul answered him, •‘Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and be baptized and thou shalt be saved.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font8"> And then you also quoted Peter’s statement, that there is none other name under heaven whereby we must be saved than the name of Jesus, and Paul's argument that a man must hear the gospel before he can believe it. You also quoted his question, “How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?&quot; That seems to settle the matter that at least most of the heathen must have the gospel preached to them if they are to be saved, but I think some of them can be saved otherwise</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font8"> If the heathen will be saved through ignorance then it is doing them a colossal wrong to send them preachers, for as it is now only about one in a thousand believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font8"> We might go a step further and ask, Why the expenditure of millions of dollars annually and the sacrifice of many lives of missionaries if the heathen are to be saved anyway?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font8"> Nevertheless it is our duty to send missionaries to the heathen to try to save them. We are not responsible whether they accept the gospel message or not, but w<sup>7</sup>e are in duty bound to do as the Lord commanded, “Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font8"> As a matter of fact, John, these words from the last chapter of Mark’s gospel are omitted by the oldest Greek manuscripts and in any event they have come to have a very different meaning from what the apostles could have understood them to signify. To them it must have meant substantially this: 'I have heretofore confined my own efforts and yours to the Jews, and would not permit you to preach to the Gentiles: but now the Jewish or Law dispensation is at an end: the middle wall of partition between Jews and Gentiles is broken down; and now, therefore, I instruct you to preach the good tidings, without respect to race, to any and every creature vdio has an ear to hear it.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font8"> I was very much interested in what you just said, Paul, and from several different points of view, not only on account of its bearing upon the question of the fate of the heathen, but also because -of the fact that some of these proof texts which are so much relied upon seem not to be in the Scriptures at all. 'How many bogus passages are there in the Bible, anyway?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font8"> I rejoice to express my belief that as the Bible issued from the hand of the Lord, by the month of His holy apostles and prophets, there were no bogus passages in. it, none whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font8"> Then how did they get in?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font8"> They got in just as mistakes get into records today. It is very hard to get copying done with absolute accuracy. It is almost a foregone conclusion that if a clerk is asked to copy a list of words or sentences he will make </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">$n</span><span class="font8"> error of some sort in a small percentage of them, perhaps something like one or two percent. That is the way it was during the dark ages. The monks meant to copy correctly, but many of them were exceedingly limited as to their education, the lights were poor, the writing materials were inferior, the manuscripts they were set to copy were not ahvays easy to read, there wms no punctuation, nor even any division of words, and it is a wonder that there were no more mistakes than there were. The total number of serious errors is very small. Occasionally, it is believed, marginal notes were copied into the duplicates, the copiers not being aware of their unofficial character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font8"> What are some of these passages?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font8"> The entire verses which are spurious are few in number; Matthew’s supposed account about the signs of the weather; Mark’s account of the worm that dies not and the five that is not quenched and the last twelve verses of his gospel; Luke’s account of the bloody sweat; John’s story of the angel that troubled the waters, of the woman that was taken in adultery, and the j . last verse of his gospel, about the world itself not being able to contain the books that could be written about Jesus’ words and deeds duringYY= the three and one-half years of his ministry;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">and Philip’s supposed response to the eunuen. ' Thus there are 'only ten passages which contain so much as an entire spurious verse; but there are quite a number of spurious clauses, about a hundred altogether. The reason I mentioned that the command to go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature is spurious is that I never like to use a spurious verse to prove anything by. I presume you both know that the doctrine of the “trinity” rests wholly on a spurious passage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">John (sharply):</span><span class="font8"> What is that you say?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font8"> He said that the doctrine of the “trinity” rests wholly on a spurious passage. I have heard that statement made before. What passage is that?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font8"> It is those portions of 1 John 5:7,8 which have 'to do with the heavenly witnesses and their testimony, the part which says that “there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one.” These words are not in any manuscript of earlier da te than the Seventh, Century and are not in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Version. </span><span class="font8">The words are not given in 112 of the oldest manuscripts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font8"> Are there any other doctrines that are generally held by Christian people that depend upon what you call spurious passages?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paid:</span><span class="font8"> Yes, there is at least one more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font8"> What is that one?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font8"> The very subject we have under discussion. Not only is this passage spurious which commands Christians to go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature, but a very important passage in the book of Revelation which bears on the same subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font8"> What passage is that?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paid:</span><span class="font8"> The last part of Revelation, where it says, “But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished.W;|||| This sentence which would be used by some try to show that the heathen do not have any part nor lot nor any interest in Lis-.-- milu-nmal reign of Christ is not in the Bible originally written.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font8"> Well, then, how does it come that it is in my Bible just as I have it here in front of me?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font8"> My dear Jolin, you have in your hands the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">King James Version</span><span class="font8"> of the Bible, which I cheerfully admit is a good translation of the text which the translators had to work from, but we should remember that the King James translators had only eight manuscripts to work from, none of them antedating the Tenth Century; whereas we now have 700, two of which date from 350 A. D.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font8"> Oh! Now I get you. Youx* point is that the real Bible is the record to go by and that we should not burden ourselves to go by the mistakes of the copyists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font8"> Exactly so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font8"> That appeals to me as the right thing to do, and I wonder that the clergy do not make more effort to let the people know about these things. They must surely know them, do they not?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font8"> Of course they know these things; the educated ones do, anyway; but they are so busy trying to back up the very things that the spurious passages stand for that it would not just suit them to have attention pointed to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font8"> This line of talk rather unsettles my faith, and I would rather get back to the question about w'hat becomes of the heathen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font8"> Well, it does not unsettle </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">my</span><span class="font8"> faith. It makes </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">my</span><span class="font8"> faith stronger in the Bible as the inspired Word of God. I admit that it has shaken out a little more of my faith, in the clergy, but I never did have much faith in them, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">John (angrily):</span><span class="font8"> No; you never did take any interest in the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font8"> Well, you never made it clear to me yet which church is the true church and why it is entitled to my support. I am from Missouri on that question and you have got to show me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font8"> Now, boys! You do not need to get disturbed on these matters. I used to think they had to be settled all in a day or in a very brief time, but now I know’ better and it makes me much happier when I realize that God has all thne at His disposal and He is not excited at all about the outcome of His plan. He has made all necessary provision for the heathen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font8"> It is all very well for you to say that, but you proved to me the last time you were y&amp;wirthat the heathen are all on the road to hell. Now you say all necessary provision has been made for them. To me that doesn’t look like much of a provision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font8"> I should say it is worse than no provision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font8"> There you go again. You always take the contrary side of things. What I meant to say is that Paul gave plenty of evidence which satisfied me that it is our duty to get out and preach the gospel to the heathen, so that they may have the blessings of salvation as well as we Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font8"> Just a minute, now, John. You claim, do you not, that the hearing of the gospel with the natural ear brings condemnation to eternal torment if it is rejected!</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font8"> Well, I know for a fact that most heathen reject the message which the missionaries bring them. Now’ I ask you if that does not prove, according to your own theories, that by the very work which they are doing on behalf of the heathen, the missionaries are keeping them out of heaven? Ha! Ha! I have got you there, John.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font8"> Now, Tom, you know that I do not like the way you put that. You are always doing things like that.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Honoring Earth’s Greatest Hero</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[Radiocast from Station WBBR, New York, by E. -J. Coward.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font8">HILE it was the privilege of Washington to lay the foundation for liberty on the Western Hemisphere and to make possible this great government of the United States, there is yet a greater liberty to be brought to the people of the United States and the world by earth’s greatest. Hero.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We read in John 3:16,17: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This lias been largely the course of the world ever since. The seeds of sin and disobedience sown by Adam have developed, and the entire race has been more and more alienated from their Creator as the centuries have rolled away. The Apostle Paul, in discussing the matter says, “God gave them [mankind] over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not proper.” (Romans 1:28) Thus the Scriptures explain the present condition of the world. God has lot go of mankind during these six thousand years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Some Already Bought Baek </span><span class="font8">Sabbath, also a thousand years in duration. In this Sabbath day it is the divine purpose to lift., the curse resting upon mankind.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Man's Loss of Self-control</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HERE is a very general and natural sentiment amongst men that as individuals we have the right to control ou.rsel.ves, to have an independence of thought and of will; and this is reasonable and right as respects our relationship to our fellow mem Every person should preserve his independence of mind. Whoever lacks this independence of mind and of will is weak and unstable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But there is One to whom we owe everything, even our very existence; to Him we owe, therefore. our full allegiance. The Bible declares that God’s creatures should fully recognize His dominion and control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Looking back to the case of father Adam, we see that God created him with a will, with the power of self-control, and gave him also a knowledge of his responsibility to his Creator. But we see that later he was misled by giving heed to another. First of all mother Eve was misled by giving heed to the adversary, Lucifer, who had deflected from loyalty to his Maker. Then she became the temptress to her husband.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thus the divine law was violated by the father of our race; and God would no longer recognize the one who was unwilling to render obedience to his Creator and to follow His guidance. As our Lord afterward said, “The Father seeketh such to worship him. as worship him in spirit and in truth./’’ When Adam ceased to &quot;worship God in spirit and in truth, God said to him in substance, Won wish to take your owm course; go your way, and see where it will lead you.’</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HE Apostle Paul tells us of some who have have been bought back from this condition of alienation from God, bought back from death. lie says, “Ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your bodies.” (1 Corinthians 6:19,20) Father Adam had sold the whole race under sin. as the apostle explains, under the dominion of Satan. I quote: “For rve know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.” (Romans 7:14). He sold us out in the gratification of his own desires. He involved not only himself but his entire posterity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If, then, the race &quot;was sold under sin to Satan, to whom would the purchase price be paid when mankind is bought back? Would it be paid to the adversary? I answer, No: the adversary never had any right to the human race. They belonged to their Creator. It was His justice which was violated and which demanded the price of man’s redemption, if the race was ever to be delivered from death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The race as a whole are not yet purchased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The price for their deliverance has not yet ■ been applied, even though the purchase price has been furnished in the death of Christ. Mankind are still a race of slaves. The great <sup>1</sup> adversary has taken advantage of .their ignbr-■ anee and superstition due to the fall and has brought them into bondage to errors, weak! nesses, and faults. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ It is God’s purpose, however, that this . slavery shall be only a temporary thing. The , time has seemed long to man, but in God’s sight ■ these six thousand years are as six days. God has a great work-week of six thousand years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The seventh day of this great week is the ■ 376</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">in fiA sev-'-m'th da&gt; the world shall rest from their ov.n Labors and unavailing efforts to effect their own salvation. They shall rest in Christ’s finished <sup>:</sup> work on their behalf. This will be the /great judgment day, the thousand years of Christ’s glorious reign for the blessing of all of Adam’s race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But what about those who are al ready purchased, as suggested by Paul in 1 Corinthians 6:19,20? Those who are first bought are the church of Christ. The price for the salvation of the church is the same price that is necessary for the sins of all mankind. That price is the death of the Lord Jesus Christ, earth’s greatest Hero. The Apostle John declares, “He [Jesus] is the propitiation [victim] for our [the church’s] sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.” —-1 John 2: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The word propitiation means “victim”, the one who takes our place and by means of whom release is obtained. It contains the thought of a substitutionary sacrifice. I quote: “For he hath, made him to be sin. for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.” (2 Corinthians 5:21) Divine justice can offer no objections to releasing the sinners as soon as the purchase price is made available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">How Death Came Upon AU</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">tflflE penalty upon .Adam because of his sin •*- was DEATH; and as by heredity all his posterity have been born blemished and imperfect, they have come under condemnation, though not directly sentenced as was Adam. No doubt God could have placed our first parents under a different penalty. But He wished to give a lesson that would be important not only to the whole world of mankind, but also to the angels of heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is never to be any more sin than God is permitting in this world now. When it is over, there will be no more sin thenceforth in the entire universe. Hence God placed upon man the extreme penalty of His law. Adam could iwver rid himself of that penalty unless he should he redeemed. It would mean his eternal destruction, as well as that of his race, which fell in him. But God has provided redemption. Jesus came to earth a perfect, man, with an unborn race in His loins.. This human life He gave as an exact equivalent fbr Adam and the race yet unborn in his loins at the time of his sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But because of an important feature of His great plan, God purposed that a certain ■•part’ of Adam’s race should have the benefit of the purchase price in advance of the remainder. Paul, in 1 Corinthians/6:19, 20, does'not speak of the world’s purchase, but only that of the church; for only the purchase of the church is yet accomplished. This is the Father’s arrangement. We are told by the inspired apostle that when Jesus ascended up on high, “he appeared in the presence of God for us,” the church.—Hebrews 9: 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was Jehovah’s purpose to have a prepared company to be associated with His Son in His great work for the restoration of the world. This class is called the bride of Christ, the members of His body. As they were sinners, under the same condemnation as the remainder of the world, it was necessary that the merit of Christ’s sacrificial death be first utilized for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Instead of being given actual human -perfection, as will the world during the age to come, these have perfect righteousness imputed to them instantaneously when they accept Christ’s sacrificial work on their behalf and consecrate themselves wholly io God. Thus they are enabled io become joint-sacrificers with their Lord and Head that they may be sharers in His future reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">World Still in the Evil One</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">J</span><span class="font8">ESUS has not yet appeared before the mercy seat in heaven for the world. The Bible declares of the world’s present condition, “The whole world Heth in the evil one.” (1 John 5:19, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">II.</span><span class="font8"> F.) If they had been purchased they would not be lying in the Wicked One. In our .Lord’s last prayer with His disciples before His crucifixion He said, “I pray not for the world, but for them which...thou feast given, me.” (John 17:9) The'next day after lie offered this prayer .He died for all the world, He “tasted death for every man”. (Hebrews 2:9) But He knew that the merit of His death would first affect those whom the Father would give Him out of the world. Hence He prayed in harmony with the Father’s arrangement. To have prayed differently would have been to pray out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the church is glorified with her Lord, then will come the time for Christ to pray for the world. The Bible so declares. The Psalmist David, looking forward to that time, quotes the Father as saying to the Lord Jesus, “Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them with, a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces as a potters vessel.”—Psalm 2:8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Father will then turn over all the nations of the earth to the Lord Jesus. Then the Church, seated with Christ in Has throne, as pointed out in Revelation 3:21, will with Hirn form the kingdom. Jesus shall reign from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth. In due time, and that time is now’ at hand, all the kingdoms and governments of earth are to be brought down to the dust, and the peoples made ready for the heavenly government for which God’s people have so long been praying: “'Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as in heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Earth’s Greatest Hero</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font8">T WAS said of Abraham Lincoln, that “he was the most perfect ruler of men the world has ever seen”. He was truly a noble man, a great hero. But neither Washington nor Lincoln could accomplish for us that which earth’s greatest Hero is going to do. A government in behalf of the people is about to be established which will, swallow up death in victory and remove from our planet earth everything that brings sorrow to the human heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is the government that all nations are really longing for. The prophet wrote of this. I quote: “The desire of all nations shall come.” (Haggai 2:7) In exultant language the Apostle Paul declares that “the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God”.—Romans 8:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Let us now notice briefly the perfect poise of God’s justice and love in dealing with the human race. James tells us that “mercy re-joiceth against judgment”. (James 2:13) If God had permitted man to live on in perfec</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">tion, we can scarcely imagine the tremendous power he would have had by this time. As it is, we see that some of our race in threescore and ten years are able to cultivate such qualities .of mind as to give them an ascendency over their fellows; and were they allowed to live on indefinitely in sin, they would undoubtedly bring all others into captivity to themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Except man should exercise the attributes of his being in harmony with the divine will, he should not be permitted to live, because of the great injury he would do to others. Thus, in the divine arrangements, we see love agreeing with justice that sinful man should die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Again, when our race came under condemnation God might have cut us off more quickly than lie did, had He not in mind the very plan we are no'w considering. Man was to learn certain lessons during the present life, in order that .he might profit by them in the future life. We see, then, that God has arranged a very reasonable and loving way in dealing with the sinner race. In His wonderful purpose He planned to redeem man from this death condition, and to restore the race in due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">All Life’s Experiences Valuable</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19280307_files/g_E_19280307-9.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">LL the experiences of the present life will have a bearing upon the members of the fallen race during the period of their restoration, in the incoming age. God planned that mankind should have experiences of pain and death, thus to learn the needful lessons. For six thousand years the world has been getting its education along the lines of sin: lessons as to what a terrible thing sin is, how hard it is to control, how ruinous are its effects, how hardening of the heart; and that final death will inevitably result from its continued practise. Thus twenty billions of our race have had a schooling time during the past six thousand years. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As we study the matter, we can see great wisdom in God’s course. Love was not indifferent, though for a time God could not show man His interest. As I have pointed out, love had beforehand arranged a plan whereby redemption would come, whereby love would triumph over justice. In God’s due time a purchase price would be given. Then, after justice should reign for six thousand years, during which the world would learn its needed lessons with re;?peet to the heinousness of sin in all its manifold forms, redeeming love should become restoring love, calling mankind forth from the tomb during the thousand-year reign of the great Hero who died for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">’ So, ultimately, v. hen death and hell (the grave) shall have delivered up all that are in them, and when the curse of death shall be no vmore, love will have triumphed over justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thus we read, “0 death, where is thy sting? 0 grave, whore is thy. victory ? . . .Thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.”—1 Corinthians 15: 55-57.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Perfect Poise of Love and Justice</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">rp II IS is one of the most wonderful things we see in the Bible, the. more wonderful as we understand it more. God ahvays maintains His justice and His love; and we are blessed by both. Justice, having triumphed over the world for six thousand years, has brought our race down to s.heol, hades, the tomb. Love in the meantime, began to operate, though in harmony with justice; and it has given the great sacrifice of Jesus, earth’s greatest Hero, and has arranged that at the time of the second advent of Christ, and through His reign of a thousand years, He shall awaken all humanity from the sleep of death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We can thus see in the Bible what a great equalization, or balance, God has arranged. Since twenty thousand millions of souls have sinned, it would, in any other way than God’s way, have required twenty thousand million redeemers. But when we see how God is operating, we wonder at His arrangement. He provided that only one man should be condemned to death, and that through this one man condemnation should come upon all men while still; in his loins. Thus one man could pay the penalty and remove the condemnation from all. “For sines by man [Adam] came death, by man [Jesus] came also the resurrection of the dead.” (1 Corinthians 15:21) One man was a sinner; one man 'was the Redeemer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Beautiful! We never heard of anything like this except in God’s plan. Think of a great ;||Ian,ieovering six thousand years, in which the of twenty billions of human creatures is involved, and yet all so easily and perfectly poised’ Justice will never be cheated out of its dues; yet love gains the victory and vides the way out of the difficulty, and does this at the expense of earth’s great Hero through whom the whole plan is consummated, our blessed Lord Jesus. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Reward of the Hero</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">THE condemnation resting upon mankind -*• was met by the sacrifice of Jesus’ life. But is not that unjust? Oh, no! The Bible assures us that God stated the proposition beforehand to the Son; and that the Son was in full agreement with it, not the man Jesus, but the Logos, the Word, the Messenger, Michael, the Godlike One. The proposition was made to Him that by the purchase of the whole- race of mankind through His sacrifice He might obtain the honor and glory of Me-mah, the oppoiuumty of delivering and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the thousands &gt;■&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">millions of humanity who had come under demnation through the dxobedience of Ab ■ and further, that He should be supremely exalted, even to the divine nature, for all eternity, far above angels, principalities, pow ers and every name that is named. (Philipniens 2:3-11) All this is the great triumph of the conquering Hero, our Lord Jesus. While justice remains for ever inviolate, yet love is the victor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When we see the Bible teaching concerning the Divine Plan, it gives us a confidence in the Bible that we can get from no other quarter. It is the study of the Bible from the outside, by those who try to tear it to shreds, and the employment of their brains -agafhst the Bible, that prove the higher critics and the modernist ministers of our day the worst of all times. Only when we perceive from the inside can we see the strength of the Bible. No human mind ever originated such a plan. It is surely Divine, surely Biblical. We did not discover' it, but it was shown to the faithful in due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">We Know This Pim is of God</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font8">E KNOW that this plan is of God; and the book that contains such a wonderful message is surely the Word of God. It must be that those “holy men of old spake as they were moved by the holy spirit”. The spirit of God indited this wonderful message. The many men, in various times and places, who uttered the words did not know what they meant. The understanding was not then due. But their words constitute a harmonious whole, and the apostle says they “were written for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the world are come”.—1 Peter 1:10-12; 1 Corinthians 10:11; Bomans 15: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I am just thinking at this point that some of my radio audience might have a question in their minds as to how God’s justice will operate toward mankind during the next age. Some may have difficulty in seeing how the world in the future will have their sins forgiven. Will God not hold against the world something for wrongs committed in this life? Will the murderer have the same opportunity as those who have been more noble in their lives ’ How will justice then be represented?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Sc-ripures point out that God’s dealings will be in full harmony with justice; that while love will be especially operative or manifest during the millennial age now at hand, yet justice will never be violated. Will mankind in the future, then, be punished for their sins in the present life ? I answer, Yes and no. They will not be punished in the sense of being legally accountable for sins of the past; for this would nullify the work which Christ accomplished in His death in providing' satisfaction for the sins of believers, this class are no longer legally responsible for them. The same principle will operate with the world in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A Just Recompense of Reward</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ERIIAPS it will make it clearer to our minds if we consider the church of Christ,</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">which is now on trial. Suppose one had lived in such a way as to have gotten himself into a bad condition of body, mind or morals. These things will be more or less as a penalty upon him after he has become a Christian. Although God has forgiven his sins and cleansed him from all unrighteousness, nevertheless such a one will have in his body or in his mind certain natural penalties resulting from his previous sinful course. If he had lived a sinful life for many years, the evil would be so much the more deeply entrenched; and he will have all the greater fight to overcome these deeply imbedded tendencies to sin. One who has lived a conscientious, moral life will have just that much less to overcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But the new age will be a court of equity, in which every extenuating circumstance will be given due consideration. The prophet, writing of this, says, “A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth. He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth.”—Isaiah 42:3,4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">UESTIOX:</span><span class="font8"> If the doctrine of eternal torment is wrong, who is responsible for the error of this doctrine?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font8"> The Devil is primarily responsible. In addition to him, any religious teacher who proposes to be an instructor of the Bible and who preaches this, doctrine is also responsible. There are clergymen, both Catholic and Protestant, who do this very thing. When it is remembered that Satan has the power over the minds of all who do not serve the Lord Jehovah, over all whose hearts are out of accord with the truth as expressed in the Bible, we can readily understand why many teachers of theology are led astray. In 2 Corinthians 4:4 we rear!, “[Satan] the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.” The Devil knows that if he can make men believe that the punishment of the wicked is eternal torment and that God has so planned it, then he, the Devil, can drive the individual away from God. On the other hand the Bible clearly shows that eventually the 'wicked will be cut off from life, they will be destroyed, anc-never more exist. The punishment for the wicked is extinction of being. In Ezekiel 18: 20 we read, “The soul that sinneth, it shall die.&quot; In Psalm 37:10 we read, “Yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.&quot;: Under the kingdom, when the people are placed on trial for life, the record is in Acts 3:23,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;Every soul, which will not hear I hat prophet [Christ Jesus], shall be destroyed (Toin among Ilie people.” The punishment of the wicked is not eternal torment, but. eternal death,</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">2l«.wer,- The Bible highly commends Scripture study by every Christian. It would be a dangerous thing for any Christian to permit another person, even a preacher, to do Iris ahulying and thinking for him. But this is exTimothy 2: 15 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">v:e</span><span class="font8"> road, “Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that ncedeth not to bo ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth/’ Those who study the Bible carefully and apply the word to themselves are approved by God and are able to st ami the trials to which a Chnsban is subject. The individual who does not study the B-bl? is quickly led into error. The early Christians al Berea wore highly commended heeau'se they tested the statements of was speaking the truth, and they searched^ the Bible in order Io do this. In Acts 17:11 we read, “Those were more noIde than those in Tiussalonlca, in thai they received the word wish all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily. whether those things were so.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">that will. God's will is expressed in the Bible. A person can not be a Christian and not study the Bible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Jeremiah and His Message</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[A Juvenile Bible story radiocast from Station WORD, Chicago, by C. D. Nicholson.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font8">BOUT sixty years after the Prophet Isaiah died, a little boy was born in a small town called Anathoth which was located about three miles northeast of Jerusalem. The boy’s name was Jeremiah. His father was a priest who loved the Lord and served Him to the best of his ability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You doubtless remember one of our previous lessons about the terrible condition the Hebrew people got into through the worship of heathen idols and the complete turning away from Jehovah, the God of their fathers. You doubtless also recall that the Lord sent prophets to tell them of their sin and rebellion against the Lord and to warn them of the consequences, but the people refused the messages of these prophets and actually killed many of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jeremiah was born about sixty years before the national sin of Israel reached its climax resulting in the complete overthrow of their nation, the tearing down of their cities and the complete desolation of the land for a period of seventy years at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. Many people who have read the books written by Jeremiah feel sorry for him and say, What a pity that Jeremiah was born at that particular time and that his life was spent in a fruitless effort to revive the faith of the Hebrew people in Jehovah !</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Because of his failure to convert the people back to the Lord, many have concluded that Jeremiah’s life rvas a complete failure. Such people mistakenly think that his message was directed exclusively to the Jewish people, but a careful analysis of his prophecies shows that while addressed to the Jewish people of his time, in reality the Lord was so directing his message that it would apply to our day with even greater force than it did in the days of his own life. If the prophecy of Jeremiah referred exclusively to the people of his day, there would be little use of having his writings in the Bible, and the fact that Jehovah has preserved his writings down to the present time is evidence that they contain a message for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The conditions 'which prevailed among the Israelites w<sup>r</sup>ere very similar to the conditions which now prevail throughout the Christian W’orld. Just as the nation of Israel represented or pictured our Christian world of today, so</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;382</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">did Jeremiah represent or picture </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font8">class </span><span class="font4">of </span><span class="font8">people in the world who are faithfully declaring the message of Jehovah in reference to the early establishment of His kingdomi-dhtiliill Jeremiah was compelled to tell the people that a great time of trouble would come upon them because of their wickedness and they would reap that which they had sown: and those in the world today who are faithful to the Lord are declaring to this generation that a great time of trouble shall come upon the world as a just result or recompense for that which has been sown in.unrighteousness and wickedness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jeremiah’s message was very unpopular with the people because they did not want to hear any message the Lord might send them. They therefore did everything they could to get rid of him and doubtless on many occasions would have killed him; but the Lord„fulfilled His promise to protect him in the face of any danger that might arise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The first twenty-three years of Jeremiah’s ministry were confined to oral speeches and discourses, but finally the time came when he was a prisoner because of his boldness in telling the people the fate which they were to suffer at the hands of the king of Babylon. A written record of his utterances was demanded by King Je-hoiakim. He therefore wrote out many of his prophecies, which were read before the king, who was a very bad king; in fact, he was so bad that the Lord permitted the Israelites to have only one king after him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>;</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The prophecies which Jeremiah had written did not please the king, so after his secretary had read three pages of it, he took a penknife and removed the pages one after another as soon as they were read, and cast them into a fire. In the end the book was completely destroyed. This did not please the Lord, so He spoke to Jeremiah, saying, &quot;Take thee again another roll [or scroll], and write in it all of the former words that ■were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.” Then Jeremiah took another roll and dictated to his secretary, Baruch, all the words of the book which Jehoiakim had burned in the fire,, and added many like words thereto. This*was., the book of Jeremiah which we have in oup-BLi hies even to this day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
