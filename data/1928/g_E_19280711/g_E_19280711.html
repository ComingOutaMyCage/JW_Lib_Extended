Dor the benefit of every subscriber it is here repeated, by way of explanation, that discontinuance of an expired subscription (technically called “deleting'’) is done automatically In every case. The machinery for printing a subscriber’s address on label or wrapper is so devised and constructed that the plate bearing the address is literally “dropped” from the list if the subscriber fails to order renewal of the subscription within five weeks after notice of expiration is sent. A renewal blank (carrying also notice of expiration) is enclosed with the journal one month before the subscription is due to expire. In the ease of foreign subscriptions, the expiration notice is sent two months in advance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Porto Rico — An Overpopulated Paradise</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">O</span><span class="font8">N NOVEMBER 19, 1493, Columbus landed on the western coast of an island which he named San Juan Bautista, but .which we now know as Porto Rico. He found a paradise, an earthly Eden, a land of abundant rainfall, a mild and even climate, pleasant the year around, a land without beasts of prey or wild animals of any kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He found a densely-forested island approximately fifty miles wide by seventy miles long, inhabited by about eighty thousand happy, peaceable, lazy, fine-featured, good-natured red men, who called their island Boriquen. In the ensuing twenty-two years the cruelties of Columbus and his successors had put seventy-five thousand of these natives into their graves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The invaders from the East seized the island, aptly described as the Switzerland of. America, .killed or imprisoned the native chieftains, made slaves of the inhabitants and practised such cruelties that thousands committed suicide or left the island to go anywhere rather than remain subject to such barbarities. These things are not mentioned on “Columbus Day”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The four thousand who were left gradually blended with the invaders, bringing a touch of hopeless resignation to their posterity. ■ The placer deposits where their ancestors worked under the Spanish lash are long since exhausted. The ancient and musical name of Boriquen is no longer heard. “Rich Port,” “Puerto Rico,” came at last to be the name of the land. San 'Juan, the name applied by Columbus, is still the name of the chief city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Porto Rico is fourteen hundred miles from New York, one thousand miles from Havana, and somewhat less than a thousand miles from the Isthmus of Panama. Two lines of mountains, with elevations over three thousand feet, traverse the island from east to west, affording large variety of exquisite panorama. The interior is a high table-land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Porto Rican mountains are peculiar. Each peak, all the way to the top, is composed of innumerable little peaks. Forty-five streams of considerable size find their way to the various coasts. Several of these are navigable for small boats near their mouths.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>A Highly Favored Land</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>r</sup>pH.H hot mineral springs at Coamo are now known to be the “fountain of youth” in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">search for which Ponce de Leon spent his life. So valuable did the natives regard the waters from these springs that they never disclosed their whereabouts to the adventurous Ponce, but sent him on a “wild goose chase” to Florida and the American continent. The most they did was to name after.him the second city on the island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Both the soils and the climate of the island are specially favorable to vegetation. Palms and tree-ferns grow prodigiously. Oranges, grapefruits and bananas are indigenous. Reforestation is under way, to the extent of a million trees a year. Birds are multitudinous. The rivers are well stocked with fish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">San Juan, the capital, was founded by Ponce de Leon in 1511, and reveals his cleverness. It is on a small island, connected with the mainland by a bridge. On account of its fine harbor, with its narrow and difficult entrance, it is con- ' siderod one of the most impregnable cities in the world, and history has proven it so to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Porto Rico is the land of the motor bus. One hundred eighty-five of these leave San Juan at all hours- of the day and night, for all parts of the island. Named after the sound of their horns these vehicles are known in Porto Rico as GuaGuas. The round-trip fare from San ■ Juan to Ponce, 170 miles, is only $4.20, and the ride is said to be one of the most beautiful and cue of the most crooked in the world. The high- '</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The religion, what there is of it, is Roman Catholic, but is not taken seriously by anybody except those who have it for a business. Slaves from Africa were brought in within fifty years of the discovery of the island, to take the place of the Indians who had been worked to death or driven away. Slavery was ' abolished in March, 1873, having become unprofitable.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>The Porto Rican Melting-Pot</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font8">N PORTO RICO no one thinks anything unusual of it. if a white woman marries a brown or black man, or if a -white man marries a brown or black woman. But as a matter of fact the black race is as surely passing out as the red, and the last red man’s village has been gone from Porto Rico for two hundred years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Porto Rican professional life there is </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">good mixture of whites, negroes and mulattoes </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">among all the different occupations. The mon seem to get along together all right, and to take </span><span class="font8">it as a matter of course, but the women are less tolerant; so the tendency of the whites is to marry whites, and the tendency of the blacks also is to marry whites or mulattoes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In 1910 the enumeration showed 65.5 percent of the population as white, 30 percent mulatto and 4.5 percent black. Ten years later the proportions were 73 percent white, 23.2 percent mulatto and 3.8 percent black. At this rate it will not . be long before the blacks will all be gone. And other reasons are operating, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After four hundred years of Spanish rule the percentage of illiteracy in Porto Rico was, in 1899, over 83 percent. This has been reduced to 55 percent, and there are now 4,238 public elementary schools; yet there are about 300,000 boys and girls between the ages of five and seventeen who do not attend school. There are about twenty high schools, a normal school and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">university.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The agricultural laborers, jibaros, as they are <sub>s</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;naturally bright, generous, be spit a- ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">’loyal, but their poverty and ignorance are almost measureless. Barefoot, almost nude, living in straw huts of two rooms, the jibaro's family of perhaps ten children subsist'? cidietably pa one meal a day of black coffee, polished.&quot;rice and beans, with occasionally a </span><span class="font8">little fried codfish. No fruit, no vegetables, no vitamines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The jibaro’s home has usually a built-in hunk, a shelf and a few boxes. The space beneath the house serves as a shelter for pigs,' goats and chickens. There are no latrines, nor comforts of any kind. The one meal is cooked with charcoal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Desperate Poverty of the Jibaro</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font8">HE usual wage of the jibaro is fifty cents a day, but may run as high as $1.25, or fall to even thirty cents. On these wages he can not afford more than one meal a day, with the consequence that the return which he can render is meager. He is blamed for being shiftless, and so he is; but when the government tried, feeding the laborers with three good meals a day the result was over one hundred percent increase in efficiency. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As a result of poor housing and poor food the jibaro is dying off rapidly with tuberculosis, and hookworm and malaria cut into his effi</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ciency; yet his family grows astoundingly, asis often the case in lands where economic con</span><span class="font8">ditions make people hopeless. And the jibaro on one meal a day, with fifty cents wages and ten mouths to feed, is a hopeless man, from his point of view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One wonders why the jibaro does not eat the fruits which grow so readily. The answer is that they do not belong to him, and he could not afford to eat them if they did. They are too valuable for export purposes. But he does eat many bananas and sweet potatoes. Otherwise he could hardly exist. These he raises on the little patch assigned to him by his employer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Porto Rico is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, having been estimated, as of 1925, to have 407.22 to the square mile. The claim is often made by the shortsighted that there are too many Porto Ricans and that the only solution is for the surplus to emigrate; but they do not seem inclined to do </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">this, and we are sure the Lord will have a better</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sugar</span><span class="font9"> c </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Blessing and a Curse &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">WENTY-FIVE' years ago.'.Porto BieO-i'lhp several hundred small sugar factories, with an output of 69,000 tons of sugar annually. Now it has about fifty modem factories, turning out ten' times that number of tons. 'TftB </span><span class="font8">looks like astounding'progress, does it not, especially when the profits have been known to exceed 100 % in one year? But there are two sides to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Organic Law of Porto Rico, adopted in the year 1900, provides that no corporation shall own or control more than five hundred acres of land; yet the five hundred largest corporations and individual owners in the island have actual holdings of eight, hundred thousand acres. The sugar interests have not kept the spirit of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The need of Porto Rico is for many and small farms: yet in twenty years the number of small farms has fallen off so greatly that those holding less than ten acres have decreased in number from 31,959 to 15,981. The property is all going into the hands of the big fellows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sugar-cane is a bad crop in an island where the population is excessive. It is essentially a Big Business crop, calling for many workers from January to June, few<sup>7</sup> from July to September, and very few from October to December. The profits are all sent out of the island, and with the sugar estates elbowing all other agricultural interests out of the island the sugar employes have a hard time to find food in their idle months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is estimated that from two-thirds to four-fifths of the wealth produced in Porto Rico goes abroad in the shape of dividends to absentee owners of stock in the sugar and tobacco industries. Is the country prosperous? The answer is Yes, if you mean the trusts; but it is No, if you mean the people.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Anxiety of the People</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">HYHE Porto Rican people seem to be anxious that the American people should know about their predicament; but they are a thousand miles off shore, they. speak a different language, have a different religion and different customs, and it is hard to awaken a people to-the cries of their fellow men as long as their dividends are coming in regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Up to the present time the corporations that are interested in Porto Rico have succeeded in preventing any investigation of the conditions which hold the very poor down to one meal a day and prevent his getting a start, by fixing </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the interest and commissions on loans as high as 48%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">It is claimed that the federal income tax law works in such a way that the Big Business eon-</span><span class="font8">the country of three-fourths of its wealth, but' . pay no income nor other taxes, and that the reason no investigation is made is because the rich Porto Ricans, who control 35% of the capital invested in the sugar and other businesses, have an all-powerful voice with the legislature and the courts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are on the island 619 industrial establishments, of which 55 are in the sugar and molasses business and 169 are tobacco establishments. Considerable-drawn work is manufactured, but the work is done under such close contracts with the New York employers that none of the lace can be bought in Porto Rico at all.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Politics and More Politics</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">P</span><span class="font8">ORTO RICO has too much politics for its own good. The governor, the auditor and the commissioner of education are appointed by the president of the United States. The senate is composed of nineteen members and the house of representatives of thirty-nine members. The island is represented in the United States congress by a resident commissioner elected every four years. Its citizens are automatically citizens of the United States, except . 277 who have definitely elected to be citizens of no country at all. The legislature meets every other year for a session of ninety days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are three political parties : the Unionist, which professes to desire complete independence of the United States; the Republican, which professes a desire that Porto Rico become one of the states of the United States and be governed like the rest of the states; and the Socialist party. The issues between these parties are believed to be, for the most part, insincere and trivial, as in the United States, and are actually used to obtain office, as is true here also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The cry of the Unionist party for independence is believed to be entirely hypocritical, and put up solely with the object of making the people of the island think that independence would bring better conditions. Actually the Unionists do not wish independence and 'would be alarmed if it were thrust upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The reason for this is that the Unionists are the party of money, power and privilege. Their financial support comes from the sugar and oth-great interests, and. their Job</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">their interests. is to their interest</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">their sugar into the United States .free of duty. Otherwise they would have to compete on even terms with Cuba, and this they have not the least wish to do. Independence is. everything they do not want. But they do want the votes of the people, and meanwhile no investigations, please. How simple it all is. The poor people are always stung in the same way by their loudmouthed deliverers and benefactors.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Restraint of Liberties &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font8">T IS small wonder that a people whose desperate poverty limits them to one meal a 'day, and who at the same time are full-fledged citizens, each with just as much right to vote as if he were a millionaire, should wish to do something to change such intolerable conditions. Moreover, it is inevitable that somebody will rise up sooner or later to call attention to the conditions and suggest that they be changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is the case with regard to Porto Rico. The American Federation of Labor of the United States knows of the conditions there and is agitating for a better state of affairs. Their spokesman and representative is Senor Santiago Iglesias, a Cuban by birth, president of the Free Federation of Workers of Porto Rico, and also, incidentally, head of the Socialist party. It is hard to see how Socialism could help spreading in Porto Rico under such circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Like most Porto Ricans, Senor Iglesias is the father of a large family; and this endears him to the people. Five of the daughters of his family of eleven children are named with the Spanish equivalents of the words liberty, equality, fraternity, America and justice. He is considered an exceedingly well-informed'; intelligent and sagacious man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When he first undertook the cause of the Federation of Labor in Porto Rico the authorities clapped him into jail; but clapping people into jail for thinking or using their vocal organs seems not to be as popular or successful as it once was, and the Federation of Labor cabled - - $5/)00 to secure his release on bail. Since then the Socialist party has grown by leaps and bounds, showing that his imprisonment was a very indiscreet thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">• Senor Iglesias charged that at the elections </span><span class="font8">in 1924 government officials afforded no protec</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">tion of the workers, who were clubbed by the police, driven from the polling places, and in </span><span class="font8">some instances were held on the plantations so that they could not vote. He claimed that thousands of other. hungry, bare-footed peasants walked two or three hours from the country so that they might vote, but were held in line until the polls were closed. He claimed also that votes were not counted when cast; that observers for the workers’ candidates were not permitted to function; and that in many in-, stances when they first presented themselves at the polls they were told: “You have already voted.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The charge was also made that, contrary to law, the ballots were opened by election officers before being put into the ballot box, so that bribes could be intelligently paid. Also, that at the time of recounting enough ballots were declared null by election officers to change the results. In one town of 2,237 voters, 400 labor votes were thus declared null.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Christmas time in the year .1924, the Porto Rican Elections Protest Committee sent the following message to the American congress at Washington: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year from the people of Porto Hico. The Porto Rican elections, held November 4,1924, are the greatest outrage upon American citizenship ever committed.: Fraud, violence, corruption, wholesale robbery! When the time comes and all the facts are laid before you, please help to right this wrong.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>The President’s Attitude</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">O</span><span class="font8">FFSETTING these charges, the government claimed that there was no intimidation of voters, and that the large percentage of illiteracy made it inevitable that many ballots should be rejected. In his refusal to authorize an investigation of Porto Rican affairs. President Coolidge made the following statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We found that a people of Porto Rico poor and distrest, without hope for the future, ignorant, poverty-stricken, and diseased, not knowing what constituted a free and democratic government. We have progressed in the relief of poverty and distress, in the eradication of disease, and have attempted, with some success, to inculcate in the inhabitants the basic ideas of a free, democratic government. Perhaps no territory in the world has received such considerate treatment in the past thirty years as has Porto Rico, and perhaps nowhere else has progress been so marked and so apparent as in Porto Rico. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;....... <sup>:</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.......</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">There is, no doubt, a great deal of truth in what President Coolidge has said, and there is </span><span class="font8">no possible question that the large and rapidly growing population of the island creates problems which are not easy of solution; but if it be true that three-fourths of what is produced in the island goes to absentee owners and stockholders, and if it be true that the people in general are held down to one meal a day and their landholdings are being rapidly gobbled up by the sugar interests: then it would seem to be high time that an investigation be made, and the American people should face the facts as they exist and do something to remedy conditions.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark32"></a>The Rumanian Government at Bay</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">O</span><span class="font8">F ALL the evil governments in the world the Rumanian government is generally conceded to be the vilest. Times without number the central ruling powers have encouraged local authorities to begin or participate in or condone violence against Jews and other inoffensive persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">- Rumania is under the complete control of Big Business. It has a firm grip on all the treasures of the country, including rich oil fields, coal mines, forests, fisheries, foundries, factories, granaries, water powers, transportation, banks, etc. It is a replica of what Big Business would like the United States to become.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Rumania Big Business is married to the Eastern Orthodox Church; and there is no mistake about the union, either. All citizens are required to contribute to its gigantic building program and to its support. A man who refused to make such contributions had his taxes tripled. That was engineered through the political end of the Big Swindle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A short time ago two representatives of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, Herrn Balzereit and Dollinger, visited Rumania to look after the Society’s interests there. They were promptly arrested without cause, and thrown into prison with fifteen others “of this way”, where they received much unkind treatment before they were released. «</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Lord seems to be taking notice of these things, for since the above incident strange things have happened in Rumania. The Balkans have been shaken with many and serious earthquakes, volcanoes have been stirred into activity and the soot thrown into the upper air has fallen in the form of Black rain, terrorizing the inhabitants. An Associated Press dispatch on the subject says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Populace in Panic as Skies Are Darkened</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CERNAUTI. Rumania, April 26 (AP).— The whole, population was panic-stricken this afternoon when a </span><span class="font6">heavy, slimy rain converted the day into black night. People knelt in the slime-covered streets to pray for mercy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The phenomenon was attributed to lava dust from the Balkan regions, which have been repeatedly shaken by earthquakes during the past week. The dust was believed to have been precipitated by mixing with rain. Similar occurrences have been reported from Bessarabia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To the forces of nature have been added the terrors of two hundred fifty thousand peasants marching to their ancient capital of Alba Julia and demanding a change of government. Orderly and quiet they came, but in overwhelming numbers, and with overwhelming determination that there must be a radical change or there will be trouble of a very real kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The crafty Rumanian government played a despicable trick on the peasant at the close of the World War. To gratify his reasonable longings they gave him land, breaking up the great estates of the accursed Rumanian aristocracy. But when he needed money these same aristocrats charged him 30, 40 or 50% interest and economically he was worse off than when they owned the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They also gave him the ballot; but he has found from experience that his vote is not counted or else is counted opposite to the way it was given. No matter how strongly the peasants come out the Bratianu government always wins, because it polices the polls and the police of Rumania are mere tools to do what they are told by the higher-ups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Conditions in Rumania are so vile, speaking from the standpoint of good government, that when Henry Ford was placing factories 'all over the world, and wished to place </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">a factory </span><span class="font8">in Rumania, and the people wished it placed-there, he did net dare to take the risk, for there is no justice there at all. <sup>:</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">■ % Now ■ th|t ||ihst fit s<sup>:</sup> arit-the|||iigbiii</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">illegally elected, that it is incompetent, tyrannical and not. representative of the will of the people. Not within the present generation has there, been such a demand of the common people for better government as was shown in Rumania on May 6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The peasants came for two hundred miles, using every known form of vehicle from wooden-wheeled ox-carts, gigs and surreys to automobiles. They slept in the open, shivering in the cold rain; and ate fried corn mush, which is all the peasants of Rumania can afford to eat. Every road leading to Alba Julia was crowded with thousands of pilgrims, quiet, orderly, determined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Arrived at their destination the peasants by uplifted hands took the following oath: “We swear to the great and good God to fight a righteous fight against the government, which is a plague to the country, and which was nominated by a decree wrung from King Ferdinand on his death-bed. We swear that a new’ Rumania shall be created which shall stand for freedom and justice to all of Rumania's brave sons.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The assembly made solemn declaration that they are not revolutionists nor Bolsheviki but that they want an honest government. .They modestly begged the outside world not to identify the present corrupt regime with the people of Rumania. They declared that the government by its illegal seizure of power is ruining their country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They solemnly accused the government of being domestic enemies who have tyrannized the country with unconstitutional government for ten years and who have treated the people as if they were subjects of some colonial possession; and they demanded the immediate removal of the prime minister and the inauguration in his place of a man of their choice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They also notified the government that if all peaceful means to dislodge the government fail they will surely adopt active resistance and that as they represent the whole Rumanian people there can be but one outcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At last accounts the government maintained its sullen attitude of unconcern as to what the people want. They had ten thousand troops on hand at Alba Julia, but the troops had nothing to do. One thing ought to be very plain to them, however, and that is that ‘the hand is already writing on the wall’. The end of the old order is in plain sight, and it seems to us to be the judgment of Almighty God against an evil and abominable rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark34"></a>A Study of the Soviet Government</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">^T&gt;USSI.A After Ten Years” is the title of JA a study of the Soviet government made during the summer of 1927 by the American Trade Union Delegation to the Soviet Union. It is a crisp and lucid account, giving a good general view of all sides of the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The twenty-four members of the delegation, a majority of whom were college-educated men, went where they wanted to go and saw’ what they wanted to see in all parts of the country. Everything was open to them. They talked not only with those friendly to the Soviet government but with those bitterly hostile to it. They are of the opinion that Russia is unconquerable by external force of arms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">They found it difficult to judge Russia honestly because the East is so unlike the West, such a mixture of poverty and gaudy splendor. Many of the things they saw have been accurately re? ported in the press from time to tiipe. The report paid special attention to trtife unions, </span><span class="font8">wage scales, conditions of employment and so.--eial insurance. We quote a paragraph:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One must conclude that the Russian system of labor legislation affords the fullest protection, within the standard of living permitted by the productivity of industry, of any country in. the world. The workers are in practice protected against unduly long hours, injuries, bad conditions of employment, and losses resulting from accidents, illness, old age, unemployment, and the death of wage earners, which menace the lives of workers in other lands. In no other country of which we know is there s-uch a systematic protection for moth</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ers and </span><span class="font6">children and for tired and ill workers.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As to the condition of the peasantry the report states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Statistics of food consumption show that the peasant is eating about the same amount of bread, But of better quality. 15 percent more meat. 13 percent, more milk, the same amount of butter, and 28 percent more eggs. Although figures are lacking, we have reason to believe that tho peasant is eating more vegetables and fruit. He is as yet securing less furniture, clothes and. other </span><span class="font6">manufactured goods than were available to him in 1913, but he is enabled to use more of his own products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is no political liberty in Russia. Active opponents of the soviet system of government are not allowed to address public meetings. There is </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">bo</span><span class="font8"> liberty of press, the excuse being made that in capitalist countries there is also no freedom of the press. A poor excuse. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The position regarding pacifists is the same as in America and England. Pacifists must render non-combatant service in time of war or go to prison. Persons accused of being antagonistic to the government can not be represented at, the trial by their own lawyers, nor can they exercise the free right to call witnesses in their own behalf. The court is at once the accuser and the judge, a truly diabolical judicial system. Many thousands of persons tried in these &quot;courts” are in exile in Siberia and Turkestan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Referring to the refusal of the United States government to recognize the Soviet system even ten years after its establishment, the report mentions the loan of $193,000,000 made to the so-called Bakhmetiev government and says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Most of this money was used by Bakhmetiev after the fall in November, 1917, of the Kerensky government, which he represented in the United States. Mr. Bakhmetiev subsequently remained in Washington for several years, being recognized during this time by the State Department as the official representative of the Russian government, although his government was nonexistent. The major portion of these funds was used, with the knowledge of our government, to purchase military supplies for the armies of Admiral Kolchak and other counter-revolutionists, who invaded Russia and attempted to overthrow the Soviet government. It is obviously the height of unfairness for our government to insist upon collecting from the Russian government the cost of the munitions which were used in an attempt to crush it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Vulnerable parts of the Body. The point of the bayonet should be directed against the opponent’s throat, especially in hand-to-hand fighting, so that the point will enter easily and make a fatal wound on penetrating a few inches. Other vulnerable and frequently exposed parts are the face, chest, lower abdomen, thighs, middle, when the back is turned, the kidneys. The arm pit, which may be reached with a jab, if the throat is protected, is vulnerable. because it contains large blood vessels and a nerve center.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Description of the parries? From the position of guard the body is forced forward to the full extent of the reach. . . . The barrel (of the gun) is kept up, the point threatening the opponent’s body, preferably his throat. If the parry right is properly made, it is easy to kill the opponent with the thrust which immediately follows. In fact, the opponent will usually impale himself on the point. . . . Parry left is followed </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">up at once either with a thrust or a butt stroke to the ribs- or jaw.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">French or vertical butt strokes, (a) Butt stroke </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">No. </span><span class="font6">1. Swing up the Inrtt at the opponent’s- crotch, ribs, forearm or any exposed part of the body, using a half arm blow, advancing with the rear foot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(b) Butt stroke No. 2. If the opponent jumps back so that the first butt stroke misses, the rifle will come into a horizontal position over the left shoulder, bntf leading. The attacker will then jump in and dash the butt into the opponent’s face.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(cj Slash. If the opponent retires still farther out of range, the attacker again closes up and slashes his bayonet down on the opponent's head, or the neck if the opponent is wearing a steel helmet. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Open ground or horizontal butt strokes, (a) Butt stroke No. 1. With a half arm blow, swing the butt up at opponent’s jaw, advancing the rear foot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(b) Butt stroke No. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2.</span><span class="font6"> The butt can now be dashed into the opponent's face as described under vertical butt stroke No. 2 above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Fend off opponent’s thrust with the left hand. Step in and kick him in the crotch or on the shin.

It was kept soaked in oil so as to be heavy and also pliable. Food was not cooked in separate pots or served in separate dishes, but beans, potatoes and corn were all stewed together in one pot and poured out in long troughs from which the slaves ate without knives, forks or spoons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If any order was disobeyed or punishment resisted, a hundred strokes more than usual wore added.

<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font8"> COMMUNICATION from subscribers in</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Greece states that they have positive proof that in Kabbala, Neapolis, under the presidency and protection of the bishop of the city, one Chrysostomos, there has been organized a Comitadji., or association of assassins, which has in view and has received a commission to accomplish the assassination of all Bible Students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This would be a perfectly regular thing for a bishop. To some of our readers who are not familiar with the duties of a bishop, this might seem a triflic raw; but the most important thing, to a bishop, is to keep his job, no matter what happens to a Bible Student. And the Bible Students are making the jobs of all bishops unpleasant and unsafe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As to the proposed assassinations themselves, the Lord will have something to say about that when the time comes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font8">. BIBLE Student in North Carolina asked a number of pointed questions of the Reverend R. R. Caldwell, bearing upon man’s destiny at death, the resurrection of the dead, the origin of hell, the soul of man, and the nature of Christ Jesus, the Savior of men. The Reverend seemed to think that the kindly-put questions were in the nature of a reflection on his theology, and in order to make his attitude perfectly clear he opened his replies to the questions with the following interesting statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If I thought there were no eternal torment, I would not suffer want of money or anything of this world ; for if I found one who had money I would knock him in the head and take it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I want to, in a kindly spirit, suggest that you give your Bible a more impartial and general study. That is the great thing you need. Your interpretations of scripture is absolutely in error of the worst type.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With no evil spirit nor ill will I write.</span></p>

Only a lousy god could be happy in seeing lousy humans, and only a lousy religion could think of lousiness as anything but lousy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sidney Dark, writing of one of the most famous “saints” of the dark ages, says of Thomas a Becket:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Becket was deliberately verminous. He wore a hair shirt and permitted his body to be constantly bitten as part of the discipline of his life. When the monks picked up Becket’s body after his death they discovered this for the first time: his hair shirt and close-fitting hair-drawers “were covered with white linen, so that no one should know of his daily agony to which the Archbishop submitted himself.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark147"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark148"></a>“The Short and Simple</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font8"> AM going to give you a little of my own experience to show you what the poor laboring man rearing a family in the present generation has to undergo and contend with. My mind goes back to the nightmare, in this case actual, of my own starving little girl begging her mother piteously for a biscuit which her mother was powerless to supply. This same daugther of mine grew up in suffering and weak from extreme malnutrition because the peculiarities of her appetite caused her to reject even to the point of starvation, certain articles of food, to which the rest of the family through circumstances were restricted, and which circumstances prevented giving this girl the diet she should have had. It was not until she was old enough to obtain a job herself that she was able to better her condition. If the present state child labor laws had been in force then she could not have done this at the age she did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At one time in Alabama I had an experience that can not be forgotten. I was in a badly worked-down condition, when I contracted malarial fever. I was trying to support a wife and three children on wages that were a mere pittance. All were weak from malnutrition. I could not afford to stop work. Imagine, if you can, working in a factory eleven hours a day during a period of burning fever. I had just been transferred to a very light job or it would have been impossible. As it was I collapsed about the time the fever broke up. I went back to work again when so weak that my legs felt like rubber tubes under me, and my work was of a walking character. Was some time getting-over the ill effect of this. Indeed I am not sure I have yet fully recovered. If the kindness of divine providence had not enabled -me to get away and better my condition as it did, and at the time it did, I believe that there is little question that my two oldest children would have been buried, and quite possibly myself also. But how many, oh how many sad cases in which Providence has never come to their relief I</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After the above experience I moved to a state noted for good wages and industrial prosperity. During the years I was there I had far more steady work than the average laborer, and my wages most of this time were above the minimum wage received by common labor on light work; yet during the most of this time I was unable to give my family the diet they should</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark149"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark150"></a>” (Contributed) ■</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">have had, and with rheir inherited weak physical tendencies the most of them were not free from malnutrition. Kitchen waste was reduced to the lowest reasonable minimum. Food was purchased in the most economical form that could reasonably be obtained in the small quantities at the time when usually necessary to buy. There was no extravagance in clothes. In the more than a quarter-century of married life t have bought one eight-dollar suit of Sunday clothes, one ten-dollar suit, two fifteen-dollar suits, and one ten-dollar overcoat. My wife has dressed accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Serving usually as my own family physician I have saved myself and family the burden of the heavy doctor bills most poor people have to meet. My family have been far better provided for than a large element who have been subject to the evils of sickness, doctor bills, funeral expenses and unsteady employment. I have been and still am heart-sick from the cases of suffering from dire want and poverty that have come to my attention. Yet in spite of my better financial condition, during most of the time I lived in this prosperous state I had to put my family on as restricted a diet as I dared to. I watched carefully their state of health, and, when it appeared to be approaching a danger point, in some way made, at least temporarily, such changes or additions to their diet as my pocketbook would admit. I myself have for days in and out suffered from lassitude and lack of energy with an intense longing for certain foods I did not feel able to afford, like the appetite of the drunkard for the liquor he is deprived of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The fact that my children have succeeded in obtaining more or less work after reaching the age of fourteen has lifted from me what would otherwise have been a crushing burden, and has saved the children themselves from much suffering. The cost of a child’s rearing is in ratio to its age. A child at fourteen is on the average an expense of one-half more than the living expense of either of its parents. At sixteen and on it is double that of its parent. A child put to work suited to its strength at fourteen will usually adjust itself to labor. At sixteen and over one has more or less difficulty in doing so, as one has formed habits and desires adverse to manual labor. This is not theory. On the contrary, it has been demonstrated in thousands of</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">cases. There are exceptions, hut I am not talking of these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is not the children employed, that is causing men to walk the streets. Women are crowding out men in most lines of work of a nature suited to woman’s strength. Improved machinery is making more and more work of that kind. I worked in a factory which, in the last years I worked there, ran a bus to a town eighteen miles away (if I remember the distance right) for girls, and another bus to a town ten miles distant. This city where this factory was situated was not a workingman’s paradise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For several years I lived in a state that had been prominent for its school laws and educational advantages. During this time I worked with a young generation who had but little experience in .manual labor until out of school. A few were fairly able to adjust, themselves to labor conditions, but others were more or less unable to do so. No civilization can long stand under the influence of a generation reared in this way. It is nothing short of a curse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As the youths themselves can not be benefited, but rather cursed, by the agitated child labor laws, some one must have an advantage. If not certain phases of labor, then who is.it? Let some one answer. If this agitation does not result from a selfish influence, then where under the sun is it coming from? Some one will say that if immature youth were banished from all fields of labor there would be more employment for needy adults. Admitting for argument's sake that this might be true, where is the good of it if the youths themselves are ruined for a little material benefit to the adult? Then again, how many youths arc working who are not themselves needy? It is not the nature for the average boy or girl to work when otherwise not compelled by parent or guardian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The fact is, selfishness has the poor world by the throat; and the world is going to be completely strangled before it lets go its hold. Every effort of man to better his condition is influenced by selfishness, and the result is that he makes a bad mess of about everything lie undertakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">King Tut’s Last Cent</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font8"> WRITER in the Boston </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Transcript</span><span class="font8"> points out that if King Tut had been able to leave just one cent to his posterity, with interest compounding on it at four percent, his descendants at this time would have considerable change, ‘&quot;because one cent at 4 percent in 100 years gives a compound interest of 491 cents, or an amount of 50.505 cents. Then in thirty-five centuries it becomes the thirtv-fifth power of that amount, or $413,740,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,009,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.” The writer is A. J. Dow, a professor of mathematics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To help us understand what that means, the professor explains that, figuring gold as worth $300,000 a cubic foot, the value of King Tut’s last cent would have to be expressed in globes or spheres, and there would be a good many of them, and of incredible size. The professor puts it this way:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I saw descending this great sphere of gold from the heavens, a sphere of solid gold nearly two hundred million miles in thickness, and after it another, and another, one for every second of time from the date of the death of</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Tut-ankh-amen to the date of the visit of Queen Marie to the UNITED STATES—over 110 billion seconds, and over 110 billion spheres! And the value can be called 163,850 times a trillion trillion times a trillion trillions of dollars. - Yon may write it as: 16385 followed by forty-nine zeros. And was one cent at compound interest during the same 3500 years or the same 110 billion seconds, worth as much and more than those 110 billion golden spheres? Yes! Twenty-five thousand times more!” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Armageddon will accomplish the complete destruction of the interest system, which otherwise would enslave the human family to perpetuity. It can be proven that at </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">1%</span><span class="font8"> the interest system, unchecked, would destroy any civilization man could possibly create.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Suppose a man were left a million dollars to compound annually at 1%. In about two hundred years it would double thrice and the million would then be eight millions. In four hundred years it would be 64 millions. In six hundred years it would be 512 millions. In eight hundred years it would be $4,096,000,000. In a thousand years it would be $32,768,000,000. In twelve hundred years it would be $262,144,000,000 and in fourteen hundred years it would be $2,097,152,000,000 and its possessor could buy the entire land surface of the earth at sixty dollars an. acre and have millions left. In 2,000 years his fortune would be $1,057,901,824,000,000 and he could, erect a $30,000 house on each acre and still have plenty to live on, .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Value of Life </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. T. G. Llnebarger</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&gt;&lt;OST of us make great preparations for old age and death; few of us prepare for long life. Death is an unnatural condition and life is a natural one; so why not prepare to live longer? Why not pay more attention to living and less attention to dying? More attention to health and less attention to disease? More attention to uplifting things and less attention to degrading ones ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The average person carries-life insurance in order that his estate may be wealthier by a few thousand dollars at his death; but suppose he could take that, few thousand dollars and buy with it one years additional health and life, do you think that he would do it? There is not a reader who would not pay five or ten thousand dollars for one year of health, and life. Of course we do not care to gamble to that extent, but we would do that if we were positive now that a year’s additional health and life could be bought for that much money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the one hand we see human beings every day who by neglect shorten their lives more than one year in a period of only a few years ; on the other hand some of us live to be fifty or seventy-five years of age in spite of our present civilization. Note some of the products of this civilization: Highly refined starches, sugars and other foods; foods that have had life-giving elements destroyed or removed; foods that contain little or no value; the automobiles that take from, us, to a great extent, the necessity of walking; the street cars, hard pavements, hard floors, all of which tend to cause improper structural conditions and also cause us to become exceedingly lazy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A ’part of our civilization is the speed that we employ. In fact, unnatural and abnormal methods of living shorten'our lives; but some one will say, “We live more in ten years than our forefathers lived in a lifetime.” Possibly this is a fast, but why die more in ten years than our forefathers died in twenty years? Why live on our nerves all the time ? Why can not we make living a sensible business? Let us expel superstition, hate, greed, envy, and all of those improper mental conditions. Let us become loyal, forgiving, patient and helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We are here to live, not to die. Disease and death are curses, not blessings. Naturally, under present conditions death is sometimes a blessing; but if disease could be destroyed, death would then become the greatest curse. No one wants to live, say with a broken back, for an indefinite period of time. In the ease of such an affliction death is a blessing. However, if disease did not exist, life would indeed be sweet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A great deal of the disease to which we have fallen heir is brought on by some or all of the unnatural conditions mentioned. Improper food is the cause of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font8"> very great deal of our suffering. Mental conditions also cause us suffering, both mental and physical. A physical abnormality, no doubt, causes more suffering than any other one thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As a general rule, while other organs of the body are comparatively<sup>7</sup> healthy, some one organ becomes seriously diseased and causes the death, of the patient. Life is generated in the brain by the aid of other organs and in turn distributed from the brain to each and every organ of the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Health depends upon the proper distribution of this life. All. of us have had these things forcibly brought to our attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Would it not be a wonderful, thing to know that our lives could be extended ten, fifteen or twenty years? In most cases it seems not only possible but probable that such an extension ofi life may 'be accomplished. However, in order to accomplish this, some serious thought must be given to our process of living. Our food must be better; our mentality must be better; and our physical condition must be made proper by </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">causing proper relationship between organs to</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Why is it that all of us expect to die and, prepare to at the age of fifty or seventy-five years, when it has been shown that cells placed in a proper environment may live indefinitely and that cells in an improper medium, which have become aged, placed in a proper medium take on the appearance and activity of youthful ones!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Does it not seem reasonable that if the medium of our bodies could be corrected by better eating, better thinking, better living, by correction of the relationship between tissues, life in these individual cells could he maintained for a longer period of time, and the process of old age retarded ? Does it seem reasonable that we should die from old age or disease at seventy-five, when it has been shown so definitely that cells, need, not die?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dr. Carroll, of the Rockefeller Institute, and other men of like character, have proven this fact. Then why do we go ahead committing suicide daily,?, ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">- It is stated that in the United States about 300,000 babies, die during their first year. Some of this loss., is unavoidable; but I assure you that a great deal of. it is caused by improper feeding of either the infant or the mother, thereby causing, the infant’s inability to properly generate and distribute life to its various organs; and, because of its exceeding tenderness, it is doomed to die. Think of this enormous, unnecessary loss!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We have time and money to spend on our automobiles, on our fishing paraphernalia, on our golf sticks, but very little time to encourage the proper growth and life of our babies and children. If Tommy lias a cough, he will soon recover from it and we pay little attention unless it is exceedingly serious, according to our conception of it. But, let one knock occur in our wonderful, new automobile, and we are worried sick because of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">..............of......ffle.......fitftf.......Ilfflilffibss and disregard for our poor helpless charges! Can you understand why we have grown to be such selfish monsters that we, through avoidable ignorance in some cases, actually murder our children? No, I don’t mean murder them in such a manner that we are accountable to the State because of it; but I mean by improper feeding, by improper care, by neglect generally, by thinking that it is necessary for our children to contract all sorts of so-called eliiM’s diseases, by wilfillness and ignorance generally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Do you think that it is not- time for ns to become educated, thinking ..individuals?' Do you not think that our children deserve as miich attention as our automobiles ? Do you' think proper food and proper.care, I mean necessary physical attention and adjustings of our children, are such a hardship on us, when we are the cause of their presence here?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Do you think'■that,if■■,we can afford to,pay $1.50 a gallon for oil for our automobiles we can not afford to buy proper food for our babies? If you. think that, then I would advise you now to, sell your automobile tomorrow. Your life, your wife’s life, your, children’s lives, have a far greater value than any other possession that you own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Is it impossible to cause you to see the great value that life has? Will you guard this treasure that has been entrusted to your care-more closely than you have ever done before? Will you promise now to be honest with yourself? Won’t you care for your body before your health, is ruined?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Won’t you allow youi’ children to grow into manhood and womanhood ■ in such a manner that they may be capable of bringing honor to you? Won’t it give you a thrill to have your children, when grown to manhood or womanhood, point to you with, pride and say, “That is my father,” or “'That is my mother’’?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Life is our most valuable possession. Money, diamonds, lands, buildings, railroads, steamships, if you had all of these that the world contains, they would not be worth the life of yourself, your son, your daughter, your wife, or your friend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">May I appeal to you again to take care of your body, to take care of those bodies that are in your keeping, to give every individual the chance to Jive that he or she has inherited, to fight death as an ■ enemy, to fight disease as a worse enemy, to pay attention to your condition before you are incapacitated and an incurable wreck?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">May I ask you to respect yourself and others with whom you come in contact. From today forward, let us prepare to live; let us look forward to life and happiness instead of gloom and death; let us take proper care of our bodies. It pays.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark151"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark152"></a>Big Business Smiles on Big Church</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">B</span><span class="font8">IG Church has found that it does not pay to do business on a small scale. No more small churches, small buildings, small collections or anything else small will do in this day of big things, so the churches are going in for Business Temples. That is what they call them, and that is what they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Among the cities that are provided with such temples are Boston, Syracuse, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City and Los Angeles; and now New York is having one, the Broadway Temple. During six days of the week the building is a high-class store and office building. But on Sunday it is what is usually called </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“a </span><span class="font8">church”. The rentals more than provide the running expenses of the enterprise. Big Business puts up the money to build the structures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Big Business approves of the new’ style of church. The crowd that are making such fabulous fortunes today from power, light, gas and water companies find such investments profitable. It soothes their conscience for making electric current at less than one cent a kilowatt and selling it to the dear public at ten cents a kilowatt. And collections are unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It soothes their conscience for bribing legislatures, judges, councilmen, newspapers, and everybody and every thing that could defend the rights of the people, the plain people. It is as near to bribing God as the apostles of Big Business know how’ to make it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The joke of it is that while the clergy snap at the bait and swell up ’with wisdom and piety and imagine -what wonderful things they will all do when they all get together—all the Big Preachers, all the representatives of Big Business and all the Big Politicians—the true and only Jehovah God in the heaven of heavens is laughing at them, holding them in scorn and derision. The Bible says so. Bead the Second Psalm and see for yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When one of these &quot;temples” ’was blessed recently with a $500,000 donation from the president of an electric light and power company the dominie burst into ecstasy with the following statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are coming to the day when notable church structures are vying with the city’s other notable buildings. This is only possible when small ones are eradicated by combinations. And that will be increasingly possible as the various denominations are combined into one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Methodist General Conference in session at Kansas City voted last week—852 to 3—to appoint a commission to make overtures to other Methodist bodies and to the Presbyterian and Congregational churches for union. And it is not. beyond the possible, for these very denominations are already successfully united in Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is no excuse for so many denominations. In all lines of business sane combinations are increasing efficiency and it can be done in the church. And the large city church, similar to Broadway Temple, is always crowded wherever erected, as is demonstrated by such institutions in Boston, Syracuse, Chicago, Kansas City and Los Angeles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The only missing note in this is the absence of the Big Politician. His blessing is also needed, because, theoretically, he has' the power to make Big Church honored, respected, authorized, approved, endorsed and legal. None of them know that all together they constitute the backbone of the Devil’s organization, and will all go down together, dishonored, despised, in garments of shame and confusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Today they are happy together, betraying the poor, loading him with their accursed &quot;'service charges”, charging him five times what they should for everything they control; tomorrow they will learn what the Lord meant in James 5:3: &quot;Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.”</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark155"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark156"></a>The Bible and its Purposes</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">[Radiocast from Station WBBR, New York, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font8">HE past three months I have been spending in California and therefore have not had the opportunity to speak to the radio audience regularly listening to this station. It is now my pleasure to again speak to you concerning the teachings of the Bible, which is of the greatest interest, convenience and necessity for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Big Business owns and operates a chain of the most powerful radio stations on earth. Those stations regularly broadcast a religious feature. The claim is made that in the religions feature Bible instruction is given to the people. That claim is not supported by the facts. The official spokesman of those religious programs is Doctor S. Parkes Cadman. Recently the'following question and answer were broadcast by Doctor Cadman. That question and answer by Doctor Cadman I read :</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> “What is your personal opinion of Judge Rutherford and his publications, viz. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance, Harp of God</span><span class="font8"> and other books that he publishes on Bible questions ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Answer: “I have not made a very careful study of his utterances, but what study I have made convinces me that he is not in the apostolic succession. If any man claims to have the sole interpretation of the Bible, which, affects the whole human race, you may be sure lie is mistaken.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I have been asked to make comment upon Doctor Cadman’s words. My sole purpose in doing so is that the people might have further enlightenment upon a question of importance to them. A frank and fair discussion of any question of importance may result beneficially to those who hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As to apostolic succession, I make no such claim. Probably Doctor Cadman claims for* himself that he is in the apostolic, succession. I hold that he is not. There is no man on earth that is a successor to the apostles. The twelve apostles of Jesus Christ were clothed with plenary power. They have never had any successors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As to the interpretation of the Bible, I do not claim, as Doctor Cadman says, the sole interpretation thereof. The Apostle Peter, who spoke with divine authority, said: “Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.”—2 Peter 1: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The clergymen of the world, including’ Doctor Cadman, are not empowered to interpret the Bible. They have no more authority to interpret the Bible than I or other laymen have. As a lawyer I write a brief and cite the authorities from the standard law books. As a student of the Bible I make a statement of fact, produce an argument, and cite in support thereof the sole authority, which is the Bible. The people who hear can determine for themselves whether or not my position is supported by the Bible. My only desire is to place my argument beside that of the clergymen and then let the people determine whether or not the Bible supports the clergymen or supports what I say. All honest people should desire the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the first place, the clergymen do not believe the Bible. They deny its inspiration and rely upon their own wisdom or the wisdom of some of their predecessors. For this reason they do not broadcast Bible instruction. They broadcast the wisdom of this world, which the Apostle Paul declares is “foolishness in God’s sight”. It is important to know the origin of the Bible and its purposes. This morning I shall devote myself to a consideration of that subject. Beginning next Sunday morning I shall give a series of lectures concerning the reconciliation of man to God. In those lectures I will state well known facts and cite the Bible as my only authority and let my audience determine whether or not the statements made are true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Doctor Cadman will not follow that rule. It is the custom of clergymen to make statements dogmatically and expect the people to take those statements as true, without regard to any supporting authority. As an illustration, recently the question was propounded to Doctor Cadman and broadcast, namely, “Does the Bible teach immortality?” His answer was: “Most emphatically. Yes.” He failed absolutely, however, to cite a single Scriptural authority in support of his statement. In the Bible he will find no support for his dogmatic statement. Now let us consider the Bible and its 'purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Bible is the expressed will of God. It is a light unto the feet of man to guide him in the right way. (Psalm 119:105) It is light, from Jehovah. “'Light is sown .for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.” (Psalm 97;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">11) The man who walks in the light of God’s .Word and delights in His law is a blessed one of the Lord.—-Psalm 1: 1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The first five books of the Bible were written by Moses. These are known as the Pentateuch. How would Moses know what to write ? And how may we know that he wrote the truth? To answer these questions it is necessary to review some of the facts that are known to man. Man is endowed with reasoning faculties, and such he is expected to use. The Bible is so arranged, and was produced under such conditions, that when understood it fully establishes man’s confidence therein as the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Noah was a man devoted to God. He was -brought over from the world that was destroyed by the flood, and in obedience to God’s command he began to replenish the earth. (Genesis 9:1) Noah was the most important man on the earth of his time. He brought with him to this side the flood a knowledge of things that no other man on earth possessed. From the creation of Adam to the end of the great deluge was a period of only 1656 years. In the period from. Adam to the flood men lived for nearly a thousand years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Enoch was a good man, wholly devoted to 'Jehovah, and would naturally gather all the information possible concerning the purposes of God in relation to man. Adam lived more than 300 years after the birth of Enoch. Adam died at the age of 930 years. Enoch was the seventh generation from Adam, and he lived 365 years. During his lifetime he would obtain all knowledge possible concerning the ’history of man and transmit those facts to his son Methuselah, because it is the natural course for a father to transmit important knowledge to his offspring. Methuselah lived to the ripe old age of 969 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Noah was only the third generation from Enoch. Only a few years after Enoch was miraculously taken away Noah was born. Noah must have had personal contact with Methuselah, his grandfather; and from him, and his father Lamech, he would receive all possible .information concerning man that God had given to his forefathers. Noah was 600 years old when the flood came; and in that period of time he would have gathered all the information obtainable from other men who lived contemporaneously and prior to him, and would of course transmit the same to his children and grandchildren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Noah and his son Shem came out of the ark together. Noah lived 350 years after the flood, and Shem lived 502 years after the flood. Two years after Noah’s death Abraham was born. For 150 years thereafter Shem and Abraham were on the earth together, in the same part of the earth, and must have known each other. Undoubtedly Abraham would learn from Shem the details concerning the flood and the relationship of the human family to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Abraham is known as “the father of the faithful”. Knowledge is essential to faith. Abraham could not have had faith without knowledge; therefore he must have received knowledge of God, of His creation of man, and of man’s relation to Him; and this knowledge he would receive from his forefathers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Isaac was the beloved son of Abraham, and most naturally Abraham would fully instruct his beloved son in all things in which Abraham was learned. Isaac was devoted to God, and God greatly blessed him. (Gen. 26: 4) Being descendants of Shem, brought up and residing in the same part of the earth, naturally these men would transmit knowledge from one generation to another. The favored son of Isaac was Jacob. (Genesis 28: 5-14) Jacob had twelve sons, and he bestowed his greatest affection upon his son Joseph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Joseph was sold into Egypt, and after being there for some time became the most important man in Egypt. Then Jacob and his other sons went to spend the remainder of their days in the land of Egypt. Joseph rendered great service to the people of Egypt, and honored the name of Jehovah God. Joseph would receive instruction directly from his father Jacob, and did receive, special instruction from him. (Genesis 49:1-28) This information transmitted to Joseph, and from him to his offspring, would not he easily forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Less than fifty years after the death of Joseph, Moses was born. His life having been miraculously preserved at the time of his birth, and he having been reared in the royal family of the nation, Moses became a man of importance and of learning; and it i s written of him that he was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians. (Acts 7:20-22) When he reached manhood’s estate he took his stand on the side of Jehovah God and God’s chosen people. He preferred to suffer for the sake of righteousness rather than to enjoy the pleasures and riches that Egypt and her royalty, could provide for him. (Hebrews 11:24-27) Egypt was the Devil’s great world empire. It held all the allurements to Moses, but these Moses spurned with contempt; and having faith in God he became a faithful witness to the name of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is only reasonable to conclude that Moses ■was thoroughly familiar with the traditions of his fathers. There must have been handed down to him from generation to generation the history of man. He would knoxv about what had transpired amongst men from Adam to his time. It is not unusual for an American hoy of the present time to learn from his parents important facts of American history. Nor is it unusual for an English boy to learn from his parents the history of the British Empire. With stronger reasoning would a man of Moses’ type learn from his ancestors the facts relating to the human race up to his time. He was therefore eminently qualified to write the history of man, which by the grace of God he would do faithfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The physical facts well known at this day bear eloquent testimony to the truth that long centuries ago the great blaster Workman Jehovah laid deep the coal beds and oil fields, and made the mountains and the valleys, the rivers and the oceans, and brought into existence plant and animal life, and made the earth a habitable place. Even the most ignorant can see that man is fearfully and wonderfully made, and that he is the most intelligent of all the creatures of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Man has a natural trait, or tendency, of keeping a record of events for his benefit and that of succeeding generations. This is proof that God intended it thus to be. God planted this faculty in man. Since the evidence shows that man is the highest form of God’s earthly creation, and since man has a tendency to keep a record of events, it is only reasonable that Jehovah would provide a means for man to keep a record of the most important things concerning himself. If Jehovah had to do with the keeping of such a record, then be it known that that record is correct and contains the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Bible is a history of God’s creation of things earthly, and gives such information concerning His heavenly creation as the same relates to man and his home. It is God’s revelation of Himself to His intelligent earthly creatures. It is His expressed will, and therefore is the statement of His law for the government of His intelligent earthly creatures. Most of the Bible is a record of things which have transpired and which foreshadow greater things to transpire. That part of the Bible we call prophecy is the foretelling and recording of events that must transpire, .before they come to pass. Prophecy is therefore the history of man written in advance. For this reason prophecy can not be understood by man until it is in the course of fulfilment or has been fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Bible discloses Jehovah as the great Eternal One, the Maker of heaven and earth, the very embodiment of wisdom, justice, love and power, and the Giver of every good and perfect gift. He is the complete expression of unselfishness. Therefore it is written of Him in the Word: ‘’God is love.&quot; The Bible tells why man was created, why he turned to wickedness and was sentenced to death, and makes known God’s gracious provision for the redemption, recovery and restoration of mankind to life and to his perfect home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Bible contains a statement of philosophic rules. It completely and fully contrasts good and evil. It shows why evil results in death and why good leads to life everlasting in happiness. It is God’s law concerning man, and therefore contains the perfect and complete code of rules of action by which man can be governed and walk in the way of righteousness. This code of rules also names the penalty for the violation of the law of righteousness. The Bible was written for the benefit of man and to the glory of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In view of the foregoing facts, and in response to the question heretofore propounded, there are two good and sufficient reasons why Moses knew what to write, and why ho wrote the truth: ■»</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">(1) The experiences of men, -as they transpired, were handed down from generation to generation, and Moses made record thereof. There would be no reason, for this record to be anything but the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">(2) Moses was devoted to God. He was chosen by Jehovah to make the record, and in preparing it God’s unerring wisdom guided Moses. In truth and in fact Moses acted merely as an amanuensis of Jehovah. He was the very kind of man whom we should expect God to select for such a work. Ife spurned the Devil and his organization with all of its allurements, and amidst adversity espoused the cause of righteousness.. Not only was he alert in mind and learned in all the ways of men. but his chief qualification was his complete devotion to Jehovah. Many of the great truths stated by him show that they could not have emanated from the mind of a man, but that they were the result of the invisible power of Jehovah operating upon the mind of man.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">IVliat is said concerning Moses can be said of all the writers of the Bible. God chose those-men for the work because of their faith in and faithfulness to Him. As His’unlimited power operated to create the things of the earth, so that power operated to direct and influence the mind of Moses and of other holy men to make record of God’s will concerning man. David was one of these faithful men devoted to the Lord, and concerning that part of the Bible which he wrote he said: “The spirit of the Lord spake by me, and his word was in my tongue,” —2 Samuel 23:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These faithful men of old are called prophets, and they wrote prophecy. The Apostle Peter, who was chosen by Jesus as one of His disciples, under inspiration wrote: “For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the holy spirit.”—2 Peter 1: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is exceedingly interesting to observe how God arranged for important facts to be transmitted from generation to generation, from Adam to Moses, then to have Moses to write, and thereafter other men to write, that His expressed will might be put into proper form for the benefit of man.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark157"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark158"></a>Manuscripts</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">That part of the Bible which, we call the Old Testament was written in the Hebrew language. That which we term the New Testament was originally written in the Greek language. Copies of the original writings of both were afterwards made, and these were called manuscripts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The chosen people of God were made the custodian of the sacred writings of Moses and the other prophets. The people of Israel used the greatest possible care in safeguarding these writings and in informing their people concerning the contents thereof. Of the twelve tribes of Israel the tribe of Levi was set aside to attend to things pertaining to the education of the people in matters relating to God and His Word. From this tribe the priests of God were chosen. These priests were representatives of Jehovah, and were to minister unto the Lord in the name of the Lord for the benefit of the people. The priest was selected to minister unto God in the priest’s office.—Exodus 28:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God laid the obligation upon the priests to read before the people His law which He had caused Moses to write. They were required to inform the people concerning God’s Word spoken through the prophets. In the instruction given to the first high priest the Lord God said: “And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean; and that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the Lord hatlf spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.” (Leviticus 10:10, 11) “For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.”—Malachi 2: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The people were instructed to seek knowledge at the hands of these priests. “And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days, and inquire; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment.” (Deuteronomy 17: 9) One of the purposes of Jehovah is here manifest, to wit, to keep the people informed concerning His Word, to the end that at all times there might be some people on the earth who would have faith in the Bible as His true and sacred Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Centuries after the giving of the law the Apostle Paul, a Jew and an inspired witness of God, wrote that “the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith”, and that ‘'the lav.’ was a shadow of.good things to come’. (Galatians 3:24; Hebrews 10:1) The purpose of a schoolmaster or pedagogue is to instruct and impart knowledge. Here then is the expressed purpose of the law of God, to impart to the people a knowledge concerning Himself and His relationship to man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This confirms the thought that God arranged for the handing down from generation to generation of the truths that He desired men to know, and that this transpired from Adam to Moses in particular. From the time of Moses and thereafter God has caused His Word to be written down by true and faithful men, whom He directed; and this Word constitutes our Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All the original writings have been lost' and 'do not exist. This, however, does hot at all interfere with the authenticity of the Bible. The original manuscripts were kept in the temple or house of the Lord, and at stated times they were brought forth and read to the people. (2 Chronicles 34:14-16) When the Israelites returned from Babylonian captivity, and rebuilt the walls of Jerusalem about the year 454 B. C., the Word given by Jehovah to Moses was brought forth and read to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law<sup>r</sup> of Moses, which the Lord had commanded to Israel. And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation, both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month. And he read therein before the street that was before the Watergate, from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those that could understand ; and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law. And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Sliema, and Anaiah, and ITrijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mish-ael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashba-dana, Zechariah, and Meshullam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all. the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up. And Ezra blessed the Lord, the Great God: and all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped the Lord with their faces to the ground. So they read in the book, in the law of God, distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading. And Nehemiah, which is &lt;the Tirshat-ha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto the Lord your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when, they heard the words of the law.”—Nehemiah 8:16, 8, 9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The indisputable and historical evidence aside from the Bible is to the effect that from the time of Ezra forward there was a rewriting or copying of the original manuscripts, and that such rewriting or copying by faithful and devout men continued until about the year 900 A. D. Many of the manuscripts were destroyed by fanatical Christians (so called) during the persecution of the Jews in the middle ages, particularly in the time of the Crusaders. Others were destroyed by Jews themselves, evidently for the purpose of preventing them from falling into the hands of their enemies. The evidence therefore shows an unbroken chain of transpiring truth, from Eden down to this period of 900 A. D., and that this was done under the direction of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are now in existence three ancient manuscripts. These are copies of the original tongue or language. These manuscripts are, to wit, The Alexandrine, the Sinaitic and the Vatican. These manuscripts show the Bible as it existed shortly after the time of the apostles of Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Alexandrine Manuscript was presented by Cyril Lucar, Patriarch of Constantinople, to Charles the First, king of Britain, in the year 1628, and is preserved in the British Museum to this day. It bears on one page the inscription that it was written by the hand of Thekla the Martyr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Sinaitic Manuscript was discovered by Tischendorf, the German scholar, in a convent situated at the foot of Mount Sinai. This manuscript is kept in the library at Leningrad, formerly St. Petersburg, Bussia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Vatican. Manuscript is the most ancient manuscript in existence. It is kept in the Vatican Library at Rome. These manuscripts have in recent years been accessible to scholars. None of these ancient manuscripts is entirely complete, but is nearly so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Versions</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font8">HE Scriptural text, copied in the same language in which it was originally written, is called a manuscript. A translation of the original language into another language is called a version. The ancient versions of the Scriptures consist of the translations of the Scriptural text from the original language into another language, in the early period of the Christian era. Many of these translations were written by men not more than one generation removed from the time of the apostles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Among these versions is the Syriac, representing very nearly the language employed by the people with whom the Lord Jesus communicated and amongst whom He moved. The Syriac is a very reliable version. Near the close of the fourth century Eusebius Hieronymus Sophronius, otherwise known as St. Jerome, who for many years lived at Bethlehem, revised the old Latin version of the Bible. This version is called the Vulgate. It is a translation into the Latin, and compared with the Greek and Hebrew manuscripts. This is one of the most valuable versions of the Bible. It is often referred to in. other versions or translations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Bible was first given to the people in the English language by the efforts of John Wycliffe, about the year 1367. This version was copied literally from the Latin. Although translated that early, it was not printed for nearly 400 years thereafter. Both Jerome and Wycliffe suffered much persecution because of their faithfulness in translating the Scriptures. Their persecution came chiefly from the clergy. Satan has always opposed those who have been witnesses to the name of Jehovah God. So violently did Satan stir up opposition to the Wycliffe version of the Bible that many of these leaders were burned to death with copies around their necks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The next version of the Bible of importance was that brought forth by William Tyndale, something more than 100 years after Wycliffe’s day. Tyndale published many editions of the New Testament. He translated the major portion of the Old Testament. In the making of his version Tyndale used such original Greek and Hebrew manuscripts as were then available to him. Tyndale’s version of the Bible is really the Bible that all the English-speaking people of earth use now. It has been revised several times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Satan the enemy used the clergy of England to persecute Tyndale because of his faithfulness in translating the Bible. This is one of the proofs that Tyndale was a faithful servant of the Lord. After translating a portion of the Scriptures he was forced into exile in Germany, where he finished the translation and there published many copies of the New Testament. He was determined to get this translation into the hands of the English people. He smuggled it into England by sending his printed copies in barrels, in bales of cloth, in sacks of flour, and in many other secret ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The bishops of the Church of England and others of the clergy used every means within their power to stop the publication of Tyndale’s version of the Bible. Thousands of copies were seized by them and publicly burned at the old cross of St. Paul’s. Tyndale was kept in exile and refused many attempts to induce him to return to England, knowing that if he went back to England the bishops and other clergymen would cause his death. He was betrayed by a clergyman in Germany and was forcibly seized and imprisoned in a dungeon, and thereafter suffered much from cold and want of food; and he was taken from prison and burned at the stake. This was done at the instance of the clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But Satan and his agencies could not prevent the people from having the Bible, because God’s time had come for them to have it. Shortly after Tyndale’s death there appeared what is known as “Matthew’s Bible”. It was really Tyndale’s Bible published under a different name. Then followed the publication of what is known as the “Great Bible”, which was published in 1539; and later what is known as the “Geneva Bible”, published in 1560. All of these were but revised editions of Tyndale’s translation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the year 1611 A. D. what is commonly known as the Authorized Version was produced. It is otherwise known as the King James Version, because King James of England was the prime mover in having it prepared. The revisers who did the work were divided into six companies, and a portion of the work was assigned to each company; and every aid or help that was accessible was used by these revisers in their work. These men carefully studied the Hebrew and the Greek and the translations into the Spanish, Italian, French and German, and compared them one with the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Doubtless there has never been a more masterful and more nearly perfect English publication than the Authorized Version of the Bible. It is more generally used than any other Bible or version, of the Bible in existence. Its translation is not perfect, however, as it contains a number of mistakes, as was later shown by comparison with the ancient manuscripts. Those who prepared our Authorized Version of the Bible did not have access to the three ancient manuscripts above mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the year 1.870 A. D. a company of distinguished English scholars assembled and began the work of a revision of the Authorized Version of the Bible, and within a short time thereafter an American committee of distinguished scholars joined in a like work. When the Authorized Version was made, the ancient manuscripts, to wit, the Vatican, Alexandrine, and Sinaitic, were not accessible. The commission of revisers who prepared the Revised Version from 1870 forward had access to these manuscripts, however. The ancient manuscripts were studied, together with the various versions : and the greatest possible care and means were employed to bring forth a Bible expressing, as nearly as possible, the thought expressed by the original manuscripts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In 1881 the first edition of the English Revision was published, and in 1885 the American Revision was published. Tyndale’s translation was largely used by both of these committees, and blazed the way for the labors of the revisers. These Revised Versions are doubtless the best of all translations, because they express the thought in plain English. In addition thereto, there lias been a decided change of meaning in many of the English words during the past three hundred years. It was the effort of those who prepared the English and American Revised Versions to express the proper thought in plain English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For instance, the old English word &quot;hell” meant a dark place, such as a hole in the earth, in which one covers his vegetables for preservation. In modern times the clergy have defined hell as meaning a place of conscious torment, which of course was not the thought in the original text. Another instance: The English word '‘damnation” originally meant to judge; and sometimes to judge adversely or to condemn. The modern ecclesiastics have made the word damnation mean the consigning of one to a place of eternal torment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The translators of the Revised Version have left the word </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">hades</span><span class="font8"> untranslated, it being the word which the clergy use for hell fire and torment. The word damnation they have translated </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">judgment</span><span class="font8"> because .the word damnation in the original English, and judgment in modern English, mean the same thing; and this proves that the clergy have placed an entirely wrong meaning upon the word. (Acts 2: 27 ; John 5: 29, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">R.</span><span class="font8"> V.) In both instances, those who prepared the Authorized Version and the Revised Versions used the proper word as the word was used at the time written. It has been the clergy, however, who have seized upon the occasion to misrepresent God’s Word by improperly using it. In view of all the opposition to the Scriptures it is remarkable how pure the text has been preserved after divers and numerous copyings from the original.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Emphatic Diaglott</span><span class="font8"> is one of the purest translations of the New Testament. It is translated from the original Greek. The Vatican Manuscript was chiefly used in its preparation, reference being had also to the Sinaitic and other manuscripts. It expresses the thought in modern language and greatly aids the Greek and English student in studying the New Testament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Without doubt the invisible power of Jehovah God guided the minds and hands of faithful men of old in preparing the original manuscript of the Bible. It is God’s Word, and He had it prepared exactly right. Because it is the Word of God, Satan the evil one .has used every means within his power to destroy the Bible and to destroy those who faithfully translated it. God has permitted him to go just so far in his wicked attempts, and then has stopped the enemy. At different periods in the history of mankind honest men, wholly devoted to the Lord, have made copies of the Bible. Shall any one deny that the Lord God guided these men in their work ? We may be sure that since they were faithfully and honestly trying to represent Jehovah, He would safeguard His Word from serious error.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Satan, through his agencies, killed many of the men who faithfully performed their work, but not until after their work was done. Thousands of copies of the Bible were destroyed by these same evil agencies, but Satan with all his efforts could not stop the progress of God’s unfolding plan and the revelation of Himself to the people through His Word. Being unable to stop the publication of the Bible the Devil has sought through his representatives to corrupt the meaning thereof, and to put into the mindp of the people an improper understanding of its text. He has used every power and means to turn the minds of the people away from Jehovah and from His pure Word of Truth. For centuries many of these wonderful truths were obscured and taken away from the people by the Devil and his agencies. In God’s due time these pure doctrines have been restored to the honest seeker after truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The creature who is magnified m the Scriptures <sup>:</sup> above all others is the beloved Son of God. The Jews have, for 4000 years, centered their hopes upon the Messiah, and have looked for His appearing. For nearly 2000 years Christians have centered their hopes upon The Christ and have looked for His second corning. The beloved Son of God, the Logos, Jesus, is the Messiah, the Anointed One of God, The Christ. The time for His second appearing has come, and now He is here. With. His coming there has come to the honest seeker of truth greater light upon God’s Word, even as the Lord promised that, it should be, (Proverbs 4:18:1 Corinthians 10:11) The second presence of Christ dates from about 1874. From that time forward many of the truths long obscured by the enemy began to be restored to the honest Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As William Tyndale was used to bring the Bible to the attention of the people, so the Lord used Charles T. Russell to bring to the. attention of the people an understanding of the Bible, particularly of those truths that had been taken away by the machinations of the Devil and his agencies. Because it was the Lord’s due time to restore these truths He used Charles. T. Russell to write and publish books known as </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures</span><span class="font8"> by which the great fundamental truths of the divine plan are clarified. Satan has done his best to destroy these books because they explain the Scriptures, liven as Tyndale’s version of the Bible was destroyed by the clergy, so the clergy in various parts of the earth have gathered together thousands of volumes of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures</span><span class="font8"> and burned them publicly. But such wickedness has only served to advertise the truth of the divine plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is God’s time, when the truth shall be known, and nothing Satan can do or will be able to do can prevent the truth from being known. The time has come for the standard of Jehovah to be lifted up that the people may know which way to go. Around this divine standard the righteous and truly honest-hearted will rally. The tide of truth is rising higher and higher, and will continue to rise until it fills the whole earth as the waters fill the deep. All this shall be to the glory of Jehovah God. The time has come for Jehovah to make known His name in the earth, and He will make this known through His Word and through the manifestation of His power. And be it noted that the truth does not belong to any man. It is God’s truth. God has used men or human instruments at different times for His own purpose and to His own glory, but the truth always has been and always will be Jehovah’s. The Bible is His Word of Truth, given to guide those who seek righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Among the holy men of old who wrote prophecy was Daniel, a man much beloved by Jehovah. God moved his mind and hand to write of the marvelous things that should come to pass. Daniel did not understand what he wrote, and so stated. God gave him some evidence by which those living at the time of the fulfilment of his prophecy might understand. He locates the fulfilment as being the time of the second coming of the Lord, “the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people.” Then to Daniel he said: “But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.”—Daniel 12:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The peoples of earth on every hand see the fulfilment of this prophecy. This is the age of much running “to and fro” and great increase of knowledge. It is the time for the Scriptures to be understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After Daniel had written down the history of the world powers, and what should happen long after his day, he said: “And I heard, but I understood not; then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things?” (Daniel 12: 8) In answer to his request Jehovah replied: “Go thy way, Daniel; for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end. Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.” (Daniel 12: 9,10) Without doubt the time. lias come when the Bible is to be understood; and those who trust in God and in His Word, and in the groat sacrifice of His beloved Son, shall be purified, made clean and white, that their faithfulness to God may be established.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The “’wicked” are those who have once had some knowledge of God and who have used this knowledge for their own selfish ends. They shall not understand. This explains why the modern clergymen do not understand. The “wise”, within the meaning of Daniel’s prophecy, are those who have some knowledge of God and His Word and who apply that knowledge according to God’s holy will. These are they who humbly and joyfully obey the truth as they see it. These great and deep truths, long kept </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">secret from man, are new due to be understood; and to those who honestly seek to understand the Lord says : “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will show them his covenant [plan].''’-—Psalm 25:14. ,</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">UESTION:</span><span class="font8"> Was Jesus ever dead ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font8"> Yes. He said so Himself. In Revelation 1:18 the resurrected Christ Jesus said, “I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore.” In Romans 6:9 we read, “Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> If an individual has taken a certain oath to remain loyal to a certain religion, and afterwards comes to a knowledge of the truth and recognizes the former religion as error and out of harmony with the Bible, will the heavenly Father forgive such an individual if he determines to do the Lord’s will thereafter ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font8"> Yes. To turn from a course of error and cling to the truth is always approved by the Lord. The Lord will forgive the individual making the oath in ignorance, and before one came to a knowledge of the truth. Let us remember that a Wise man who sees the error of his ways is willing to change to the truth seven times a day; but a fool, never. The Christian himself expects chastening and correction from the Lord, and he rejoices to follow the instructions of the Lord. In Proverbs 3:11-13 we read: “My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord; neither be weary of his correction: for whom the Lord loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth. Happy is the man that findeth rvisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> In Matthew 4-: 10 we read, “Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shall thnn serve.” Should we worship Jesus or God or both?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">'Answer:</span><span class="font8"> While it is perfectly proper to honor Jesus, the highest praises are due to Jehovah because He is God, and because all things and creatures -were brought into existence for the purpose of praising Him. In Psalm 145:10 we read, “AU thy works shall praise thee, 0 Lord; and thy saints shall bless thee.” Eventually all the obedient of mankind will praise Jehovah God. This will be accomplished at the end of Christ’s kingdom. We read in Psalm 67:3-7, “Let all the people praise thee, 0 God; let all the people praise thee. 0 let the nations be glad, and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah. Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee. Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us. God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font8"> Please explain Genesis 22:1,2 a portion of which reads, “God did tempt Abraham . . . and he said, Take now’ thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.” Then reconcile this with James 1:13 'which states, “Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempt-eth he any man.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font8"> In Genesis 22:1,2 Jehovah God tested the faith of Abraham. God has a perfect right </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">to try</span><span class="font8"> the loyalty of an individual who is on trial, in order that good may result. It is through the many trials that the faith of the individual is made stronger and stronger, and as a result God is able to determine the heart loyalty of the individual. We will note from Genesis 22:1,2, wo do imt read that God tempted 'Abraham that evil might result; God tries the individual that good may result. On the other hand, the Apostle James is speaking<sup>-</sup> of the temptation that is based upon evil design, which if 'yielded to leads to sin and unhappiness. One can truly say that God does not tempt any one with evil, nor does He tempt any man from an evil motive.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark161"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark162"></a>The Children’s Own Radio Story</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Story Eight</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font8">E HAVE now come to the part of our story of the life of Jesus, God’s Son, where we leave the account of Him as a baby and hear of His first wonderful adventure as a young boy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Yon know that there is a Jewish holiday called the Passover. This is a feast in remembrance of something that occurred away back in the days when Moses was at the head of the Children of Israel. It was at the time of their sojourn in the land of Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Lord was ready for the Israelites to be delivered from the hands of the Egyptians. He caused Moses to tell the people that a sacrifice should be made. This sacrifice was the killing of a lamb, which was then to be eaten roasted by the people who partook of the sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The blood of the lamb was- to be sprinkled upon the door posts of the houses wherein the Israelites dwelt. That the Lord had a reason for this we shall presently see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now it was the Lord’s purpose to free the Israelites from their Egyptian captors, and this is how He did it. In the night following the observance of the lamb-sacrifice the angel of the Lord God passed over Egypt with a great and sudden plague, killing all the first-born of the Egyptians, and even the first-born of their cat tle. From the great palace of Pharaoh to the humblest hut of the Egyptian laborers, nothing hut wailing was heard. The Lord had punished those people for their cruelty to the Israelites, the worst of which was the drowning of every little Israelite boy baby as soon as it was born.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But Jehovah had warned the people,, through Moses, to stay within doors on that certain night, and lo, the great and terrible plague with which the Lord smote Egypt </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">-passed over</span><span class="font8"> the houses whereon the blood of the sacrificed lamb had been sprinkled. The children of Israel were untouched by the terrible plague which slew all the first-born of Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ the Egyptians were then glad to let the Israelites go, and Jehovah (led commanded that hence for ever the feast of the Passover, as it was called. It was observed once a year by all Israelites and their descendants. Thus it came about that Mary and Joseph went every year to Jerusalem to observe the passover feast, and they took Jesus with them. He was by this time quite a big boy, strong, and beautiful, and very bright, because He was perfect and was blessed by the grace of Jehovah, His Father,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Jesus was twelve years of age, Mary and Joseph went up to Jerusalem as usual, and He accompanied them. When they had observed the passover in the manner commanded by the Lord God in His word to Moses, Mary and Joseph set forth on their return journey to Nazareth. They did not notice until they had gone a long way, that Jesus was not with them, for they were traveling with a large company of relatives and friends who had come up to Jerusalem to partake of the passover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When they discovered that Jesus was missing from the company, they turned back the way they had come and once more entered the gates of Jerusalem. For three days Joseph and Mary searched the city, high and low, and then found the boy Jesus sitting in the temple in the midst of a gathering of wise men and priests, listening to their discourse and asking them questions so difficult that they could not answer, to their very great surprise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Bible tells us of this incident: “And it came to pass, that after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions. And all that heard him were aston-ished at his understanding and answers. And when they saw him, they were amazed, and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? Behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing. And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? Wist ye not that I must be about my Father’s business? And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You see, when Jesus spoke of His “Father’s business”, He referred to the purpose with which He had left His high place as the Logos and come to the earth. Joseph had not sent Jesus into the temple on any business, so naturally he and the others were at loss to understand this statement of the young boy Jesus.-But Jesus Himself knew, through the grace of God. that He had a great and wonderful purpose to fulfil, which was the business of Almighty God, His Father. And though He was a human, being, He was perfect, for He was the Son of God just as truly as when He sat at Jehovah’s right hand in heaven.</span></p>
