<p><span class="font17">W</span><span class="font12">HEN Jacob sent his sons on their second trip to Egypt he sent along with them a little present to the man who had spoken so gruffly to them, but who had nevertheless returned their money. The present included almonds and pistachio-nuts, showing that even back there they had discovered that humans enjoy these goodies. Walnuts are mentioned in Canticles 6:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">More nuts would be eaten, except that there do not seem to be enough of them to go around. They are becoming more plentiful, and people are giving more attention to them as a staple food. Nuts are so rich, having practically no waste in their composition, that they should be eaten as a part of the main meal, with other J| substances having greater bulk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Vegetarians point to the lithe, active squirrel and recommend the eating of nuts for reducing the abdomen and increasing agility. It is estimated that New Yorkers spend about $40,000,000 a year on nuts.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Almonds—-Beechnuts—Bens</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">&lt; A LMONDS, both sweet and bitter, are native of of Asia Minor, Northern Africa and Southern Europe. California is producing the finest almonds in the market today and has made more progress in nut culture in the past ten years than has been made on the shores of the Mediterranean in ten centuries. The almond is America's most popular nut. Large quantities are imported from Spain and France. Chocolate almond bars, chocolates with almond centers, and ice-cream with burnt al</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">m</span><span class="font12">ond flavoring, are among the good things familiar to • most Americans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Beechnuts are well known to the boys and girls of the highlands of New York state. These little triangular express packages of toothsomeness arc particularly good roasted, but the city dwellers know little little about them, except that</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">they are used as trade names to advertise chewing gum and bacon. Holland has just taken official notice of the beechnut and will hereafter increase the edible oils of the country by gathering and using these delightful little parcels of food dropped by the beeches at the end of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Ben-nuts, from the East Indies, are used as sources of oil.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">ETEL-NUTS, fruit of the areca palm, in the East Indies and the Philippines, are used as a vermifuge and are also said to have stimulant and tonic properties. The natives utilize betel-nuts as coat buttons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Bladdernuts, of Central Europe, are worn as beads of necklaces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Bonduc-nuts, of India, are also used as beads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Boomah-nuts, of Africa, are used for tanning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Brazil-nuts, or nigger-toes, as they are sometimes called, constitute the seeds of a majestic tree whose habitat is Venezuela and Northern</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Brazil. They grow together in a pod, woven about each other so closely that the ingenuity of man is incapable of putting them back into the pod when they have once been removed from it. The aborigines gather these from the jungles and bring them to the river ports, whence the river steamers carry them to the coast. New York uses twenty thousand tons a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Breadnuts grow on a tree in Jamaica and make good food.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Butternuts—Candlemts—Carob-Beans</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">TJIITTERNUTS, sometimes called while wal-nuts, are grown in the United States. They are so rich that not many can be eaten at one time. Brazil and British Guiana also have a butternut sometimes called the souari or sn-warrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Candlenuts, of the South Sea Islands, are used as sources- of oil. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>

The carol) is quite familiar throughout the Old World, where it has saved whole tribes and races from starvation and has been utilized as the basic ration for armies. It has just been introduced in California. It needs no irrigating, fumigating, fertilizing nor pruning. If it is once properly planted it will take care of itself, and prefers to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cashew-Nuts—Chestnuts— Cobnuts</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">C</span><span class="font12">ASHEWS come mostly from India, although small quantities come in from the West Indies, Mexico and South America. Besides be' ing much enjoyed for its edible qualities the cashew<sup>7</sup> is a source of oil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Chestnuts once grew in abundance in the Eastern and the Southern states. The Spanish variety is found in Southern Europe, Northern Africa and 'Western Asia. It is a?; important item in the food supply of France and Italy, being eaten raw<sup>7</sup>, boiled, roasted, and in porridges and cakes. In Korea the chestnut serves as a substitute for the potato. Chestnuts are good, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The blight of the American chestnut t-ee by infection from Japanese nursery stock in 1904 is one of the greatest tragedies in the tree life of the Western world. The present indications are that this blight, which the Japanese and Chinese trees resist fairly well, will destroy every American chestnut tree. The Department of Agriculture estimates that this will take only about, ten years more. If that calamity should occur the cheerful chestnut roaster will disappear from New<sup>7</sup> York streets, where it has been a factor every November and December within the memory of all now’ living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.......</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Chestnuts are used as a substitute for cereals, and in various parts of the world' the oil is used in cooking. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“</span></p>

And when it is meal time, and you are hungry, what is so maddening as to have somebody crack and eat a few, especially ■ when the very first one makes your mouth water? And when you have eaten one, where is the place to stop? Fresh roasted peanuts have about the most “moreish” taste of any article of human food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Dr. George Washington Carver, of Tuskegee Institute, Alabama, one of the leading chemists of the world, a modest, gentle negro, regards the peanut as man’s universal food. A legume, with power to bring nitrogen from the air, it is a soil-builder, rather than a soil-robber.</span></p>

These discoveries include ten kinds of milk, two grades of flour, two grades of meal, five break-— fast foods, three relishes, nine wood stains, Worcestershire sauce, several kinds of oils, face powder, face cream, food flavorings, pastries, confections, stock foods, tonics, punches, etc. One of the milks obtained looks like milk, tastes like milk, and will yield butter and cheese just like cow’s milk.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font12">F PEANUTS are entitled to a separate subhead, so are pecans, the most popular of American nuts, and the most important item in nut exports. Plant-breeders have developed from the bitter hard-shelled seedling the choice paper-shell product for which retailers ask eighty cents a pound. The finest grades come from Georgia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The pecan surpasses all other nuts in the percentage of fat, having 70.7 percent. This is more than six times as much as is contained in round steak and nearly twice as much as is contained in cheese. It is seven times as much as<sub>: </sub>is contained in boiled eggs. It also contains 12.1 percent of protein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is now about ninety years since a Spaniard named Delmas settled in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and found a nut tree growing wild on his plantation. He liked the nuts, cultivated them, and thus gave the paper-shelled pecan its start in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Before his death Luther Burbank declared that if he were a young man he would go to Texas, and knowing the possibilities of the pecan industry, would devote his life to it. He considered the pecan superior to any other nut and sure to repay well those who give it attention. Pecans can be grafted upon the worthless pignuts, which grow wild in northern states.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b. F. J. W. Whipple, seismologist at Kew Observatory, London, referring to the Jan</span><span class="font12">uary earthquakes in Switzerland, the February earthquakes in Palestine and Portugal, the March earthquakes in Italy, Turkey and Persia, and the April earthquakes in Mexico, Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece, declares that there have been more disasters of this kind in Europe in the last few<sup>T</sup> months than there had previously been for many years. The double earthquake at Corinth has completely ruined the city and destroyed the hopes of its former inhabitants <sub>: </sub>of ever rebuilding it. The Manchester </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian </span><span class="font12">notes one hopeful sign in all these sorrows when, it says: “It would almost seem that man is learning his lesson, for the one consoling feature of the disaster is the prompt forgetfulness of political strife and the immediate offer from old enemies of aid to the homeless.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">rpiIE apostle, in speaking of the ancient wor-• thies, reminds us that some of these &quot;wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth” (Hebrews 11:38); so it seems proper to take a brief glance at some of these dens and caves thus honored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Lot made his home in a cave after he fled _. from S‘K'om. The five kings of the Amorites-made their headquarters in a cave at Makkedah when they fled from Joshua. In the days preceding Gideon’s deliverance practically all Israel were living in &quot;the deiis which are in the mountains,. and the caves, and the strong holds”. (Judges 6: 2) During the reign of King Saul a similar condition prevailed, through fear of the Philistines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">David and four hundred of his men made their home in the cave of Adullam, when Saul was searching for him to kill him. It was in such a cave that David had the opportunity to take the life of his enemy but spared him, because David was a man after God’s own heart, benevolent, kind.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Caves were much used as places of interment by the Israelites,, due in considerable measure to the fact that the soil is rocky in the Holy Land and in places rock-hewn tombs or natural caves seem to provide the most natural means of interment. Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Rebecca, Jacob and Leah were all buried in the cave of Machpelah, at Hebron, zealously guarded by the Arabs to thL very day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■........As caves are usually dry, well ventilated and</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">of fairly even temperature hire the year around they have not only become natural hiding places for individuals fleeing from persecution or punishment, but have been much utilized by smugglers and robbers and by great companies of refugees in times of war and disaster.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">In southwestern China, about the headwaters of the Yangtse Kiang, are great numbers of caverns which bear evidences of occupation by thousands in times of war, while in the provinces of ■ Kan-Su -and Shen-Si great numbers of similar caverns are excavated in the .hillside, and even today, are favorite dwellings of the people. - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">.There are many and various causes for the formation of caves. Those in limestone and gypsum are the results of the dissolving power of water that is charged with carbonic acid. Limestone caves are marked by stalactites (limestone “icicles” hanging from the roof) and stalagmites (similar “icicles” projecting upward from the floor). Many limestone caves contain remnants of the bones of hyenas, elephants and bears. -Caves of gypsum often contain foul air. Trachyte. and lava caves were evidently caused by gas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Some caves contain myriads of bats, a whirring multitude that it taxes the -powers of language to describe. Some caves thus long occupied contain vast deposits of guano, extensively used as fertilizer in some places. The ancient tombs of Egypt abound with a form of bat known as the tomb-bat.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">J T IS not to be wondered at that great use has been made- of caves in the world’s center for wars, strife and hypocrisy masquerading under the name of religion. Throughout southern Europe the old feudal castles stand in high isolated positions on rods which are drilled through and through-with, galleries and chambers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On the approach of foes the lord of the castle gathered in his retainers and in a few hours these vast underground chambers were filled with plows, looms, bedding, garments, household utensils of every sort, sheep, oxen, horses and whimpering women and children. History records horrible tales of these fugitives suffocated by smoke in their caves or walled up by their enemies and left to starve.■</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In France there are thousands of such places, mostly under churches and castles. . There are forty-nine such: places in the department of</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Vienne alone. There are churches and other so-called religious institutions in America which have such places and they are being added to every year. These places have made ideal torture chambers and were so used in the days of the Spanish Inquisition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One of the most gorgeous European caverns is that of Antipharos in the Greek archipelago. On one occasion a throng of five hundred persons descended into this grotto, where they passed three days. The roof is adorned with stalactites, many of them twenty feet long, and hung with festoons of various forms and brilliant appearance. In some parts immense columns descend to the floor; others present the appearance of trees and brooks turned to marble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There are a number of caves in the rock of Gibraltar, one of them, St. Michael’s cave, being many feet above the sea. The Ghar Dalam cave at Malta contains many relics of antiquity and is being fitted up for visitors. The Grotto del Cane, on Lake Agnano, Naples, Italy, exhales deadly fumes in which, in ancient days, many poor slaves were, suffocated by their masters. There are caves in southern Europe through which great winds sweep, playing like invisible musicians on an organ of rock columns.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">MONG the thousand or more caverns or rock shelters of France there are over one hundred that contain prehistoric paintings, engravings or sculptures. Fully a hundred more have furnished good samples of flint and bone industry, as well as bones of animals long extinct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At Troo, 150 miles south, of Paris, the little city of that name is built in the base of a cliff of chalk and most of the .homes are built wholly or partly underground. The valley of the Loire abounds in such rock villages, and they occur in many other places in France, Spain and northern Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">For the most part the people living in such homes are poor and often degraded, yet many of these places are the homes of families of honest, workers, decently furnished and ornamented outwardly by ledge gardens, hanging vines and neatly curtained window’s.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">At Crozon, on the coast of Brittany, is a most beautiful cave opening out of the sea. Its roof is lined with slabs of emerald green marble. Its walls are a mass of white, lilac and gray, with intervening streaks of red. Its floor is strewn with red and yellow boulders, and upon that floor, according to tradition, several explorers have been trapped by the swift rising tides and drowned.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Within the past iwoj'ears important caves have been discovered ih Chatham and Derbyshire, England. The one in Chatham contained four thousand hammer stones, flint axes and scrapers and other wmrked flints, and was one of the arsenals of long ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In Nottingham and Staffordshire, England, thousands of habitations, stables and workshops were cut in the hillsides, and many of these were occupied until, within a few years, the local health authorities required them to be vacated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One of the grandest natural caverns of Scotland is Fingal’s Cave, in Straffa, one of the Western Islands. Its sides are of basaltic columns which are almost as regular as hewm stone. In a cave on the island of Eigg the Laird of MacLeod entrapped two hundred libertyloving men wdio refused to bow’ dowm to him and suffocated them all by building a huge fire in the mouth of the cave and allowing the smoke to drift into its farthest recesses.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="text-decoration:underline;">W</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">HE</span><span class="font12">N thinking of caves in'America one naturally thinks first of that great abyss, Mammoth Cave, in Kentucky. Only 150 miles of this cave has been explored, so that its true dimensions are not known, except that it is known that its aerial diameter exceeds ten miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The main cave is three miles long. Its greatest enlargement is known as the Temple, an oval room 541 feet long, 287 feet wide and 125 feet high. The Indians used this as a rendezvous and have left their torches and other relics in abundance. The Star chamber mimics the starry heavens by reason of its lofty ceiling of black oxide of manganese flecked by snowy crystals of gypsum. The entire cave was once sold for $40. It is to become a national park.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Everywhere in Mammoth Cave the atmosphere is chemically and optically pure and of the uniform temperature of 54 degrees, winter and summer. In summer the air flows outward from the cave; and in winter it flows inward. Years ago it was believed that this air was specially good for lung sufferers, but the theory has been abandoned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Mammoth Cave contains seventy-four species of blind creatures, the most interesting of which is a blind fish, four inches long, colorless. The fish seeks the dark and shuns the light, being much disturbed by any ray of light. All trace of. the eye of this fish disappears after it reaches two inches in length. European caverns contain several hundred species of blind creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During the Civil War a Negro husband and wife broke away from their plantation and started north. Pursued to Mammoth. Cave they disappeared into its gloom. Their pursuers sent for bloodhounds and traced them from cavern to cavern and from hall to hall until finally they made their last stand on the edge of the Bottomless Pit. As the bloodhounds closed upon them the two poor slaves were seen to join hands and leap together into oblivion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Kentucky has many caverns and great ones. Colossal Cavern, the entrance of which is only one and one-half miles from Mammoth Cave, is of immense size, a worthy rival of Mammoth Cave. It is owned by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company, which purchased it in 1896, a year after its discovery. Few Kentucky caves have been explored to any distance and many of them are inaccessible to visitors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is believed that many of the larger caves are interconnected; but exploration has been only partial, hence this is not surely known. It was in an effort at such general cave exploration that Floyd Collins a few years ago became firmly fastened in a narrow passage and died in spite of all attempts at rescue.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Retail business requires credits in such form as may be passed from hand to hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">An ideal form of circulating money bears this statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For Value Received</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">-—The United States of America—</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Promises to pay to bearer on demand . . . Dollars, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">All of our paper money is United States government notes. Should the issue be five billion dollars, each dollar will be secured by a government reserve of sixty dollars in good, tangible property and a reputation for integrity exceeding that of any or all banking institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">-Unfortunately (with a very slight exception) not one dollar of this money ever reaches a citizen until the dollar has passed through the banks and the citizen has paid tribute with his note, discounted at six percent 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The issue, travels and redemption of a good government five-dollar note may be illustrated as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I am a government clerk, performing service which has been determined to be worth five dollars a day; and in exchange for service rendered by me I accept a government credit note for five dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I purchase meat from the butcher, and he accepts my government credit note in payment, thus fully discharging the government’s debt to me, but transferring it to the butcher. The butcher purchases bread from the baker, who accepts the government note, thus fully -discharging the government’s debt to the butcher, but transferring it to the baker; and so on, from hand to hand, with each holder of the note except the last one, who is to have the government’s debt to him fully paid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In due time the government gives notice that </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">its</span><span class="font12"> services to the people must be paid for; and tax bills are sent to them. The taxpayer holding the five-dollar note originally paid to me for service rendered </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font12"> the government, presents the note; and it is accepted in full payment for service rendered </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">by</span><span class="font12"> the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Though the government’s redemption of its obligation to me has been deferred one year, it has finally been redeemed as pay for taxes. Meanwhile the note itself has often been materially redeemed by various citizens who have been abundantly remunerated in the use of a convenient, unimpeachable and “perfect medium of exchange”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The history of this five-dollar note is practically the history of every note issued by the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Briefly stated, the condition is as follows: About the year 1863, a combination of banks loaned to this government one billion dollars, for which they received one billion dollars in interest-bearing bonds, and a quantity of circulating notes (designated “national bank notes”) which have averaged $800,000,000 a year. To get these notes into circulation, they are loaned by the banks to the people on their notes discounted at six percent, so that during sixty-five years the people have paid direct to the banks on their discounted notes $3,120,000,000, and at three percent interest on bonds, $1,560,000,000, making a total paid to the national banks $4,680,000,000, and the original billion-dollar loan still remains unpaid! And this agreement is still working!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Federal Reserve System was organized in the year 1913. Their circulating notes are explicitly “'obligations of the United States Government”. These notes are loaned by the banks to the people on their promissory notes at a discount of six percent, and these identical notes are deposited with the government as collateral, and the banks receive an equal amount of circulating notes without charge!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If these notes average three billion dollars a year, during the fifteen years of the system the people will have paid, at six percent, $2,700;-000,000, to the banks for the use of their own money! besides that paid-to the national banks, $4,680,000,000, making a total paid, for which no value has been received, $7,380,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">.The remedy for this great injustice is so simple as to be almost unbelievable, thus:</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">W</span><span class="font12">E GLEAN the following thoughts from an article which appeared in a recent issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The National Republic:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The flags and drums used in 1775 by the American forces in the Revolutionary War bore a rattlesnake insignia and the motto, “Don’t Tread on Me.” Benjamin Franklin was much impressed with it, and set about trying to fathom its symbolical meaning’. He wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">‘T sat down to guess what could have been intended by this uncommon device. I took care, however, to consult, on this occasion, a person aecpiainted with heraldry, from whom I learned that it is a rule, among the learned in that science, ‘that the worthy properties of the animal, in the crest borne,’ shall be considered; he likewise informed me that the ancients considered the serpent as an emblem of wisdom, and, in a certain attitude, of endless duration— both of which circumstances, 1 suppose, may have been had in view. Having gained this intelligence, and recollecting that countries are sometimes represented by animals peculiar to them, it occured to me that the rattlesnake is found in no other quarter of the world besides America, and may, therefore, have been chosen on that account to represent her. But then the worthy properties of the snake, I judge, would be hard to point out. This rather raised than suppressed my curiosity; and having frequently seen the rattlesnake, I ran over in my mind every property by which she was distinguished, not only from other animals, but from those of the same genus or class of animals, endeavoring to fix some meaning to each, not wholly inconsistent with common sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“I recollected that her eyes excelled in brightness that of any other animal, and that she had no eyelids. She may, therefore, be esteemed an emblem of vigilance. She never begins an attack, nor, when once engaged, ever surrenders. She is, therefore, an emblem of magnanimity and true courage. As if anxious to prevent all pretentions&quot; of quarreling with her, the weapons with which nature has furnished her she conceals in the roof of her mouth, so that, to those who are unacquainted with her, she appears to be a defenceless animal; and even when those weapons are shown, and extended for defence, they appear weak and contemptible; but their wounds, however small, are decisive and fatal. Conscious of this, she never wounds till she has generously given notice, even to her enemy, and^autioned him against the danger of treadin^lm her. Was I wrong-, sir, in thinking this a strong picture of the temper and conduct of America ? The poison, of her teeth is the necessary means of digesting her food, and at the same time is certain destruction to her enemies. This may be understood to intimate that those things which are destruction to our enemies, may be to us not only harmless, but absolutely necessary to our existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“I confess I was wholly at a loss what to make of the rattles, till I went back and counted them, and found them just thirteen, exactly the number of the colonies united in America; and I recollected, too, that this was the only part of the snake which increased in number. Perhaps it might be only fancy, but I conceived the painter had shown a half-formed additional rattle; which, I suppose, may have been intended to represent the province.of Canada. ’Tis curious and amazing to observe how distinct and independent of each other the rattles of this animal are, and yet how firmly they are uni ted together, so as never to be separated but by breaking them to pieces. One of the rattles singly is incapable of producing sound; but the ring of thirteen together is sufficient to alarm the boldest man living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“The rattlesnake is solitary, and associates with her kind only when it is necessary for their preservation. In winter the warmth of a number together will preserve their lives; while, singly, they would probably perish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“The power of fascination attributed to her, by a generous construction may be understood to mean that those who consider the liberty and blessings which America affords, and once come over to her, never afterwards leave her, but spend their lives with her. She strongly resembles America in this, that she is beautiful in her youth, and her beauty increaseth with her age. 'Her tongue is also blue, and forked as the lightning, and her abode is among impenetrable rocks.’ ” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To the foregoing we add the following thoughts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One of America’s mottoes is, “Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty,” represented by the brightness-of the serpent’s eyes. Like the serpent in question, she is extremely loath to attack unless unduly, provoked, and she has never yet surrendered to another nation. Compared with other big nations, her military defense has always seemed inadequate, “weak and contemptible” in the eyes of militarism, indicated by the defenceless appearance of the snake: but like its bite, her attacks have always proven effective in defeating her enemies. And as the rattlesnake warns of the danger of treading on her, so America gives ample warning to her foes before declaring war; as, for example, in the late World War. What a tremendous whirr and buzz went up from her forty-eight rattles before she struck in 19171 In note after note, the head of the serpent warned her foe, but to no avail. She “generously” gave notice of her intention to strike. In harmony with the fact that the rattles are the only part of the snake which increase in number, this symbolical rattlesnake has grown forty-eight large and well-developed rattles, all of which are “distinct and independent of each other” as free and independent states, but “firmly united together” in a common purpose, represented in the Federal government. They could be rendered impotent only by separation. But the “ring” of all together is “sufficient to alarm the boldest” nation in existence. America is solitary and isolated; she has no “associates&quot; except in war, when she thinks it necessary to preserve her own existence. In </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font12"> winter time of trouble, as in the great war, she seeks the company of other symbolical serpents, but leaves them as soon as the necessity for such association is over. She avoids “entangling alliances”, or friendships with other countries. This was pointed out by a great French statesman recently, who said that his people did not understand America’s peculiar attitude in this respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">And how true it is that America, exerts a strange power of fascination over the immigrant, which impels him to remain with, her! , Viewed from the standpoint of the world, she is indeed beautiful, just as the serpent is regarded with admiration by certain religious cults, notably the Satanists, of Paris, whose leader wears a snake around her neck for a necklace. The Scriptures seem to refer to this country in the verse quoted by Franklin. Truly, “her abode is among impenetrable rocks” in the sense of her geographical position of isolation. No nation has ever yet invaded this “impenetrable” abode successfully; and it -was Lincoln who said that if the Old World should pool her wealth, combine her armies, and place a Napoleon at her head, they could not make a track on the Blue Eidge or take a drink out of the Ohio “in a trial of a thousand years”, so “impenetrable” is America’s position among the nations of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We would dissent from Franklin’s view that the undeveloped rattle represented Canada; rather, we would suppose that it was a prediction of the growth of the United States into more than thirteen colonies; and we see that this has been signally fulfilled. There is little likelihood that either Canada or Mexico will ever become a part of this symbolical rattlesnake, although this is not an impossibility, and there are forces at work with such an end in view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Now the question<sup>111</sup>' arises,'“'Who made this prophecy, and &quot;who invented these wonderful correspondencies? for there is nothing fanciful or far-fetched in- the whole picture: it is an accurate symbolical representation of the United States. The answer is that Satan, anxious to have some tremendously impressive symbol of himself, the cunning serpent, somewhere in his empire, is the inspire! of it, A con-</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font12"> FRIEND in California who knows the inside of the raisin game includes in a letter the following expression, which we have no doubt some readers of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font12"> may note to their profit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A very practical advice would be to tell each and every sensible raisin grower to resign from the Associa-„ tion at the very first “resigning” period which the contract allows (and it took II. S. Federal action to put these resigning periods into the contract, by the way), because woe to those who are members of the Association when it falls: the bankers will take away the very clothes off their backs in order to cover the millions the Association takes below the surface when it sinks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font10"> feels like rendering the raisin growers a service, why not a heading and a paragraph or two in the following style:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Sun-Maid Raisin Growers Have Rough Going</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Farmers’ cooperative selling organizations seem to have the usual run of bad luck in their management and financial, returns to farmer-members. The reason seems plain. The cooperatives lack the intensely practical and self-seeking management of a firm operating along the usual non-cooperative lines. With mankind what it is. where hundreds or thousands of more or less unappreciative and more or less suspicious individuals comprise a giant cooperative, there is not the keen incentive on the part of the management to reduce overhead expenses, to weed out nonproducing employees, and to secure the highest possible returns for their produce with the least possible expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Result: First, the officials at the head of the cooperative become lax and easy going; second, they discover perfectly “legitimate” little ways of lining their own pockets at the expense of the farmers; third, these petty methods of graft grow into great wrongs whereby millions of dollars are robbed from the groaning ranchers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If information which conies to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font12"> from seemingly reliable sources is correct, an unsatisfactory &quot;&nbsp;condition exists among the raisin growers of California and in their cooperative, Sun-Maid Raisin Growers. A giant raisin-marketing cooperative, organized in 1912-|||of California  Associated Raisin Co., for some years gave the farmers fairly good returns. The high prices of the world-war period, succeeded by the 1918-1919 craze of high raisin prices immediately after the Prohibition Amendment, gave the raisin growers high hopes that </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">their</span><span class="font12"> cooperative would prove the exception to the rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But when the inevitable slump struck, it struck hard. Raisin prices went down. Hundreds lost vineyards that represented life-time earnings. Reorganized in 1921 under the name of &quot;Sun-Maid Raisin Growers”, the farmers’ cooperative made a brave rally. Immense advertising campaigns made the name of &quot;SunMaid Raisins” widely known; and the growers for years gladly paid the bills, bills running into many millions of dollars, while they themselves struggled along at starvation returns of 31c and less a pound for their raisins, hoping that relief was just around the corner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">However, it is now alleged, by those who should know, that certain abuses have crept into the management </span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">Al</span><span class="font12">t is also alleged that, should this mammotlwrganization go bankrupt, with almost 50% of the raisin growers as its members, these members and shareholders would be billed for their proportionate share of the losses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">From the perspective of some 2,000 miles, it would appear to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font12"> editors that the discontented raisin grower’s easiest way out would be to jerk out his grape vines, a few acres each year so as not to make a too-sudden change, and plant other crops that seem to promise better returns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Many farmers, of course, will keep on growing grapes and making raisins, but will take advantage of their forthcoming withdrawal period, allowed in their. cont.ra.cts, and will withdraw<sup>7 </sup>from the Sun-Maid Raisin Growers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This will delight the “independent” or privately-managed raisin packers.-At present these “independents” invariably give the vineyardist higher prices than the cooperative does. But their love for the grower is akin to the love of a pack of hungry wolves for a nice, juicy baby</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Iamb, as their past history has abundantly • proved. In the good old pre-Association days, raisins sold for 5e a pound one year and 1½e a pound or less the next. Some, however, will prefer to battle with this up-and-down market condition rather than the slowly demoralizing, consistently starvation returns that the Sun</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">AST October I was told by a reputable physician that my blood pressure was so low that any sudden shock and I “would pass out of the picture”. Walking a city block was real hard labor for my heart, and stairs were impossible, even had I wanted to disregard the doctor’s orders, which were not to try them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">After reading your article on “Aluminum” in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font12"> about the 30th of November, we left off cooking in aluminum from that hour. In three months, December, January and February, my blood pressure rose from 110 to 120, and I could actually </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">feel</span><span class="font12"> how much better I felt every morning than I had felt the day before. My nerves stopped hurting me; my vision steadily improved. I had previously stopped trying to do any physical work, but I resumed light tasks and the exercise I have taken all my life, and some garden work. On the first of March my blood pressure was 120.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">All last summer I took sun baths and was on a special diet without improvement. I could not increase the number of red blood corpuscles whose absence was causing all my trouble. I continued all these helps to health all winter. The first of March I added many walnuts to my diet, and Dr. Russel’s Green Bone, with many oranges, apples and lemons. On the 30th Maid Raisin Growers doles out to its hopeful but hungry members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Either way, the farmer always gets the rough end of the deal while a few individuals roll up fat bank accounts, roll around in big cars, and live in beautiful homes that put king’s castles to shame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">By Gladys Barady</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">of March my blood pressure had risen from 120 to 130, in one month! It is now normal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the days of my slavery, to aluminum poisoning I had to have ten to twelve hours a day in bed and then I got up tired. Now I can stay up till nine or ten o’clock; which seems perfectly marvelous after you’ve had to go to bed at seven for three or .four years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Your fearlessness in publishing these “Aluminum” articles has literally saved my life and helped me to become once more a useful member of society. You are welcome to publish this so that I can do my little part to help others as you have helped me. Also I must acknowledge in a personal letter to Dr. Charles T. Betts and the other doctors whose opinions you publish, my undying gratitude for their honesty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">You have my thanks, which seem utterly inadequate to show you what I feel about this thing you are doing and what you have done for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Needless to state, but if ten thousand doctors swore on ten thousand Bibles that aluminum ware is harmless to human beings, I would not believe them, for my own experience has proved that it is a deadly but very slow and insidious poison through which I was losing my life and which worked in a fashion so subtle that no one could discover what was the matter.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">T HAVE studied medicine considerably and so A have come into contact with a good many medical men, one of whom was Dr. W. G. Scott, of Los Angeles, a close friend, a real authority mi smallpox.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the Civil War he was in charge of the government hospital at Memphis, Tenn., where he had thousands of smallpox eases pass • through his hands. Afterwards he was in charge of similar work in Mobile, Ala.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">He said to me, in effect : “I have attended thousands of smallpox cases, the vaccinated and the unvaccinated, and one had the disease as bad as the other, notwithstanding the vaccination or its time. Of twenty-one who died in the smallpox epidemic of 1898-1899, eighteen died of vaccination. I knew of one case, that of a young woman, with a little sister and a father to support. She worked in a department store and was compelled to submit to vaccination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">She died in three days. I myself never was vaccinated, never took the disease, never was afraid of it and was only careful to keep my blood and stomach in healthy condition by physical exercise, proper food and regular hours.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Dr. Scott was my intimate personal friend from 1895 to the time of his death. If this is not enough, ask for more and I will write more. If such evidence is not good, where would you seek it? On one occasion Dr. Scott said to me, “T do not believe it is necessary to put one loathsome disease into the human system to’keep another out.”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark218"></a>Bible Questions asid Answers</span></h6>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">QUESTION:</span><span class="font12"> In what sense was Jesus the only begotten’Son of God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font12"> Jesus is the only begotten Son of God because, the Bible teaches, He is the firstborn and only direct creation of God. In Colossians 1:15 we read: ‘'‘[The Son of God] is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: for by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and. for him.” In speaking of Christ Jesus the heavenly Father says in Psalm 89:27, “I will make him miy firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.” The Scriptures teach that before; He came to earth He was with the Father as the Logos. As the Logos He was a mighty spirit being and was the agent of the heavenly Father in the creation of all things. Subsequently the Son of God came to earth to become man’s Redeemer. At the age of thirty He was begotten by Jehovah to the divine nature, when He came to Jordan. After His crucifixion He was raised in resurrection a mighty spirit being. The only begotten Son of Jehovah has been the treasure of the Almighty God. He has been the Father's agent in the creation of all things except Himself, and He will be the Father’s chief representative in the ages to come. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;„•</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Question-:</span><span class="font12"> Was Jesus while on earth true God and true man?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">. 'Ans-wer:</span><span class="font12"> No. While on earth Jesus was a perfect man, and except Adam before he sinned, the only perfect man that ever existed on earth. On account, of His obedience in doing the will of the heavenly Father, Jesus was the greatest man that ever lived. The Bible teaches us that there is only, one personage who is God, and that is Jehovah, the Father of Jesus. In 1 Timothy 2:5 we read: “There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.” In John 17:3 we read: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” The Bible here clearly states that there is but one person, who is God, and He is the Father of Jesus. Furthermore, it was God who sent Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ was not God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font12"> How do you Bible Students study the Bible? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.......</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font12"> A Christian should study the Bible | topically. By topical Bible study we mean a thorough study of on a  subject at a time. For instance, it may be a good thing to take a concordance and turn to the word “God”, and find the passages giving information about that Being. The important scriptures may be carefully studied. After that subject is thoroughly understood, the subject of Jesus, the Son of God, Christ, or any term relative to this Being may be examined in the same way. Now this would be very laborious; but if there would not be any other means it would be highly profitable. But Bible Studies containing a topical digest of different Bible subjects are now published by the International Bible Students Association and may be secured at a very low cost. One of the publications, called </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God,</span><span class="font12"> is an excellent book for beginning this study. In this literature the scriptures are cited and in many instances the quotations are made. This literature does not take the place of the Bible, but it is a topical discussion of the Bible. The Christian should accept as truth only such liter- g ature as is in harmony with the Bible, and the Bible should be the final and only test.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark219"></a>Reconciliation</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">[Radiocast, from Station WBBR, New York, by .Tudste Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">rpHTS is the first of a series of lectures which -*• .1 hope to broadcast concerning the reconciliation of man to God. It is of first importance toman that he learn his proper relationship to his Creator. Few are they who know God. It is a duty laid upon every follower of Christ, to serve in the capacity of an ambassador to enlighten man concerning God's purpose and plan of reconciliation of man to Himself. The Apostle Paul wrote: “Now then,we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God.”—2 Corinthians 5: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The message of God’s Word has to do with man and his-experiences from his primacy to the present time. This is the appropriate time to gain a knowledge of the facts. A sharp contrast is drawn between the perfect and the imperfect man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">, A mighty prince, clothed witlugreat power and-authority and having, received, a dominion over which to rule, with light heart and buoyant, step walked in the way of happiness. His countenance was pleasing to the eye, his face radiated with smiles, and his-voice- musical and as dear as the trumpet sound on the. morning air. The beasts of the field and the fowls of the air obediently responded' ta his call. His food and raiment were supplied in abundance; and his castle, situated in the sweet-scented groves, was a place-of joy and delight.. His relationship with God was that of. confidence and trust. He was monarch of all he surveyed. But his happy situation was one of short duration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A man, apparently bent with years, journeyed through the valley of darkness. .His garments would..mark, him as a- tiller of the soil and. a feeder, of swine.. His.visage was greatly marred, telling, of thoughts, impure and.a heart wherein resided malice and ill .will. His voice was husky and cruel, and at his approach, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air fled before him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">&lt;■ The. mighty prince was the self-same one who-became the cruel and repulsive man. Shorn of his power and authority, and alienated from the mighty God. he no longer walked in the way of happiness. Now his journey lies along a ‘dreary and dismal way and leads to the bog of despair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Why the change from prince to pauper? His power and,authority, his dominion and his life, </span><span class="font13"></span></p>
<p><span class="font12">he tcceived from the Most High God. Because of disloyalty and unfaithfulness to his God and to the trust reposed in him he lost all. A wide gulf now separates him from his Creator and Benefactor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Is there hope of a reconciliation between the man and. the'Most High God?. Is it possible for the man ever to be restored to his dominion and to his place of honor and trust? These questions find answer in the sacred and holy Word of Jehovah. God. Therein, is disclosed the cause of the alienation of the mighty -prince, from Jehovah and the statement of God’s gracious provision leading to a way of reconciliation. The. Bible is God’s sacred Word of truth. From it and it alone is obtained the true history of the prince and the pauper. The story is more thrilling and fascinating than any fiction ever told.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The earth, was the beginning of this, drama and the home of the mighty prince. The earth is yet the place: of the domicile of man and all the offspring of the first man. Now after a lapse of more than.sixty centuries-comparatively few of his offspring understand who owns the. earth,, why it was created, and man’s relationship to the Creator. No man can have a proper appreciation of the history of the race, of his obligation to the Creator, and of the prospect set before him, if he ignores or turns aside from-the sacred truths contained in the Scriptures.- The Bible is the fountain of truth; and the more one drinks at this fountain, the sweeter is its lifeflowing stream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The earth incites the wonder and admiration of man even though he is imperfect and his understanding greatly limited. Whether, the earth is viewed with respect to the formation of its. various strata or its vegetable and animallife; whether by the use of the microscope its endless varieties are seen; or whether by employing the; telescope the relationship of.the earth to the other planets and the stars is considered, the reverential man stands in awe; and; wonderment at the wisdom displayed in its creation. And when he learns that the earth was created by the Most High God and made to be Ihe lasting habitation of man his mind and his heart yearn to know more about it and more concerning its great Creator. The telescope was not invented until 1608 A. D.<sub>?</sub> and .it is no matter of surprise that prior to that time man thought the earth to be the center of all things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The knowledge of the great Creator, as He reveals Himself in His creation of man and His provision for man, was preserved by a very few. This knowledge was merely a tiny stream of truth which trickled down through the centuries, and few were they that drank thereat. Early in the history of man he put God out of his thoughts; consequently the vision of man was limited to things he saw with his natural eye. When the sun and the moon and the stars came into view some men gave consideration to the creation but not to the Creator. Because it was apparent to them that all life enjoyed by all creation of earth proceeded from the sun, that planet became the object of worship by men. Those who did retain a knowledge of the Creator and had faith in Him knew that God was beyond the starry heavens, and they worshiped Him as the Creator<sup>-</sup> of both heaven and earth. Such were so few, however, compared with the greater number, that they are hardly observable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The development of the telescope, together with increased knowledge of things, brought men to see that the earth is not what man once had thought it to be. He learned that, instead of being fixed and the center of all things, the earth is a sphere and one among the other planets associated with the sun, and that the sun is the center of this planetary system known as the solar system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Increased knowledge, commonly known as physical science, discloses that there are stars so enormous that the earth beside these is but a pigmy. Astronomers claim that Betelguese is so large that the sun and its satellites, including the earth, could be placed in the interior of Betelguese’s shell and still keep their respective distances from each other. It is difficult for man to conceive the enormity of this tremendous star or planet. The enlightened student of the Word of God knows, however, that the earth holds a place of importance in God’s creation far greater than that of Betelguese or any other star save alone the one which is the place of the throne of the Eternal God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is claimed by savants that the writers of the Old Testament or Hebrew Scriptures wore ignorant of the relationship between the earth and the other stars and planets of creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There is no evidence, however, to support such a claim. It is quite evident that it was not the purpose of God to state in His Word, which constitutes our Bible, all the facts relative to the earth and its relationship to other bodies of creation. The spirit of God operated upon the minds of the faithful men of old who wrote the Bible and it is reasonable that they understood some things about the creation that are not recorded in the Scriptures. What they did write under divine direction &quot;was and is true, and of that we can be absolutely certain. These holy men of old wrote as they were moved upon by the holy spirit.—2 Samuel 23: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Bible is the only credible guide either as to the real relationship between man and the earth and the great Creator of both or concerning the purpose of the creation of both. Taking the Bible as his guide man sees that the earth occupies a place of great importance in God’s plan and purposes and that in His due time every creature in heaven and in earth will be brought into harmony and into one grand harmonious whole or unity. To this effect the inspired witness of Jehovah wrote: “Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: that in the dispensation of the fulness of times, he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him.” —Ephesians 1:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The constellation of the seven stars forming the Pleiades appears to be the crowning center around which the known systems of the planets revolve even as our sun’s planets obey the sun and travel in their respective orbits. It has been suggested, and with much weight, that one of the stars of that group is the dwelling-place of Jehovah and the place of the highest heavens. It is the place to which the inspired writer referred when he said: “Hear thou from thy dwellingplace, even from heaven” (2 Chronicles 6: 21) ; and that it is the place to which Job referred when under inspiration he wrote: “Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?”—Job 38:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The constellation of the Pleiades is a small one in size compared with others which scientific instruments disclose to the wondering eyes of man. But the greatness of other planets is small when compared with the Pleiades in importance, because the Pleiades is the place of the eternal throne of God. For a like reason the great groups of stars, greater in size than the planet earth, must in the eyes of Jehovah he of far less importance than the earth because of the close relationship between the earth and tint throne of Jehovah. Concerning this relationship the prophet of God wrote: “The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool.&quot; (Isaiah 66:1)' Thus it is shown from His Word that there is a direct and intimate relationship between the throne of Jehovah and the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The creation of the earth did not happen by chance, nor did the earth come into existence by the operation of blind force, as self-constituted savants and wise men claim. Its formation was by the will of God and it was created 'directly under His supervision. (Isaiah 42:5) “For every house is budded by some man; but he that built all things is God.” (Hebrews 3:4) Future ages may witness these other planets of greater size giving glory to the Creator beyond anything that is now revealed to us, but man can not now conceive of any of them ever being more highly honored than the earth. When man comes to appreciate this fact he will more fully appreciate how he has been favored by the great Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">That which lifts the earth into a position of importance beyond anything possible with the other planets is the fact that upon the earth has been staged the great drama of creation and here has been given the lessons of good and evil apparently intended for all time and for all the intelligent creatures of Jehovah. It must also be kept in mind that the Logos, the glorious Son of God and the active agent in the creation of all things, at the will of Jehovah left the courts of heaven and came to earth and while on the earth was subjected to the severest testings; that He here proved the perfect man’s proper relationship to Jehovah; that He suffered an ignominious death and was raised out of death and then exalted to the highest place in heaven next to Jehovah. All this was done in order that God, in His due time, might establish His will amongst His creatures on earth and in heaven, and all to the everlasting good of the peoples of earth and to the glory of Jehovah,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The exaltation of Jesus was higher than all others of God’s creation, and none other will ever ho so high, aside from Jehovah. That exaltation was not because of something Jesus had developed within Himself:. It was not because He had developed a character separate and distinct from Himself; nor was it because of what He had done before He camo to earth; but it was because of His fidelity, as a man while on the earth, to Jehovah in the faithful performance of His covenant and His duties and obligations laid upon Him by His Father. The. earth, was made the place where Jesus gained His victory through faith, and the earth was honored above all the other places by reason of what Jesus did upon it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Because God used the earth and man for His eternal purposes, and because 'His beloved Son Jesus when a man upon the earth proved His fidelity to God before men and angels, the conclusion must that the earth is the most favored, and will remain the most favored, in the planetary creation of God and will always be dear to the heart of the Creator. The man who traverses the earth now does not have a proper appreciation of the favors that have been bestowed upon him at the hands of the Creator, but in God’s due time he will come to a proper appreciation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">God made the earth suitable for animal life that is found upon it. The animal creation eats and drinks and enjoys existence and in due time perishes. Man is more than merely an animal to exist and propagate his species. His mind gives him capacity to search out the great truths in God’s arrangement and ibis litis him far above the other animal creation. His mind needs food and his gracious Creator has abundantly provided all his ways with food for both body and mind. Some men now have a sufficient, knowledge of things to prove that man may make an endless search into the wonders of the earth, and other great creative works of Jehovah which are related thereto, and that making this search his worshipful adoration toward the Creator will increase. In these marvelous works of creation God displays His wisdom, justice, love and power. When man begins to learn thereof he is filled with wonder, admiration, awe and reverence for the Master Workman. He needs to come to this attitude before he begins to learn wisdom. In fact wisdom is the application of knowledge according to the divine standard; therefore man must know of God and know God, at least to a degree, before he can become in any measure wise. .With profound respect and reverence, mingled with fear and trembling, man pursues his way in seeking knowledge of the Almighty. As his appreciation of his knowledge of God increases, his affection for Jehovah increases. Then he delights to know more of God’s works, and his pleasure leads him to seek them out. One of the holy prophets of Jehovah, musing upon the wonders of creation, exclaimed: “The works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.”—Psalm 111: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Bible is God’s Word expressed and revealed to His creature, man. The general thought amongst men is that the Bible is a confused mass of thoughts expressed. This erroneous conception is due to men who havemisrep-resented God and His Word. The Bible shows the clear statement of God’s purposes concerning the earth, and man once made its prince. Its opening chapters show that it was intended for man's instruction. It discloses that God intended man to he the monarch of the earth as long as he would remain in full harmony with his Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">God endowed the perfect man with the faculties of reason and .justice, wisdom, love and power, and gave him the freedom to use his will. In these respects man was made in the image and likeness of his Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Jehovah created the earth, and therefore it is His by right of creation. He set in operation His laws, intended by Him to produce results, and results followed in harmony with His will. The heavens and the earth were made by the expressed will of God. “By the word of the Lord were the heavens made: and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.”—Psalm 33:6, 9.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark220"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark221"></a>Man’s Dominion</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19280725_files/g_E_19280725-20.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">0 HAVE dominion, means to reign or rule over. God intended from the creation of the earth that perfect man should have dominion over the earth and its creatures. A prince means a governor or ruler who holds sway by authority. The perfect man Adam was made a prince or ruler of the earth. One clothed with authority is always subject to the one conferring that authority and must conform to the terms and conditions upon which the authority is conferred. JJl power and authority will by final analysis be found to reside in Jehovah. All power and authority rightfully exercised must be exercised in harmony with His will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Jehovah expressed His purpose of creating man. Addressing Himself undoubtedly to the Logos, His faithful and active agent in the creation of all things,- He said: “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.”—Gen. 1: 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The power of Jehovah knows no limitation. For Him to will a thing to be created means that it is certain to be done according to His will. Having determined to make man in His own image and likeness He proceeded so to do. It being His will that man should be a prince and have dominion over the things of the earth, this was done. That man was created for the earth and that the earth was created for man there is not the slightest room for doubt. Upon this point God’s will is expressed: “For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited; I am the .Lord, and there is none else. I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.”—Isaiah 45:18,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Since the dominion of all things resides in Jehova.li He could give it to whomsoever He might will. It is written : “The earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.” (Psalm 24:1) “The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord’s: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.” —Psalm 115:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Man, as well as the earth, belongs to Jehovah, because God created man. The authority of man tTo have dominion over the earth having been conferred upon man by Jehovah, man must exercise that authority and dominion in harmony with God’s will. When Adam was granted dominion and made a prince in the earth the duty and obligation devolved upon him to exercise that authority in harmony with his Creator. Adam was placed in Eden as its caretaker. He ■was not required to put forth laborious efforts to produce his food. Eden yielded freely all the food that was essential for his sustenance and for his pleasure. He was given control over the animals, the fowls and the fish, and these were to render and did render obedience to him. He was clothed with power and authority io produce bis own kind: and had ho exercised that God-given authority in harmony with his Creator he would have produced a perfect and happy family of children. God gave him the privilege to exercise bis own faculties. He could will to obey or to disobey. This, however, did not at all relieve him from the obligation of being in harmony with Jehovah and exercising his authority in harmony with God’s holy will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Eden was a large district, larger than is . generally supposed. It must have embraced </span><span class="font14">a </span><span class="font12">considerable area of land. Four rivers floAved out from the garden and watered the land round about. Eden not- only had beautiful groves which pleased the eye and produced food, but therein were to be found all the precious stones and much fine gold. The garden portion of Eden was on the eastern side and the entrance was from the east. It was more beautiful than the other part of the district. It was in that garden that man was placed as the caretaker and where he found his pleasure and his employment. The earth was for man and the perfect prince was placed in a perfect home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The ecclesiastical teachers misrepresenting God and His Word have led the people to believe that- had Prince Adam remained a good and faithful officer of Jehovah God in due time God would have taken him to heaven. There is absolutely no evidence upon which to base such </span><span class="font14">a </span><span class="font12">conclusion. Adam had no promise of heaven;, and there never was a possibility, under any circumstances or conditions, of his going to heaven. He was strictly and purely of the earth; and the earth alone was to be his everlasting home. Concerning this it is written: “The first man was of the earth, earthy.” (1 Corinthians </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">j</span><span class="font12"> 5</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">:47</span><span class="font12">1 Since the earth was made for the home of man we should not expect to find any promise of heaven for him, and there is not a word found in the Scriptures whereby Adam was promised heaven as a home. A proper understanding of this matter here will enable the student to have a clear understanding of what shall be the final destiny of the human family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The dominion of earth was never absolutely and irrevocably given to Adam. Had that been done God could not have taken it away from him even though lie disobeyed. Nor was Adam given life without some limitations. Upon this W the'•ecclesiastical'teachers have misrep-roented God and His Word and led the people illllOlBiB</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">elusive that life and dominion were conferred upon Adam to be held and enjoyed by him for ever upon condition that Adam render obedience to the great Giver. It would be inconsistent for God to give His creature life and dominion with no conditions or limitations added. In the event His creature, possessing life and dominion, should become a rebel his rebellion would continue for ever if his life were to continue for ever. The clergy, yielding to the seductive influence of Satan, have fallen into this great error. They have proceeded upon the theory that God granted Adam endless life, and that Adam, haring become a rebel, must spend his eternity in torment, being alienated from God. But the Scriptures do not at all support such a conclusion. On the contrary, the Scriptures shew that God gave man life and made him a prince in the earth upon the expressed condition that man be obedient to God. Should man never be disobedent and always remain in harmony Avith his Creator he would for ever enjoy life and dominion over the earth. But in the event he should become a rebellious creature, then the condition attached Avas: “Dying thou shalt die.” With the coming of death all things would be lost. Death therefore would conclusively prove that man’s dominion and his life Avere held conditionally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There is no thought expressed in the creation of man, and dominion granted to him, that he should ever go to torment. There is no thought expressed in the Bible anyAvhere that God purposes to put any of His creatures in a place of endless torture. On the contrary, the declaration of His laAV is plain and simple, and means that life and dominion Avere granted to Adam upon condition that he obey and that disobedience would mean the loss of his princely authority and his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Adam, as the prince of the earth, resided' in Eden. Adam was perfect and his home was perfect. It will not do to say that he was only partially perfect, and that he had at that time no opportunity to develop a character, and therefore his character was imperfect. It is written: “All the works of Jehovah are perfect.” (Deuteronomy 32:4) It was impossible for Adam to develop a character, because God made him a character. Every creature of intelligence is a character. He does not possess a character. Orthodox teachers fell into the great error of teadung that man has a soul;. whereas the Scriptures clearly teach that roan is a soul. They also fell into a like error by teaching that man has a character; whereas the Scriptures teach that man is a character. If Adam had to develop a character, then he was not perfect when he was put to the test; whereas the Scriptures declare he was perfect. He was endowed v.with the faculties of justice, wisdom, love and poAver. That did not mean that he possessed all knowledge. The Scriptures show that the highest of God’s creation will continue to acquire knowledge in all the ages to come. (Psalm 27: 4) Adam had sufficient knowledge, however, to know what to do and what not to do. He knew what was -wrong and what was right because God told him. He possessed the faculty of applying knowledge according to God’s instructions, and had he so applied it he would have proven his wisdom. He was clothed with power and this he exercised over the animal creation and he should have exercised it over Eve in the right way. He had the ability to be unselfish, which is love expressed, and had he chosen to exercise it properly he would have proven his love. He was perfect, in his organism. He had all his faculties about him. He was therefore a perfect man. It is true that Adam had not then had much experience, but experience is not the only way of acquiring knowd-edge. God told him what he might do and what he might not do, and that should have been sufficient. The experience through which he did thereafter pass only confirmed what God had previously told him. No excuse can therefore be offered for Adam because of his lack of experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Adam, with understanding clear, and being perfect, beheld the earth and said: ‘This is mine because Jehovah has given me dominion over it.’ Im summoned before him the animals and the birds, and named them and said: ‘These are mine because Jehovah gave dominion over them to me.’ At his call they obeyed his voice. He saw his beautiful wife and said: ‘This lovable creature Is mime because God made her and gave her tn he my companion and helpmeet.’ lie walked amidst the beautiful groves and scented the sweet blossoms, and ate the fruits, and said: ‘These arc all mine because my God provided them for me: hut He has asked me to not eat of the fruit of that one tree and 1ms told me that death shall result if I eat.’ He would say ; ‘AU these things are mine upon condition that I obey my Creator and if I disobey I will lose all of them.’ This must have been his conclusion because it is written: ‘‘Adam was not deceived.” (1 Timothy 2:14) This is proof that Adam was in possession of all his God-given faculties, which faculties were perfect. ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Prince Adam was rich because all the gold and the precious stones were his, and all the cattle and the flocks were his because he was the man and the trusted representative of Jehovah and to him all of these things had been committed. He was strong and vigorous and knew no such thing as pain. He was happy because his environment was happy and everything about him was at ease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One may possess all the means of doing good, but if he does not employ those means to that end he does not accomplish good. Adam was endowed with the faculties of wisdom, justice, love and power, and these he must use as he might choose. It was the will of God that he should do right, but God permitted Adam to exercise his own will as to whether he would do right or wrong. That which is exercised in opposition to love is selfishness. Pride is the fruit of selfishness. “Pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.” God made no law compelling Adam to exercise the faculty of love toward Him, but He endowed Adam with that faculty and then told him what would be the result if he followed a selfish course... Jehovah has announced His rule of action, to wit, that he who loves God will keep God’s commandments. (John 14:15) Love is therefore the fulfilment of God’s law. God commends His love to His creatures in that everything He does for His creatures He does unselfishly. He afforded the opportunity for His perfect and intelligent creature to be like Him. One must know God and follow a like course to for ever remain in harmony with Him. Adam did know<sup>T</sup> God. because God communicated with him and Adam did have the opportunity to remain in harmony with God. Another irrevocable ride of action of Jehovah, and which is announced in His Word, is, that to know God and to be like Him means to enjoy endless life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The mighty prince that started upon his way of peace, perfection, beauty and happiness, surrounded by every inducement to walk in harmony with God, might have enjoyed these blessed Unrigs for ever. He became a pauper, and his offspring have continued to suffer.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark222"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark223"></a>The Children’s Own Radio Story </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">By C.</span><span class="font13"> J. JF., 'Jr.</span></h6>
<p><span class="font12">Story Nine</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">THE most recent of our radio stories was  about the wonderful adventure of the young boy Jesus, in the temple at Jerusalem. You no doubt remember that He stood before the wise and learned men who were gathered in the temple and asked them many questions so deep that none could answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Then, when Joseph and Mary came to seek Jesus, and found the young boy in the temple, in ••answer to their question He said, “Wist ye not that I must be about my Father’s business?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We step forward with the Bible account, which says little about the life of Jesus from the time of the adventure in the temple until Jesus was about thirty years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Of that period, about eighteen years, the Bible says: “And he went down with them [Joseph and Mary], and came to Nazareth, and. was subject unto them. . . . And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with and man.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">‘Do you notice that little remark which Jesus was </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">subject</span><span class="font12"> unto Joseph and Mary? ness] till the' day of his shewing unto Israel.”</span></p>
<div>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font12">says</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Now</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font12">what do you suppose that means ? It means that although Jesus was the Son of Jehovah God, and His mother and Joseph were human beings, still to them, until He was a man, He owed the same respect and obedience as you or I owe to our fathers and mothers. And we see from the account in God’s Word, that even though Jesus knew that He was the Son of Almighty God, He honored and obeyed His human relations, just as I hope you honor and obey your own father and mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">the time that Jesus lived with Joseph and Mary in Nazareth, young John, the son of Zacharias, who, you will remember, was about six months older than Jesus, was growing up in the wilderness. A wilderness is not a pleasant place to live in, for most people, but 1 dare say that John, being- specially favored of God, found it more pleasant than we could suppose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">However, John dwelt in the wilderness, as the Bible tells us: &quot;And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts [wilder-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">: • ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ ■' /■ - 1 : 703</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">As every thing that Jehovah God does is always exactly right and is always done at exactly the right time, we would of course expect to see John, the herald of Jesus, appear upon the scene just before Jesus Himself, as a man, began the great work which Jehovah entrusted to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This was the case. When Jesus had passed from boyhood to manhood, and was, according to the Jewish law, a full-grown man, that is, about thirty years of age, the voice of the Lord God came to John in the wilderness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Bible says that “the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness, and he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Of course, when this fine young man began to go about Palestine telling the people about the coming of Jesus, and baptizing them, the wise men in Jerusalem became very excited about it. These wise men were called Pharisees and Sadducees, and rvere mostly priests and doctors and lawyers. They wanted to hold the great power which they had over the people, and feared that the coming of John was the end of their wicked sway, for they had deceived and lied to the people and of course they did not want the people to know about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">So they sent some of their members to John, to ask him questions and to try to scare him. But John was sent by Jehovah God, and he was not frightened. The account in the Bible reads thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou? And he confessed, and denied not, but confessed, I am not the Christ. And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias ? And he saith, I am not. . . . Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? He said: I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord. , , . .He it is . . . whose shoe’s latchet I am not. worthy to unloose.”</span></p>
