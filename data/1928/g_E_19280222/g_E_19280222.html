<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Edinburgh’s Neu, Fire Alarms</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">THDINBCRG 11, Scotland, has a new system of JLJ fire alarms by which loud speakers enable firemen to converse with whoever sends in the alarm, even if he he located ten feet distant from the box at the time. The exact location of the fire is given by this means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Polish Severity Against Communists</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;DOLAND has sentenced 123 communists io J- a total of 1,000 years imprisonment in what are admitted, to be, at this time, the worst prisons in the world. Nine of these unfortunate men were sentenced for life. They are not accused of having committed any overt acts, but alleged to he preparing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">. New Process of Making Tool-Steel</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A FIRM in Sheffield, England, has perfected ,**• a new process of making tool-steel without fuel. The melting is done exclusively by high frequency electrical current, insuring freedom from sulphur and phosphorus, greater homogeneity of metal, more accurate control of the temperature and the privilege of intermitting operation with very little loss of efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Cost of the War</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">THE cost of the World War to the United States was $35,119,622,000; and the number of Americans that lost life because of it was 126,000. The question as to what America got for all this is still being discussed. It was the W to end war; but armaments are now increasing more rapidly than ever before in the history of the world, and there are more men Sender arms. But we all know that the Morgan loans to France and Britain were taken care of; •o that is something, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Civilization in Argentina</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font9">HE League of Nations commission on the white slave traffic has declared Argentina, Brazil and Egypt as the chief importers of white slaves, and that one of the theatres in Buenos Aires admits fipm 100 to 200 women free each night so that they may solicit patrons. They must have a nice religion in the Argentine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Dictatorships in Europe &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">THE New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font9"> prints an interesting J- list of dictatorships in Europe, ranging all the way from the one in Russia which Uncle Sam refuses to recognize to the one in Italy which he financed. The list includes the countries of Spain, Bulgaria, Poland, Portugal, Yugoslavia, Turkey, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania and Albania, and three-fifths of the population of Europe. i • &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;&lt;•■■■•■</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Britain Feels the Pinch</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-variant:small-caps;">S</span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ib Geobgjs Newman, chief medical officer of the British Board of Education, declares that one million British children are unfit to study, because suffering from malnutrition. Frank Simonds, noted press correspondent, says that the British people are sick unto death of war and have no interest in nor desire for any naval competition with the United States, nor for anything but peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Spiritualism and Christianity</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">G</span><span class="font9">LANCING through the columns of an atheist paper we notice that a certain Reverend, the pastor of a so-called Spiritualist church, is a contributor. He bluntly writes, <sup>£</sup>T am opposed to the Christian humbug, and I don’t believe in a personal God.” Anyway, we know what this Reverend really does stand for, and his very honesty in his unbelief entitles him to a measure of respect</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Child Pats a Leopard</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font9"> LEOPARD escaped from an animal store i</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">n</span><span class="font9"> London. Before its anxious owners could locate it, the animal found its way into a back yard where a two-year-old child was playing. The child had never seen such a large kitten but bravely patted it on the back; and although the kitten snarled, the child escaped any harm, and the owners got their leopard back into its cage without accident.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">A Cute Picture</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font9">S CUTE a picture as you would wish to seo is that of twelve Russian children loaded in an open-air truck on their way to a suburb of Moscow where they installed home-made nests for the starlings. These young pioneers bore with them placards reading, in Russian, &quot;Take Care of Birds” and “Birds Are Our Friends”. They all look exceedingly happy and well fed. The picture appears in the .magazine </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Our Dumb Animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">German Secrets in the World War</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">H</span><span class="font9">OW hard it is to keep secrets in these days</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">is proven by what happened to German cipher messages during the World War. The British government read every one of these cipher messages; and though the keys were changed every few hours, yet it never took more than two or three hours to determine the change which had been made. The British government knew in advance, by this means, every important move of the German navy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">HemphilTs Protest to President Coolidge</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-variant:small-caps;">J</span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ohn S. Hemphiix, Ferguson, Mo., whose son was killed in the war in Nicaragua, has written President Coolidge, “For the death of my ■ son, I hold no malice or ill will toward General</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Sandino or any of his men; for I think (and I believe ninety percent of our own people agree with me) that they are today fighting for their liberty, as our forefathers fought for our liberty in 1776, and that we as a nation have no legal or moral right to be murdering those liberty-loving people in a war of aggression.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Soviet Peace Proposals</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font9">HE Soviet peace proposals to the League of Nations involved the destruction of all weapons, military supplies, warships and military air vessels; the abolition of military service, training and the calling of reserves; the destruction of fortresses, naval and air bases, military plants and factories; the discontinuance of funds for military purposes: the abolition of military, naval and air ministries, general staffs and all military administrations, departments and institutions; ths prohibition of military propaganda and instruction; the prohibition of patenting of all war devices; and legislation making infringement of any of these stipulations a crime against the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Palestine Said to Se Overtaxed</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-variant:small-caps;">J</span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">acob De Haas, prominent editor and Zionist,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">in a speech in Brookline, Massachusetts, claims that Britain is overtaxing the Jews in Palestine, producing a surplus at the expense ■' of the Jewish people there and hampering the development of the country. Especially he regrets the award of the Dead Sea to Britons, claiming that while it will create vast wealth elsewhere it will reduce Palestine itself to a land of beggary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Jews Now Expect Their Messiah</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">O</span><span class="font9">F THE 150,000 Jews in Palestine it is said</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">that at least 50,000 expect their Messiah, ■ and are praying daily for his coming. They declare that the Messiah will be a superman and that his kingdom will be a great center from which will radiate peace and brotherhood extending throughout the entire world. It is <sup>: </sup>their expectation that the Messiah, who will ; become king of the Jewish nation, will personally put an end to the next world war at the moment when all appears lost. Bible Students, familiar with the prophecies, greatly appreciate these good hopes of the Jewish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A Poser </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">for the Padre</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">O</span><span class="font9">NE of the highway contractors in. Pennsyl</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">vania is an Italian and he employs laborers I of many nationalities. Some of his men were digging a deep ditch on a raw, windy day, under the direction of a pushing Italian foreman. Among them were two Irishmen. The parish priest came along, saw them in the ditch and ■ leaning over said, laughingly:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“I never thought to see Irishmen working for. ■ a dago boss.” Michael straightened up, spat on his hands and replied:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Well yir rivirince, how about yersilff”</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">E</span><span class="font9">VERY day adds more evidence showing how Charles E. Carpenter, president of The badly the Hearst papers were fooled in pub- Houghton Line, tells us in his house organ</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">‘ listing the supposed Mexican documents which all experts, including Hearst’s own experts, declare are forgeries. Moreover, the documents contain several hundred instances of misplaced accents and misspelled words. The man who wrote up the stories for the Hearst papers testifies to having had four interviews with a newspaper man in Mexico City on one matter connected with these documents and yet testifies on oath that he does not remember who it was. No public carriers between Mexico and the United States have any record of having carried or having seen the bogus documents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Fruit Plentiful in California</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">N</span><span class="font9">EW lemons are selling in Southern California now at 5 cents per dozen at fruit-stands along the highways. Whole orchards of lemon trees are being dug up or cut down and burned; fruit and all, because it does not pay to hire help to pick the fruit. The fruit boxes are worth than the fruit. A person can get all the 'fruit he wants to haul away for the picking of it in the lemon fields. “Oranges are selling at the roadside fruit-stands at 20 cents per 10-quart . pail. We are throwing them at the trees and batting them with ball-bats. In the best of them we punch a hole and suck out some of the juice. Melons rot in the fields. Heavy frosts are hurting the orange growers,” writes a correspondent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Jerome’s Interesting Prediction</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">FTIHE death of Jerome K. Jerome, English -*■ writer, and lover of peace, recalls his interesting words, written in 1916, when the World War was at its height. Most of- the things he mentioned have come to pass:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There may be one color for Poland instead of three. Alsace and Lorraine will have returned to France, and that one last corner still soiled by Turkish rule may, one hopes, have been cleaned out. The main features will remain. Germany, bruised and battered, her arrogance and her bombast knocked out of her, but still alive and vigorous, will set to work to build herself anew. Ten years after peace is signed—every schoolboy knows it— we shall be buying from Germany, selling to Germany. In twenty years we shall be playing tennis with them</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">and teaching them golf.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font7">And thirty years later it is .. with two satellites, going for the unfortunate heretic,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">quite possible that they, in turn, may be our allies. </span><span class="font9">something that ought to warm the heart of every true American, and ought to soak into the preachers, the newspapers, the politicians, the Ku Klux Klan and the American Legion. He says, and it is a gem:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Chinese arc not supposed to be civilized, and they don’t know what they are lighting for ; but they at least know enough not to believe that they are fighting to make democracy safe for civil izafjon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Here are two more from the same pen:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If you want our opinion of jazz, here it is: We believe jazz to be vulgar; blatant; hideous; degrading; demoralizing; an insult to music; a nerve irritant and a crime, from which we suppose you will gather that there is. something about jazz which we do not exactly like.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Just because a few bossy, so-called strong-minded women want to deteriorate to the level of men and swear, smoke, drink, and dissipate generally and enter into politics and neglect the home duties which God according to Genesis created them for, is no reason why all of our women should be degenerated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Common Prison of the Inquisition</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">W</span><span class="font9">ITHIN the past few months seventeen paintings, each four feet by nine, portraying the horrors of the Spanish Inquisition, have been on exhibition at 1670 Broadway, New York. From the description of one of the pictures we print the following, which will assist some minds to get a proper view of the Holy Roman Catholic Church, a representative of which many Protestants are so anxious to see in the American presidential chair:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The dungeons of the Inquisition consisted in subterranean vaults, situated at a depth of more than thirty feet underground. A vessel intended to satisfy the natural wants, and which was emptied only once every week or every fortnight, occupied one of the corners and completed to infect the air which was already to a great extent disoxygenated by the breathing of the unfortunate sufferer condemned to sojourn in these dreadful holes. Some of them, mad with despair, put an end to their torments by killing themselves. These wretched victims, to escape from the tortures, crushed their heads against the walls; others suffocated themselves by strongly inhaling the mephitic gas emitted by the vessels filled with excrements. The present picture represents a Dominican friar, attended by a torturer who is to appear before the Inquisitorial Court.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Development of the Gold Coast</span></h5>
<p><span class="font17">B</span><span class="font9">IIE G&lt;»kl Coast of Africa, from which the ancestors of the millions of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Negroes</span><span class="font9"> in the United States were largely taken, is now being developed rapidly. The old slave castles are no longer in use as-inslruments of oppression. A new port and a modern city are being built at Takoi*adi. One of its features is a million-dollar hospital entirely for the natives. Eighteen other hospitals have been opened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The natives, than whom there are no finer specimens of manhood anywhere, have remarkable memories. It is said that many of them, when they learn to read, can commit to memory their textbooks. Their only difficulty, as with many other people, is in making practical application of what they learn. But even here they are excelling and are building up under a better-than-usual British administration </span><span class="font10">a </span><span class="font9">high-class modern state.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Why I Am Not a Socialist </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By C. E. Guiver (London)</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">O</span><span class="font9">N MORE than one occasion I have been charged with being a socialist, and it has even been suggested that had it not been for the truth, I should have been standing at street corners and in public parks fighting the lions of capital, oligarchy, plutocracy and monopoly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This view of my views is not because I have ever worn a red tie, or waved a red flag, or sung the socialist’s anthem, or because I have used such terms as capitalist, proletariat, individualism and collectivism; or have decried the competitive system and extolled the virtues of the cooperative system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is not because I have a loud voice, or a large vocabulary, or can rattle off a number of fine-sounding phrases, which may mean a great deal if one could understand them. It is not because I talk about the sins and ignorance of the government and the rights and intelligence of the people. Oh, no! But it is because I have at times, few and far between, expressed a few homely truths on equality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Equality is a wonderful thing to talk about, especially if you happen to be with those who are better than yourself, but not so wonderful </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">. von regard as in-</span><span class="font9">upon the lucky jam-eating few, and, if they cannot get it for themselves, to spoil it for the others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Socialism has for its principle that what affects the community should be owned by the community, and that what affects the individual only should he owned by the individual. For example: Cemeteries, gas-factories, mines, railways and other necessary evils afflict the community, and should be owned or abolished by the community; whereas skirts, tooth-brushes, bril-liantine and powder-puffs affect the individual. (I was going to say only, but that is not always true, especially the puff, at least the powder on the puff, for it sometimes affects another individual when osculatory exercises are performed; in any case these, the articles, not the osculations, should be owned by the individual.) The question is not whether we should have individualism or collectivism, but how much of the one and how little of the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Land is one of the things that the community should control, says the socialist. Some say it because they have none, except in a flower-pot; and most of us will not get any until our end,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">society with new bits of cloth until it becomes a new suit, as though, the ideal state will grow naturally out of the present disorder; others think we should scrap, the old clothes and get new ones, but they do not say whether or not the state must go naked until the new are found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I am not a socialist because: (1) Selfishness is innate in man, and selfishness is the one thing which would make the most ideal system a failure and, to go upon the lines that some suggest, is like building the walls of the city with dynamite for cement, winch at the least percussion explodes.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">(2) Even if socialism succeeded to a degree, it is only half a remedy, and becomes a mule with a horse’s head and a donkey’s body running about. It has some intelligence, buf its hind part kicks and causes trouble. ■</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">(3) All socialists see the need of.reform; </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font9">not all agree as to the method by which it should be brought about, and are thus opposing each other: reminding one of a crowd of school boys pulling a cartload of apples for their fellows. Some pull it this way, and some pull it that; </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">and, </span><span class="font9">eating the apples as they go, the cart is empty long before they reach their destination.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">Equality, fraternity and liberty are fine - words. All for each and each for all, sounds well; communal ownership of communal interests is a good principle. Well, it may be all right; but I know something better, and that’s why I am not a socialist.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark13"></a>The Misuse of the Radio </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By C. J. W., Jr.</span></h5>
<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font9"> HAVE just been, listening to the hookup of stations engaged in broadcasting the proceedings of the annual banquet of radio manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers. The first hour was devoted to speeches, mostly ungrammatical, awkward and delivered with the customary bleat of the man trying to make an impression and ignorant of how to go about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Eor the most part the speakers were evidently doddering, mercenary, unintellectual wretches to whom lockjaw on that occasion ■Would have been a mercy, both for their hearers and for their own reputations as speakers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The speaking was bad enough; but it was followed by one of these so-called “popular” orchestras, hammering, squawking and scraping out the cacophony of “popular” tunes. And what tunes 1 But as all have heard these cheap tin-pan bands, operated by mechanics, and not overly good mechanics at that, with little or no sense of time, rhythm, harmony, tune or tone-color, I spare all further reference to them. ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Then, amid thunderous applause, the announcer introduced a “humorist”. Now if there is any object more completely doleful and wretched than any other it is a humorist at a function, trying desperately hard to be&quot; funny. There was half an hour of rusty, musty, feeble jokes; and then in despair I turned the radio nff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After more than half an hour I returned. Werrenrath, the golden-voiced tenor, is on the air, trying his best to erase the memory of the evening’s miserable beginning, and is doing it well. Why can we* not have first-class music and first-class speeches over all the radios all the time? Is it true that the American people find their chief delight in listening to matter which would hardly be acceptable to ten-year-old children ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Sad as it is, it must be that it is the people themselves that are responsible for this misuse of the radio, inane jokes, unintellectual speakers with nothing to say, who say it loudly, and make music which is a horror to the ears. Let the people cry down these monstrosities that are making the night hideous, and demand .artistic execution of high-class music and talks by lecturers who have something to say and know how to say it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Devil, is doing all in his power at 'thir time to make the radio a thing to be loathed instead of a thing wherewith men might be lifted to the skies. I am glad that the Bible Students are becoming more and more skilled in radio coimnunication. I know that they can he depended on to give the public only that which is good, ennobling and satisfying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I could wish that all of the radio stations were up to the high standard of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">WBBR, WORD* </span><span class="font9">WHK, CKCX, etc.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark15"></a>A Diminutive Sharpshooter</span></h5>
<p><span class="font17">B</span><span class="font9">OYS do not mind being squeezed sidewise, but they do object to being squeezed up and down. But if Leon Charles Smoker, grandson of William Kimmel, could be squeezed down just half an inch (and that ought not to hurt so much) he would be just four feet tall. That is one foot taller than the door knob, and six inches shorter than the mantelpiece.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Leon was born January 17, six years ago. He has brown eyes, weighs 48 lbs. (which is the same as a sack of flour), is quiet and gentlemanly, and has a sweet smile. Shall we say that he is sweet? Boys are not supposed to be sweet; and until one. came our way we never knew that they were; but they really are. That is a big joke on the fathers. They never knew that boys are sweet until they had one of their own. They knew that the girls are. Everybody knows that. But nobody suspected that the boys are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Well, Leon heard his father and mother talking about the service work, and used to go out last summer and sit in the car and watch the work going on. Then his mother, being indisposed for some weeks, was unable to get out; and it rather worried Leon. He felt as if he ought to do the manly thing and take her place until she could go on with the work Leon believes in man’s rights as well as woman’s rights, the right to be manly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Several times he broached the matter to his father, who thought him a little under size and under </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">age</span><span class="font9"> for such important work. Finally the father consented, but suggested that his son go witlrhim while he made the canvasses, or at any rate go in every other house, so as to keep track of him. But Leon looked up in his face and said: “No, papa; you go on the other side of the street, and let me work this side.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We learn that Leon’s canvass is as follows: “Good morning! Have you heard of Judge Rutherford, who talks over the radio from WBBR, the Watchtower station, in New York! Here are some of his books. This one, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort for the People,</span><span class="font9"> has all these questions answered: Why is the Outlook for the World so Dark? Why are so many Clergymen and their Parishioners Scoffers? Why are the Nations </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">SO DANGEROUSLY </span><span class="font9">Preparing for War? Can the World be Stabilized? Why the Agitation Among the Jews Concerning the Reestablishment of Palestine? What is Meant by the Kingdom of Heaven? and What Blessings may the People Expect to Come from it? This one, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Where are the Dead?</span><span class="font9"> shows where our loved ones are and when they will come back to us. It is the most comforting one of all. The last one is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom for the Peoples,</span><span class="font9"> and has a very good message for everybody. You get all three of these . for 25c; or </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort for the People</span><span class="font9"> is 10c, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Where are the Dead</span><span class="font9"> 10c, and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom for the'Peoples</span><span class="font9"> is 5c.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Asked, “Leon, what do you do if they do not buy? Do you get mad?” He replied: “Oli, -no! I just go on to the next house.” If they buy he thanks them and says: “I hope you will read it and enjoy it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The first time Leon canvassed was Sunday, October 30, approximately three hours: sales, twenty-five booklets. His second attempt was Sunday, November 20, a cold day. He canvassed two hours and sold seventeen booklets.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In answer to a request, Leon’s father, from whom some of these details were obtained, wrote us:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The child was consecrated to the Lord before his birth; and since then divine help and guidance have been sought continually that he might be directed hi the right way. In our family worship he is continually reminded of the fact that his parents have consecrated him to the Lord, and that it is his desire that he may become a useful helper in the Lord’s kingdom, which is now here.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some Scriptures occur to us as appropiate at this point. Adults please take notice:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength, because of thine enemies; that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.” (Psalm 8:2) “And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to th.® son of David! they were sore displeased, and said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea: have y® never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?”.......Matthew 21 f</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark17"></a>The Establishment of the World</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">[Broadcast from Station WBBB, New York, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">O</span><span class="font9">N THE sixteenth of October over this station you will recall that I spoke to you concerning the great battle of God Almighty. That is otherwise designated in the Scriptures as Armageddon. It is now my privilege to speak concerning the establishment of the world. It is fitting that we here again define what is meant by the word “world”. It means the peoples of earth organized into forms of government un-'der the supe rvision of an invisible overlord. For centuries Satan has been the invisible overlord of the people of earth. The time must come when the Lord Jesus Christ ousts Satan from his position and then under the direction of Jehovah establishes a righteous government amongst men. We must believe this to be true if we believe the Bible. God’s prophet, looking down to the time when Christ would take His authority and establish righteousness, wrote: “Say among the nations, that the Lord reigneth: the -world also ■ shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.” —Psalm 96:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Let us briefly examine this prophecy. The time for the beginning of its fulfilment is stated to be when the Lord reigns or begins His reign. Other scriptures show that the Lord took His power and began positive action against Satan in 1914. You wall recall that this matter was considered in discussing “The Birth of The Nation”. The beginning of that time -was marked by the World War and other attending evidences. Immediately following the World W ar all Christians -who believe and appreciate the Bible discerned that now the words of Jesus spoken in. Matthew 24:14 must be fulfilled. These words are: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall the end come.” (Matthew 24:14) This is exactly in harmony with the aforementioned prophecy. One prophecy is that God commands His people to tell out the truth and to “say among the nations, that the Lord reigneth: the world also shall be established”. This is complete proof that it cannot be moved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I am not speaking on this matter to get adherence to the Bible Students, nor to get money away from the people, noi- for any other selfish reason. I am speaking because I love the Lord God and have agreed to obey Him; and I am trying to do so. Therefore it is my privilege and my duty to call attention to these matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One of the other commandments which God gave to those who have agreed to do His will, is that they must declare the day of God’s vengeance. That means that they must declare God’s purpose to vindicate His name. That is the reason&quot; for speaking concerning the battle of Armageddon. Nothing could be gained by frightening the people, but it is manifest that God intended for this matter to be called to the attention of the people for their good, That great climax in the affairs of men must precede the establishment of the world. Armageddon marks the expression of God’s indignation against the great wickedness that Satan has caused the people to fall into.. It is the will of God, as declared by His Word, that the people now should be advised of this that they may understand that Jehovah is God, and that Christ is His great Executive Officer. The great battle of Armageddon is yet future, and the Scriptures and other facts indicate it is near, and then the Scriptures positively show that the establishment of the world shall follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When a great earthquake, a disastrous storm, or a mighty tidal wave, sweeps a community and destroys houses and peoples by the thousands, and leaves other thousands homeless, much woe and distress follow; and great effort is required to relieve the suffering. The battle of Armageddon in the “great and terrible day of the Lord” will mark the complete collapse of Satan’s organization. What an earthquake or terrific storm or tidal wave is to a community that trouble will be to the whole world, only much worse. In the wake thereof there will be great woe and distress ; and the people will cry for relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It may truly be said that the history of the world has been written in human blood. But the worst is not yet. The long and terrible siege of Titus against Jerusalem brought to the Jews indescribable suffering, and the final assault upon the city by the Romans completely destroyed it. The destruction of Jerusalem was in fulfilment of divine prophecy, and foreshadowed what will befall the organizations of the -world in the great battle of God Almighty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The trouble that came upon Jerusalem was an expression of God’s indignation against the peo-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">pie, who had repudiated Him and followed after the Devil. The clergy of that day, posing as representatives of God and hypocritically claiming to be the interpreters of His law, were responsible for the terrible calamity that fell upon the city. The religionists of Christendom have turned the minds of the people away from God. Christendom’s trouble, therefore, will be more terrible than that which befell Jerusalem in 70-73 A. D. God has promised to make a complete end of the evil systems in the final trouble that shall befall Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We may call to mind all the disasters that have befallen the human race during its existence, all the wars, all the earthquakes, cyclones and other calamities; and then know that none of these will equal in woe that which shall befall the world during the great battle of Armageddon. That this conclusion is correct is proven by the words of Jesus that upon the earth there should be tribulation such as was not since the world began, no, and never should be again. But this great time of trouble will result ultimately in great blessing to the people. God has so ordained it</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After God’s righteous indignation has been completely expressed against Satan’s organization, the great stormy wind that will tear the mountains and rend the rocks will cease to blow; the quaking that shook the earth from center to circumference will quake no more; the heaven-enkindled fires, having quickly spent their fury, will cease to burn, and silence and rest will once more come to the earth. But the survivors of the people will be disheartened, discouraged and faint. In their distress and extremity they will call upon the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Then will come from heaven the still, small voice; and Use message long ago spoken by the prophet of God will gently speak words of encouragement to all the peoples of good will on earth/ saying: “0 worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth. Say among the nations that the Lord reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously. Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof. Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice before the Lord: for he cometh, for he Cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.”—Psalm 96: 9-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All divine prophecy has its fulfilment in due time, and can be understood only when fulfilled or in course of fulfilment. The foregoing prophecy has now begun to be fulfilled, in that those who are watching the development of God’s plan see that the Lord has taken His power, and begun His reign; therefore they know that shortly shall follow the complete fulfilment of the prophecy. Then will come a period of reconstruction and the Blessings of mankind, according to the promises God has made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The positive and unequivocal promise here made by the prophet is: “The world shall be established that it shall not be moved.” The “world” here means an organization for the benefit of man. World in Scriptural usage,, . means the peoples of earth, organized into for</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ms </span><span class="font9">of government, under the supervision and control of an invisible overlord. It consists of both, heaven and earth. Heaven means the invisible, while earth refers to the visible part of the world. For centuries the invisible part of the world has been Satan and his unholy angels, while the visible part has consisted of organized forms of government on earth, influenced and controlled by Satan. Looking down to the time: when Satan’s world shall perish, God through; His prophet says: “For behold, I create newt heavens, and a hew earth: and the former shall;,: not be remembered, nor come into mind.. But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create.” (Isaiah 65:17,18) This prophecy must have its fulfilment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In harmony with these words of the holy prophet, Peter in prophetic phrase describes the passing of the old heavens and earth. He says; “Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens, being on fire, shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with, fervent heat.” (2 Peter 3:12) Be it noted that these pass away in the day of God; that, is to say, in the time of God’s expressed wrath. Then Peter adds: “Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelk-th righteousness.” (2 Peter 3: .13) In view of these two di* vinely provided witnesses we may have full assurance that the new world will be established, and that it will be so completely established that it can never be moved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For many centuries Satan the enemy, as head, aided and abetted by his wicked angels, has constituted the heavens that have influenced and controlled the nations and peoples of earth. With the coming of Christ Jesus into power in 1914 Satan and his demon hosts have been east out of heaven onto the. earth. (Psalm 110:5; Revelation 12:9) The new heaven therefore is now an established fact. Christ is in control thereof. None of the people appreciate this fact except those who diligently seek to know God’s Word and to serve Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The next great manifestation of the Lord’s power will be the destruction of the beast and the false prophet, the visible or earthly part of the Devil’s organization. With the beast and the ■false prophet destroyed, and Satan bound, the whole earth (visible evil systems) ’will pass away. Then there will be no more restless elements of humanity, symbolically described as the elements shall follow the establishment of the new earth. With its establishment the world shall be .established, as, foretold by the Psalm 96:10 because' both - Aeaven ■ and earth will then be under the control of the. righteous King, the Prince of Peace and Lord of lords.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">John had a vision of the new world, and wrote: &quot;And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no .more sea. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband/’—Revelation</span><span class="font2">liRevelation</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The new heaven is the government of Messiah, the new nation born and in power. It is . the holy city, the new Jerusalem. It is the government of peace, with the Prince of Peace as its bead and ruler in charge; the government of* Messiah, which takes the place of that which has been long invisibly ruling the world. The new heaven, or invisible part of the new government, is beautiful and glorious; and is described by John, in symbolic phrase as being like unto a bride adorned for her husband. That is the time when a woman tries to appear at her best, and ,;’d°es so appear. This does not mean that the holy city, the now Jerusalem, has a husband. On</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">ment, composed of Christ Jesus and the glorified adorned for her husband” are merely words descriptive of the beauty and glory of the new government, the new nation born.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Since Satan the enemy, and his. angels, who compose the old heaven, are invisible, does that signify that the new heaven will also be invisible? Yes; the new heaven will be invisible. The chief one making up that new heaven is Christ Jesus. We have His own words as to whether/ or not He will ever again be seen by the peoples of earth, when He says: “Yet a little, while, and the world seeth me no more.” (John 14:19) Christ Jesus is the express image of Jehovah, and no human eye can see God. (Hebrew’s 1:3; 1 Timothy 6:16) Satan, a spirit being, has also been invisible to man and has exercised power and control over man. Even so the Lord Jesus the King of glory, though invisible to man, shall exercise power and control over men of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Since the time of Eden until the complete destruction of his organization Satan has had visible representatives on the earth. Does this suggest that the Prince of Peace, the great Messiah, will have visible representatives on earth ? He will, and the Scriptures definitely so state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Since God lias promised that He will create a new’ heaven and a new earth, and since the Apostle Peter says that in this now heaven and new earth “will dwell righteousness, we may be suro that the new visible organization of the Messianic government will be righteous; that is to say, Hie visible rcpreseidatives of the righteous King on earth will be in harmony will; and obedient to His command.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But after th.? destruction of Satan’s organization, and after the-binding of Satan, some men ; will survive; and of these there will be some more ambitious than others. Will not these ambitious and stronger ones push &lt;&nbsp;h p®selves forward and get into the government and control it and again bring about </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> eonditiwbf ’hhrigJtll eousness?

<div><img src="g_E_19280222_files/g_E_19280222-3.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">ONG ago God prepared certain men who under adverse conditions proved their loyalty and faithfulness to God; and then they died. These men received God's approval. They will be resurrected from the grave. They will be brought forth as perfect men, wholly devoted to the Lord, and will be the visible representatives of the Lord’s righteous kingdom on the earth. They will constitute the nucleus of the new earth. The scriptures hereinafter submitted conclusively prove these assertions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is a fixed rule of the divine plan that God grants everlasting life to no creature until that one is first fully tested and, under, the test, proves his loyalty and faithfulness. God gave Adam life; but He then put him to the test before He would grant him everlasting life. Under the test Adam fell. His failure was because he gave his allegiance to the enemy of God. He was both a disloyal and an unfaithful man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The next perfect man on earth was Jesus. Before the heavenly Father granted Jesus the great and high reward of eternal life on the divine plane He first put Him to the most severe tests; and all these tests Jesus met successfully, and thereby proved His loyalty and His faithfulness unto God.—Luke 4:1-14; Philippians 2: fill ; Hebrews 5: 8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At once the absurdity of the doctrine of inherent immortality of all men appears. Satan is the author of this false doctrine; and Satan’s representatives, the clergy, have proclaimed this false doctrine amongst men for centuries past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Before the ransom sacrifice was provided by the death of the perfect man Jesus, it was impossible for any man to be granted everlasting life. This is true for the reason that all men are descendants from Adam and have inherited the result of his wrongdoing. (Romans 5:12) It is the rule of God that “as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive”. (1 Corinthians 15:22) The death and resurrection of Jesus Christ must first take place before any man could be granted life everlasting. This, however, Bid not prevent imperfect men from proving their loyalty and faithfulness to God to the extent of their ability. By so doing they could have God’s approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Since, however, there is no other name under heaven whereby salvation to life can come, except through the merit of Christ Jesus, it follows that life could not be granted until the coming of Christ Jesus and the giving of the ransom. He “gave himself [His life] a ransom for all, to be testified in due time”. (Acts 4:12; 1 Timothy 2: 5, 6) It follows that no matter how faithful a man might have proved prior to the giving of the ransom, he could not be granted everlasting life until the ransom is presented as a sin-offering before the mercy' seat of Jehovah God. Therefore the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus brought life and immortality to light. (2 Timothy 1:10) All must have one opportunity for life. The opportunity for immortality is for those-only who seek it according to God's appointed way, to wit, by being made conformable to the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ. —Romans 2: 6, 7; Philippians 3:13-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It now must be apparent to the student of the Scriptures that all that man can do towards saving himself is to have faith and, under the test, to prove his loyalty and faithfulness to God. For this reason it is written: “But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.”—• Hebrews 11:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Between Abel and the cross there were a few men on the earth who believed God and who diligently tried to please Him and did please Him. Concerning these men it is written: “These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. For they that say such things, declare plainly that they seek a country. And truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned: but now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for he hath prepared far them a city.”—Hebrews 11:13-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The word here rendered “country” means fatherland, that is to say, their native town or city or place of abode, or their land of nativity. The native condition of man was perfection in</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Eden; and since it is God’s plan that this condition shall be restored, but that this restoration can come only through his heavenly kingdom; and since these faithful men desired such a thing, they therefore desired the heavenly kingdom or government to be reestablished on earth. God, in the performance of His plan, will therefore provide a city, to wit, an organization, a government, in which these men shall have a part. But who are these men?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Under inspiration of the holy spirit the apostle wrote of and concerning them. (Hebrews, eleventh chapter) First he mentions Abel, who proved his faith in God. Then he tells of Enoch, who walked with God; meaning that he had faith in God and was obedient to Him; and he says that God took Enoch away that he should not see death. Then he mentions Noah, who lived in a time of great wickedness, and who manifested his faith, loyalty and devotion to’ God by proclaiming the truth amidst a wicked and perverse generation. Then comes Abraham, who was called to go out into a place which he knew nothing about; and because of his faith he went. He sojourned in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob. The apostle also mentions Abraham’s wife, Sarah, who manifested her faith in God’s promises. Then he tells of the great test that came upon Abraham when God called upon him to offer up his son Isaac. Believing that God was able to raise Isaac up from the dead Abraham obeyed, and this proves Abraham’s faith in the resurrection. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Then Paul mentions Isaac as one of the faithful. Next he tells of the faith of Jacob who, because of his confidence in God, prophesied and blessed his sons upon his death-bed. He described the faith of Joseph, and how the Lord directed him in Egypt. He then tells of Moses who, although reared in the home of a king, when he came to the years of maturity refused to be called the son of the king's daughter, choosing rather to suffer affliction with his own people because of his faith in God. The apostle adds concerning him: “'Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward.” (Hebrews 11:26) And thus is proven the faith of Moses in the coming kingdom and in the great King. Then the apostle mentions the faith of Rahab the harlot; and he also tells of Gideon, of Barak, of Samson, and of Jephthae.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After mentioning David, and Samuel, and the faithful prophets, the apostle then, grows eloquent, and his words ring with joy and confidence in God when he adds: “Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection: and others had trial of cruel mockings and seourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment: they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; (of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth. And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise.”— Hebrews 11:33-39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The apostle here says, “The world was not worthy” of those men; meaning the world of which Satan the Devil is the invisible ruler. By their faithful devotion to God and to His promises these worthy ones testified that they were completely out of harmony with the Devil and in complete harmony with God. They had true hearts, and did their best to do right; and because of their faithfulness they received a good report. But they could not then receive the promise. Keep in mind that the promise was the blessing of everlasting life, and the apostle plainly says that life is a gift of God through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23) It reasonably follows, then, that they could not get life prior to the giving of the ransom sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Then adds the apostle: “God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.” It is manifest that the class here mentioned as getting the “better thing” are those who will be associated with Christ on the spirit plane, because Paul includes himself as one of them. He says that these faithful men of old without us should not be made perfect. The word here rendered “perfect” means complete, finished, an accomplished purpose. By</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">this then it is to be understood that these men, having received a good report because of their faithfulness must wait in the tomb until the members of the body of Christ are selected and proven. The promise concerning them could not be completed until the Lord has selected the entire diarch. That is to say, God’s purpose and provision for them cannot lie consummated or finished until full and complete provision is made for the invisible part of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the atonement day sacrifice, which God caused the Jews to practise and which is described in the sixteenth chapter of Leviticus, it is shown that the ransom sacrifice is presented as a sin-offering' on behalf of all, aside from the church, after the selection of the members of the body of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When the members of the body of Christ are completed what then is to be expected for these men who died in faith before the great ransom sacrifice was given ? Paul plainly says: “Wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them, a city.” (Heb. 11:16) A city being a symbol of a government, this text is positive proof that God has prepared for these very men in the earth in His government of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Every one of the faithful ones mentioned in the eleventh chapter of Hebrews died before the corning of Christ Jesus, except John the Baptist; and he died before the crucifixion of our Lord. None of those wlio had died has gone to heaven. The clergy have misrepresented to the people that these faithful men were changed from human to spirit beings. Jesus is the best witness concerning that. In discussing the resurrection he said: “No man hath ascended up to heaven.” (John 3:13) At the time He uttered these words faithful Abel had been dead for nearly four thousand years; and all the others in this list, except John, had been dead for centuries. The Apostle Peter, speaking under inspiration, specifically mentions David; and of him he says: “For David is not ascended into the heavens.”—Acts 2: 34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Furthermore the Lord Jesus, to show specifically that John the Baptist is not in heaven, and to remove all doubt that might be in any man’s mind on that point, said: “Verily I say •unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.” (Matthew 11:11) Unequivocally He here states that there has not been, a greater man than John, the Baptist, and yet He says that the very least in the kingdom of heaven wall be greater than John; thus by inference He definitely settles the fact that John the Baptist, who died prior to the crucifixion, could not be in the invisible part of the kingdom. But since the Apostle Paul has so positively stated that God has provided for John and all other ancient worthies a part in the new government or kingdom, where could they be ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It seems quite clear that these are the princes mentioned in Isaiah 32h 1. Those mentioned by the apostle in Hebrews, eleventh chapter, have been recognized as faithful men amongst the Jews; they were even recognized'in David’s day as fathers in Israel. The prophet, after discussing the selection of the church, says: “Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.” (Psalm 45:16) Therefore the conclusion must be reached that these will get their life through Christ, ’which is the only way they can obtain it; hence that they will be called the children of Christ, and that He wall make them princes in all the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The proof therefore seems quite conclusive that these faithful men, who obtained a good report because of their loyalty and faithfulness to God, will receive the promised blessings of life everlasting through Christ, and that the time for receiving these blessings will be when the members of the body of Christ are complete. When they shall receive life the promise concerning them is then complete, therefore they are then completed. Prior to the death of these men they had proved their loyalty and faithfulness, allegiance and devotion to God. He approved them; He waits until He has selected the royal family of heaven, and then the promise is that these men shall be made the visible representatives of The Christ on earth during His reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">No human eye will ever see Christ, the great King. A human eye cannot see a spirit being. Paul saw the reflection of the light from the glorious Christ and that blinded him. God did not intend that men on earth shall see with their eyes the glorified Christ. All men, however, will see or discern the manifestation of His right-eons government. Christ will have on earth just </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">an</span><span class="font9">d true men who will be fully obedient to Him and carry ottt His righteous commandments toward the people. This is so important that you will want some more Scriptural proof. In my next lecture here I shall continue the consideration of the same subject matter and will produce the Scriptural proof that Abraham and other faithful men will be brought back to earth and act in the capacity of official representatives </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">the invisible Christ. Have your note books ready and make notes of the proof at that time.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Two Salvations But No Second Chance</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">[Broadcast from Station WBBR, New York, by R. H. Barber.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">S</span><span class="font9">ALVATION means deliverance from a condition of evil or danger. In Bible usage it means to be delivered from sin and its penalty, which is death.. Every one of my radio audience knows that the curse of sin and death rests upon every member of the human family. Jehovah God has provided a way of deliverance from it through His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ; and this deliverance is what the Bible calls salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To get a proper grasp of the subject it will be necessary for us to know what is really involved in the phrase “sin and death” and how the race came under this curse. According to the Scriptures, God created Adam and placed him in a most beautiful home on a most magnificent estate. That home was in the garden of Eden, and the earth was that estate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">White Adam was given complete control of this estate, yet it was not to be his own possession until he had proven himself worthy to possess it. God’s method of proving him worthy was by requiring him to be obedient to certain laws. If obedient during one day (a thousand years is a day with the Lord), this would demonstrate his loyalty of heart, his faithfulness, and his worthiness to have the home and estate for ever as his c-wn possession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Had Adam won this home it would have brought him everlasting life, peace, health and perpetual happiness, with every other needful thing supplied. Moreover, God told him to multiply and increase and fill the earth with his posterity, and told him that the earth would be the future everlasting home of himself and his descendants, in case he proved worthy to possess it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In proof of all this I desire to quote some portions of the first and second chapters of Genesis. “And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow’ every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. . . . And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to dress it and to keep it. And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.”—Genesis 2:8, 9, 15-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After God had created a helpmate for Adam, in the person of Eve, we read: “And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.”—Genesis 1:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All this is confirmed unto us by the mouth of the Psalmist: “What is man, that thou art mindful of him? . . . for thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. Thou madest him to have dominion over the -works of thy hands: thou hast put all things under his feet: all sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field; the fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.”—Psalm 8:4-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Adam Not Offered a Home in Heaven</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font9"> CALL you all to ■witness that these texts dearly show that Adam was not offered a home in heaven, nor even an opportunity to win a home in heaven. Notice that the texts say: “Thou madest him. to have dominion over the works of thy hands”; namely, sheep, oxen, beasts, fowl and fish. Nearly all Christian people have entirely overlooked this fact, namely, that man was made to live on the earth. The earth was to be his.home for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Let us read some texts that prove that God’s intention is that man shall live on the earth for ever: “The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.” (Psalm 37:29) “For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.” (Proverbs 2: 21) “God himself that formed the earth . . . created it not in vain, he formed it to he inhabited.”—Isaiah 45:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Take these texts in connection with the words of the prophet, which plainly state that “the earth abideth for ever” (Ecclesiastes 1: 4); and those other texts that'tell us that men shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof; that they shall sit under their own vine and fig tree; that the lion and the lamb- shall lie down together and a little child shall lead them, and that the whole earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea. All these texts, and many others indicate that God intends to give man everlasting life on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">'This explains why God did not offer Adam the right to win life in heaven. Adam was simply on trial for life on the earth; and when he failed in that trial he lost his earthly home and estate, and he lost it for himself and also for his children, his descendants. He was unfaithful, disloyal, and hence unworthy of the blessings of life, liberty, peace and happiness on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">According to the Bible Adam never obtained everlasting life; he was on trial for it, but failed to win it. All. he had was an opportunity to win it, under the most favorable conditions possible; and he-failed in that trial because of selfishness and disloyalty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is written that Jesus “came to seek and save that which, was lost”, viz., a right to win life for Adam’s posterity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">No Hint of Eternal Torment &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">OD had told Adam that He would punish him if he disobeyed. He told him plainly what the punishment would be if he ate of the forbidden fruit. God said: ‘Dying thou shalt surely die/ After he had sinned God drove him out of the garden and said-to him: “Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.” There was not a single hint given to Adam that he would be punished with everlasting torment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Everlasting torment is a heathen doctrine taught by those heathen who believed that their gods, .Baal and Molech, were wicked, vicious, cruel and vengeful and had to be propitiated with sacrifices. This heathen doctrine of </span><span class="font10">a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">cruel</span><span class="font9"> God was adopted into the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">so-called</span><span class="font9"> Chrismtian religion, by the “early fathers” of the Catholic Church during the dark ages, when that church reigned supreme. They added to the doctrine terrors that the poor benighted heathen never dreamed of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Protestants foolishly brought the doctrine ■with them when they seceded from, Borne. It was a handy and useful doctrine for the Catholic Church, however; for it, more than any other one thing, has brought many millions of dollars into the Catholic coffers in the way of fees paid for masses to keep dead Catholics from going into eternal torment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Think of the foolishness of paying money to a priest to keep a man who is dead, who knows nothing, who has returned to the dust again as he was, from being tormented eternally. Think also of the responsibility and guilt of those who have accused God of punishing people with such a wicked, cruel and unjust punishment. The only punishment that God mentioned to Adam was </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When Adam, disobeyed, God began at once to enforce'His punishment by bringing- about conditions which would cause the man to die. How did He do this'?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the garden God had placed all the fruits and vegetables that would sustain a human life perfectly. That garden was the only portion of the earth that was finished, perfected; therefore the only portion that had these life sustaining- fruits and vegetables. The rest of the earth was in a wild uncultivated and barren condition, and that explains why God told Adam to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">subdue the earth,</span><span class="font9"> which, means to bring it into a state of cultivation, fertility, perfection, to recover it from its wild condition, and make it like the garden of Eden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Driven out of the garden and left alone to die in the imperfect earth, and having- forfeited God’s favor, Adam did not possess the wisdom to subdue the earth; and being thus left to his own wisdom, his own devices and his own resources, he could not reproduce the necessary perfect foods, and gradually began to die; and at the end of 930 years he was </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">surely dead, </span><span class="font9">and shortly thereafter he returned to the dust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">What Adam Lost</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">W</span><span class="font9">HEN driven out of the garden what had Ada</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">m</span><span class="font9"> lost? It is quite essential that we get clearly before our minds just what Adam,. </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">ha</span><span class="font9">d lost. “For ” said Jesus, “the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.” (Luke 19:10) Now what had Adam lost?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Adam lost his home and estate, his heavenly Father’s care, favor, love and protection; without the necessary perfect food the seeds of disease began to germinate in his body; the dying processes began. Fear of sickness, calamity and death seized hold on the man; under the stress of fear, he became more and more selfish, striving to get all he could out of his present existence. Physical, mental and moral decay quickly followed each other, and gradually but rapidly wrought his degradation </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">from</span><span class="font9"> the glorious image and likeness of God, in which he was created, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font9"> the image and likeness of an imperfect fallen maji. Without God’s favor and blessing, conscious of his guilt and aware of the fact that he was being punished, fear of some impending disaster, drove the man, along the lines of selfishness, to selfishly grasp all he could get, to prepare for some future dire need. Fear is the real root of all selfishness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This inheritance of physical and mental and moral degradation, culminating in sure death, with all its tendencies toward selfishness, is what Adam bequeathed to all his posterity by the law of heredity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Adam’s Degenerate Posterity</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">OpHE physical degradation resulted in all manner of disease, some more and some less loathsome. Selfishness has increased these diseases a thousandfold. The mental degradation resulted in insanity, loss of reason, some more and some less so. Some have lost reason to the extent that they have to be shut up in asylums; some to the extent that they oppress their fellow men, by profiteering, lying to, and defrauding them, and even killing them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some have lost their reason to the extent that they advocate wars against their fellow men; others to the extent that they </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">enjoy</span><span class="font9"> prize fights, bull fights and cock fights; some idiotically use profane language; and others just as idiotically use tobacco, and find pleasure in blowing its smoke and spitting its juice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some have lost reason to the extent that they use morphine and opium, to get some momentary, pleasurable sensations. In Jesus’ day some clergymen lost their reason to the extent that they crucified the Lord of glory, and laughed at his anguish as he hung on the cross.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thousands of clergymen and millions of professing Christians have lost their reason to the extent that they have actually instigated persecutions against those whom they have denominated heretics, and then actually took delight in their shrieks of agony as they have watched them burn at the stake or suffer in the pillory and the rack.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Olliers have lost reason to the extent that they have worshiped stocks and stones and images, the sun, the Ganges river, snakes, the sacred ox, Baal, Molech, everything except the one and only God whose name is Jehovah. The Japanese worship 15,000,000 gods; and most Christians worship a god which they describe as three in one. That beats the heathen Japanese, as an expression lacking sense. Selfishness has increased these </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">mental</span><span class="font9"> idiosyncrasies a thousandfold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Along moral lines men indulge in crimes and vices too numerous and vile to mention here. All these things are a part of the curse of sin and death that Adam brought on the race. The Apostle Paul gives us a good and lengthy description of it all in Romans 1:21-32. I quote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“’When, they knew God, they glorified him not as God, . . . but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an. image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of ■ their error which was meet. And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave theta over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient, to parents, &quot;without understanding, covenant-breakers, wuthout natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: who knowing the judgment of God, that they 'which eoininit such things are ’worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">All Mankind Involved</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">AKE your Bibles' and read these words over and over. It is a terrible and yet an accurate description of the depths of degradation to which the entire race is sunk, as &amp;&nbsp;result of the fact that Adam disobeyed God’s command in Eden. Adam 'was on trial for life. He disobeyed and was sentenced to death. On the contrary, none of Adam’s children were ever on trial for life until after Jesus had died for the race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The record is clear and distinct that all others of the race were condemned in. Adam, before they were born. They were not on trial, and consequently were not </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">sentenced</span><span class="font9"> to death. They were simply </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">born dying,</span><span class="font9"> bora under condemnation. The weaknesses and imperfections of their father, Adam, were passed on to his children, and from father to son ever since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These weaknesses and imperfections have become increased and intensified through succeeding generations, until the condition described in the verses just read prevail. This condition is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font9"> the exception, but the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">rule </span><span class="font9">among all the race, so that the Bible says that there is none perfect, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">no, not one,</span><span class="font9"> for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now let me read some texts showing that the race inherited sin and condemnation from Adam and all their other ancestors. “In Adam all die.” (1 Corinthians 15: 22) “By the offence of one condemnation came upon all men.” (Romans 5:18) “By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men.” (Romans 5:12) In poetic language the prophet pictures this law of heredity in these words: “The fathers have eaten the sour grapes, and the children’s teeth 'are set on edge.”—Ezekiel 18: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">God’s </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Ways Not Man’s Ways</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19280222_files/g_E_19280222-6.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">HUS it can be seen that Adam’s posterity did not have a chance to win life: and as long as they were under the condemnation, they could not have a chance. But God is love. God is good, merciful and kind. His mercy is from everlasting to everlasting. Hie planned to deliver every member of the race-from the condemnation 'which Adam brought upon them, and then to give every member of the race a chance to win life. This, however, would be their first chance, and not their </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">second chance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">God</span><span class="font9"> is the one who makes this offer of life, and He determines the conditions upon which the offer shall be given. Sometimes we hear evangelists and clergymen tell their audience, because they refuse to come to the mourner’s bench, or to shake hands with them, that they&quot;' have refused and denied Jesus Christ. They tell them that they have been given a chance to accept the Savior. This is the height of presumption and impertinence on the part of these religious leaders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">God has never authorized them to make such an offer. Nowhere in His Word does it state that anyone must go to the earthly altar, or penitent form, or mourners’ 'bench, or walk on a sawdust trail, or shake hands with Billy Sunday or any other evangelist or preacher, in order to get salvation, God has His own way of offering salvation, and His Word tells us very plainly what it is. Let us examine it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The race needs two things: First, deliverance from the condemnation which Adaia brought them; and second, an opportunity to win life without the handicaps of sin, tho Devil and inherited weaknesses. Such an. opportunity ’would be their first chance, not their second chance; and God has provided just such </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> deliverance and such an opportunity for every member of the race who will accept it on the terms and conditions which He lays down; and God has provided that those who will not accept it on these terms and conditions shall be destroyed in the second death, not tormented in a lake of fire and brimstone, as our misguided parents and teachers. would have us believe. God is love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">First, let us notice how God purposes to deliver the race from the Adamic condemnation. The Bible tells us that “Christ died for our sins”. Jesus said: “The Father sent the Son into the world to be the Saviour of the world.” The Bible tells us that Jesus’ death was a ransom for all the human family. But what do all these texts mean? They mean that when Jesus died on the cross He took the place of the sinner in death. He became their substitute in death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In 1 Timothy 2:5, 6, we read: “The man Christ Jesus . . . gave himself a ransom for all.” Again we read that He “tasted death for every man”; and still again, that Jehovah “laid on him the iniquity of us all”. This means that Jehovah God counted against Jesus all the sins of Adam and his posterity. It means that Jesus paid the penalty not only for Adam’s sin, but for all the sins of all the people. Notice Romans 5:16: “And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift; for the judgment was by </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font9"> to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Why Belief is Necessary</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19280222_files/g_E_19280222-7.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">UT, we ask, what benefit do we derive from the fact that Jesus died for our sins, and that God laid all these sins on Him? I answer, dear friends, that you get no benefit from it unless you believe it. As proof I quote the words of Jesus Himself, in John 3:16: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot; This text says that to get everlasting life one must </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But what does it mean to believe on Jesus Christ? Does it mean simply to believe that there was a man named Jesus who was crucified on a cross 1895 years ago! and that in gome mystical way we get some benefit from His death? No, it does not mean any such thing. It means that one must first hear that Christ died for our sins. This means that we must realize that we are sinners and that Jesus’ death was an offset for our sins; that we must discern the love of God and of Jesus in the transaction and be </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">grateful</span><span class="font9"> for the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Let me ask my audience some questions: Do you believe that you are sinners ? Do you believe that Jesus paid it all, all the debt you owe? Are you grateful for this fact? Are you so grateful that you will try to serve and please Him during the remainder of your life f If you are not willing to do this you are not grateful at all. Such a stupendous sacrifice as was made by both God and Jesus is worthy of our best efforts in the way of service. Simple gratitude demands some appreciation of the great sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If you believe that Christ died for your sins, and if you are willing to show your gratitude and appreciation to the extent of serving Him to the best of your ability, then, on the basis of this faith God counts you free from the condemnation. This is what the Bible calls </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">justification by faith.</span><span class="font9"> This means that you are justified or made right with God because of your faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">What Constitutes a Chance of Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font9">F AFTER hearing this truth of Jesus’ sacrifice, you do not in your “due time” appreciate it, are not grateful and will not serve Jehovah God, you are unworthy of life and will die the second death. When anyone has thus been delivered from the condemnation, he has an opportunity to win life, his first opportunity, his first chance; and there will be no second chance for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">No one has a chance until he hears of Jesus’ death, and understands what it means. He must understand that it means his only hope of life, that there is salvation in no other. A person may engage in all manner of good works, he may live a most exemplary life so far as morality and honesty are concerned, and yet not be pleasing to God, not even believe in the ransom; and none of his good works or morality will entitle him to eternal life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This is why Jesus said to the self-righteous Pharisees, who boasted of their morality, that the publicans and harlots shall enter into the kingdom before they would. Faith in the ransom sacrifice of our Lord is absolutely necessary to salvation. Everyone must believe that Jesus died for our sins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Anyone who believes that Jesus was God Himself cannot believe in the ransom; he cannot believe that Jesus died, for the reason that God cannot die. Most Christian people do not believe that Jesus actually died. They claim that He only seemed to die, but was in reality more alive than ever when He seemed to die. Those who believe this do not have a proper faith. They .are believing something that is not true. Such cannot be pleasing to God. They must believe the truth; for it is only the truth, that sanctifies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When anyone believes that Jesus was really dead, that His death was a voluntary one, and that it was a ransom price for the race; and when that one’s gratitude to Him is such that it leads him to have an honest, sincere desire to serve the Lord, to do His will and to prove his loyalty and devotion to Him, such a person is freed from the Adamic condemnation, as the apostle points out in Romans 8:1, saying, &quot;There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.” Such a one is rescued or saved from the Adamic condemnation; but he has not yet w’on eternal life. He is now freed from the old condemnation for the very purpose of going on trial for eternal life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Learning the Will of God</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font9">N ORDER to go on trial for life, it is now absolutely necessary that he must know what is required of him in order to win eternal life. This information is found in the Bible, and he must search the Scriptures to know what the will of the Lord is, and having found it he must do it. According to this view, the first thing necessary is to get free from the condemnation of Adam; the second thing necessary is to get a knowledge of the Lord’s will, a knowledge of the truth; and the next thing is to be faithful to that truth, even unto death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now notice the apostle’s words in 1 Timothy 2:3, 4: “For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, who will have all men to be saved, and come unto the knowledge of the truth.” This text says that men must be saved first and then come to a knowledge of the truth. This is the Scriptural way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Going to the Bible we find that God has two different’rewards for those who get free from the Adamic condemnation; one for those who have faith enough to believe His Word during this Christian age, and who have love and zeal enough to study it and find out what His will is, and then have courage enough to do that will regardless of what others think or say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Prize of the High Calling</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font9">F SUCH ones devote their lives to His service and are faithful unto death, Jehovah God promises them the reward of glory, honor and immortality; that they shall come up in the first resurrection and be like the Lord Jesus, see Him as He is, and reign with Him a thousand years. Only 144,000 can get this reward. This is called by the apostle, “The prize of the high calling of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To obtain this prize it is necessary to deny one’s self and follow in Jesus’ footsteps; it is necessary to suffer for righteousness’ sake; it is necessary not only to study the Bible, but to preach the Word, to let our light shine, and to be faithful and loyal to the Lord under adverse circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Those who have been released from the Adamic condemnation because of their faith in the ransom sacrifice of Jesus, and who are thus trying to please and serve the Lord, are having their opportunity to win life now, their first chance; and it will be their last chance. If rebellious, they will go into the second, death. If faithful, great will be their reward in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Nobody could possibly have a chance to win life until first Jesus had given His life a ransom for the race. The first ones to get this chance were the apostles of the Lamb and, since their day, all others who have studied their Bibles and come to a knowledge of the ransom work of Jesus, and consecrated themselves to the Lord, with a determination to wholly and unreservedly do His will. They, and they alone, have been on trial for life. This being true, anyone can see that it is presumption for any clergyman or evangelist to tell a man that he had refused and rejected the Lord just because he ha,d refused to obey the commands to come to the altar or to the mourners’ bench.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19280222_files/g_E_19280222-8.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Ransomed Race</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">FREE the Lord has found the 144,000 faithful ones, and the first resurrection has brought them all together in the kingdom, there remain thousands of millions who have never had a chance to win life. Who are they? The answer is that it' includes all who have ever lived on this earth, who have never heard of the ransom work of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It, of course, will include all who died before Jesus came to the earth and died for them. Everybody must believe on the Lord Jesus Christ to be saved. It is easy to see that all infants who have died could not believe on H</span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">im,</span><span class="font9"> It is self-evident that ail these billions of heathen who have never heard that such a person as Jesus ever lived, who never have seen or heard of a Bible, have never had a chance to win life. It is folly to say that they have had one chance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are millions of professing Christians and' thousands of clergymen who have never had a chance to win life. Why! Because they have not believed that Jesus died for their sins; they do not believe that Jesus died at all; they do not believe the Bible story that He was three days in the tomb, dead, and that it took .the almighty power of Jehovah God to raise Him from the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">They do not believe that Jesus had to die to ransom man from the grave, because they do not believe that anybody is in the grave. They believe that all the good are in heaven and the bad in torment; and if this is true why should anyone need to be ransomed from the power of the grave? .But what is the divine arrangement?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">God’s plan is to awaken all those billions who have not had a chance, and give them a chance, their first chance, and it will be their last chance. He has ordained that this work shall be done during the thousand-year reign ■of Christ during the kingdom of Christ, and that Christ shall do it. That is why Jesus taught us to pray: “Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As a result of Jesus’ ransom work, mankind <sup>:</sup>will be delivered from the Adamic condemnation, and then brought to a knowledge of the truth, and then their responsibility begins, their trial begins. That will not be their second chance. Let us get that thought clearly in mind. The Bible teaches a future probation for all who have never had a probation this life, but future probation for such is in no sense of the word a second chance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now we come to the question: What is the reward of all those who have their trial after the high calling is completed, after the church of 144,000 is resurrected!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Bible answers that if willing and obedient, they shall inherit the land and dwell therein for ever. See Psalm 37:29; Proverbs 2:21; Isaiah 60:21, and hundreds of other texts. This is called by the Apostle Peter the restitution of all things.—Acts 3:19-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Two Salvations and Two Resurrections</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19280222_files/g_E_19280222-9.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">HUS the Bible sets before us two salvations: High calling for the church, and restitution for all the world of mankind. The prize of the high, calling is a heavenly reward. Those who win it will be like Jesus and have divine, immortal, spirit bodies; while restitution is an earthly reward. Those who win it will have bodies like the first Adam, human, terrestrial, earthly bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Those of the race who rebel against God, refuse His mercy and favor and love, will finally be destroyed in the second death. When the last wilful one is destroyed the apostle refers to the completed work of Jehovah as the whole family of God in heaven and in earth. (Ephesians 3:15) Then every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess, both of things in heaven and in earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These two. salvations make necessary two resurrections. And so the Bible calls our attention to the fact that there are two resurrections. Paul says : “There shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.&quot; (Acts 24:15) The just are the faithful church class. They have their trial first and then sleep in the grave until Christ’s second coming, when they are awakened in the first resurrection. On the contrary, the unjust ar® awakened to life, and get their trial after their awakening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This is why Jesus said: “Marvel not at this; for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of man, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">[their trial is over]; and they that have done When God’s purposes, are all accomplished evil, unto the resurrection of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">judgment,&quot;</span><span class="font9"> that everything that hath breath shall praise the is, to have a trial or judgment.—John 5:28, 29. Lord.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">HOMAS:</span><span class="font9"> Good evening,, Paul. Glad to see you again. When are you going to answer my question as to what has become of the last generation of over one thousand millions of the heathen? You seem to think there is some hope for them; and yet, one by one, you close every door against them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font9"> That is right, Paul. And still I think that the important thing to do is to save those that are now living and not waste our time and energy trying to figure out what has become of those who are dead. They are gone, and their destiny is for ever settled. Nothing we can do can help them. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> Don’t be too sure about that, John. I want to ask you a few more questions to bring out some new points on this matter of the fate of the heathen; and then we shall be in better position to know about their destiny. Do you remember having read the statement by the Apostle Paul, in 1 Timothy 2:4-6?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font9"> Just, a minute and I will read it. I have a New Testament right here. Beginning with verse 3, it reads: “For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God -our Saviour: who will have all men to be. saved.”- Why I 'declare, I never noticed that before! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font9"> Yes, but go on. What else does it say?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font9"> “Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> Just a minute, Tom. Did you ever notice </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">that</span><span class="font9"> also?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font9"> Notice what?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> Why, that all men are saved first and come to a knowledge of the truth afterwards?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font9"> It does not say that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font9"> Yes, it does, too. I have it right here in front of me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font9"> I have been reading my Bible all my life and I never saw that in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> That is one of the strange tilings about the Bible. We can not and do not see its greatest truths until they are pointed out to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font9"> Do I understand this scripture to teach that all men are saved first and that after they are saved they then get a knowledge of the truth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> Yes. That is what it says and what it means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font9"> That could not applv to the heathen. In our previous discussions we have . agreed that faith in God is necessary in order to please God, that Jesus is the only way to salvation, that there' is salvation in no other name, that no one can come to Jesus for His saving power unless the Father draw him, that everyone who comes must call upon the name of the Lord to be saved, and can not call unless he has heard the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> But, John, while I fully agree that none can be everlastingly saved' without meeting all the conditions you have just named, yet we must also agree that this text which Thomas is reading shows that all men are surely saved from something first and then afterwards come to a knowledge of the truth. Why not let him go ahead and finish the text?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font9"> All right. I did not mean to interrupt, but I do not intend to agree to one thing one day and then agree to something entirely- different the next. I am a person of fixed ideas; and I do not intend to throw them overboard until I have some better -ones to take their place. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font9"> That is the truth, John. It is just like you all over. But I will go on reading: “Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and one mediator between. God and men, the man, Christ .Jesus: who gave himself a ransom for all.&quot; A ransom for all! Just what does that mean, Paul?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> A corresponding price for everybody. It means that Christ’s death was a. transaction in which every individual member of the human family has a personal and an all-important interest. But go on with your text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas: “A.</span><span class="font9"> ransom for all, to be testified in due time.” Why, I never knew that was in the Bible!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font9"> What was?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font9"> Why, that in due time the testimony is to be borne to all that Jesus paid the ransom price for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font9"> That can not be what the apostle meant. He was not ordained to teach any such gospel as that</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> Read on, Thomas, and see what the apostle has to say of his own gospel message and its value and truthfulness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font9"> &quot;Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time: whereunto I am ordained a preacher and an apostle. (I speak the truth in Christ and lie not:) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity&quot; Most extraordinary! What do you get out of this passage, Paul?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> That it is God’s will, God’s fixed purpose, God’s determination that all mankind shall be saved out of the grave, awakened from the sleep of death; that then they shall be brought to an accurate knowledge of the truth; that the reason for this program is that Jesus died for all men, and obviously, therefore, that as they for the most part had no knowledge of this great fact in the past, they must receive it in the future; and that they shall so receive it. Moreover, the apostle testifies that this is the very gospel he was ordained to preach, and no other; that he is a truthful man, entrusted with a great mission, and his argument therefore is that what he has said is worthy of all belief. Now read what he says two chapters further on, in 1 Timothy 4:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font9"> “For therefore we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those who believe.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">John</span><span class="font9"> Why, that is rank Universalism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> Not at all. It is merely in accord with what he has previously said, that it is God’s purpose first'to save all mankind out of the tomb and then give them an opportunity to believe the truth, that they may be saved finally, saved everlastingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font9"> No, thanks; not for mine! You are teaching two salvations, and that I know is rank heresy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font9"> Hush! That is no way to speak to your cousin. Paul is not teaching anything. He is merely explaining for me ■what I have read out of the Bible in your hearing and what I have now before me in plain sight. Here we have two verses in the same epistle, both agreeing that some sort of salvation comes first and afterward comes knowledge, the basis of belief. That is in line with reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font9"> Well, then, if God can save them first without knowledge, Tie can keep them saved without it; and I guess after all that that is. the right explanation. And now that I think of it I remember that Bishop Foster of the Methodist church said, “Possibly as many of the heathen will be saved without the gospel as with it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> The Bishop was very inconsistent. If his idea that the heathen are saved through ignorance is correct, it would be far better not to send them any missionaries. When the Bishop and his friends send the missionaries to the heathen it seems that nearly all of them are lost; whereas, previously, in their ignorance, nearly all were saved. By the same method of reasoning we might argue that if God had left us and everybody else in ignorance we would all have been saved. If that is the correct view, then the gospel or good news is the very worst of bad news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font9"> That is rich, John. You will have a hard time finding an answer to that argument. The Bishop was discounting the need for his own job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> Let us continue the same line of thought, and let me ask a few* questions on certain texts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font9"> That suits me. Let’s stick to the Bible and keep personal opinions out of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font9"> Yes. But when you find a thing is plainly stated in the Bible you and I have as good a' right to believe it as it reads and to try to understand it as if we had spent our whole lives in a theological seminary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> The text which we have just read states that God will have all men to be saved from something. Does'it not seem reasonable, even if we did not find it in the text itself, that at some time or place the Lord would inform these people what it was that He had saved them from?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font9"> Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> The text which we have just read states that Christ Jesus gave Himself a ransom for all. Does it not seem reasonable that, at some time, God would see to it that those thus ransomed should know something about what had been done for them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font9"> It surely does 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> And now, John, you remember, do you not, that in Hebrews 2:9 it says: “But we see Jesus, who was niade a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor: that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font9"> Yes, it reads that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> Well, if Jesus Christ by the grace of God tasted death for every man, does it not seem reasonable that at some time or other every man for whom He tasted death would have some opportunity to know about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font9"> Of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> Pardon me, Thomas, but I was addressing my remarks to John. What do you say, John!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">John: I</span><span class="font9"> suppose so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> Again, you both remember, do you not, that in 1 John 2:2 that apostle says of Christ Jesus: “And he is the propitiation [or satisfaction] for our sins: and not for ours only, hut also for the sins of the whole world”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">John and Thomas:</span><span class="font9"> Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> Well, if Jesus, in addition to being the satisfaction for the sins of the believers, is also the satisfaction for the sins of the whole world, would it not look reasonable that the whole world would at some time know about this satisfaction rendered on their behalf?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas: I</span><span class="font9"> should certainly say, Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> You remember, do you not, that at the birth of our Savior, the angel of the Lord said to the shepherds, “Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font9"> Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> Well, if the birth of the Savior was ultimately to be good tidings of great joy to all the people, does it not seem reasonable that at some point of time all the people for whom it would be good tidings would know about the tidings themselves?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font9"> Of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> Again. I presume you both remember the oathbound promise made to Abraham, many times referred to in the Scriptures, that “in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed”.—Genesis 28:14 and Galatians 3:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font9"> Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> Well, if eventually all the families of the earth are to be blessed by the promised seed, The Christ, does it not seem'reasonable that there will come a time when they shall know about the blessing thus provided?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font9"> I do not see how anybody can get away from that conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> You have both read in John 1:9: “That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.” When -was every man enlightened by that light?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font9"> I do not know; but it is put in the past tense; it must have been some time in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font9"> There is nothing to indicate that that statement has ever been time. Certainly in heathen lands there are hundreds of millions of whom it is not now true. If it was ever true, it was in the remote past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> It was never true at any time in the past. When Jesus died the Roman world in which He died was grossly heathen, has remained so ever since, and is so at this hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font9"> How then is it to be understood?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> It is a prophetic statement. It looks forward to the time -when Jesus will be the light of every man that has ever been born into the world. It could not be true in any other sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font9"> That sounds like good logic to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> I am sure you are both familiar with Jesus’ own words, “I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me.” (John 12:32) When do you think that promise will be fulfilled?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font9"> When the whole world is converted to Christ. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font9"> If it has to wait for that, it will have to wait for a long time, I am thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font9"> That is the view you always take, the discouraging one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font9"> Not at all, John. It is the sensible one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> Now, now, boys! The point I am making is that there will come a time when all mea</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">n. GOLDEN AGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">will be drawn to Jesus, and that when they are drawn they will surely know something about what is drawing them and what it is all about. That is a proper conclusion, is it not?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font9"> Without question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Paul.- wind finally, along this line of thought, do you not both remember that the Prophet Jeremiah in 31: 34 says of humanity that &quot;they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know<sup>7</sup> the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin no more”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">John (surly):</span><span class="font9"> Yes: It says that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> Now, does that not prove that when the -good times come when the sins of humanity are no more remembered and their iniquity is forgiven that they will be apprised of the matter, be informed about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font9"> It surely says that in so many ■words. They' will be so well informed on the subject that none of them will need to impart the news to anybody else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> There is one item about this matter of the instruction of the heathen that is worthy of our notice here, and that is that it will merely be the bringing of humanity back into channels from which they have long strayed. Truth is natural; error is unnatural. A lie is an invention; and the time will come when all that is false, fabricated, will pass away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In every one of the heathen religions there is probably some trace of the original truths ■which came down through the line of Noah and his family. After the flood we have numerous evidences that God had not been entirely forgotten by everybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thus we read of Melchisedec that he was &quot;'•priest of the most high God” and when he blessed Abram he did it in the name of &quot;the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth”. In the context Abram .explains that this One whom Melchisedec thus honored is &quot;'Jehovah, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth”. (Genesis 14:18-22) We suppose that Melchisedec was Shem. In any event he had knowledge of the One we now honor and adore as Jehovah, and was His servant and minister. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Eliezer, the servant of Abraham, was as reverent a worshiper of Jehovah as Abraham himself. When Laban greeted Eliezer he did it in the name of Jehovah, showing that he had reverence for that name. Even Abimelech, who treated Isaac so unfairly in reference to the wells which had been dug. by Abraham, had reverence for Jehovah’s name, saying to Isaac, &quot;We saw<sup>7</sup> plainly that Jehovah was with thee” and that &quot;'Thou art now the blessed of Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Even Balaam, from far away Mesopotamia, knew something about Jehovah and, indeed, claimed that whatever he would speak would be spoken as from Him. Thus it is evident that there were at least some worshipers of the true God in his land. But gradually, because they did not like to retain a knowledge of God, the Devil used one means or another to blot it out. Cyrus was a worshiper of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the oldest religions, obscured by myths and superstitions, are references to the vanquisher of hades, the Son of God, the perfect sacrifice and the redeemer from sin. It is believed that these names and the Chinese name of Shang-Ti, which means Most High, the Highest, or the Lord God of heaven, may be traced to the fact that Shem lived so long after the flood. It should not be forgotten that Noah and Abraham were contemporaneous for eight years, and Shem lived contemporaneously with Abraham for one hundred fifty years. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">God loves the heathen and has a definite plan for their recovery. When Jesus tasted death for every man He tasted death for the heathen. The glad tidings of great joy to all men is glad tidings for the heathen, too. When Jesus gave Himself a ransom for all it was a ransom for the heathen also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the far East the Japanese and Chinese and other nations cherished a very ancient tradition that at some time God would descend to the earth in a visible form, to enlighten men and to redeem them from their sins. Virgil, Tacitus, Suetonius and Josephus all bear witness that for ages there prevailed throughout the East an intense conviction that a child from heaven was looked for that would restore the golden age and take away sin. In China, about 500 B. C., Confucius prophesied such a deliverer; and a deputation of his followers, going forth in search of him, was the means of • introducing Buddhism into China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In view of all these things we can see how poor humanity has been feeling after God, if haply they might find Him. And it rejoices my heart to know that this feeling after Him will not, in the end, be in vain. All heathendom will get the reconciliation with God which they desire, and with it they will get the opportunity of regaining everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas:</span><span class="font9"> And yet with all this intensely interesting information, you have not yet answered my question as to what has become of the last generation of the heathen, those who have most recently died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">John:</span><span class="font9"> I am waiting to hear the answer to that question, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paul:</span><span class="font9"> Don’t be in a hurry, boys. We will get to that sooner or later. We have the whole winter to answer it in. In the meantime you can get the answer to it yourself if you will get Judge Rutherford’s book on </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Where Are the Dead?</span><span class="font9"> Or you will also find the question answered in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Divine Plan of the Ages. </span><span class="font9">Sometime soon I will be down and see you again, and we will look into some further phases of this question. But now I must be going.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font9">HE London </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Express</span><span class="font9"> contains an article which in itself is uninteresting, being merely one of the customary attacks on Judge Rutherford and the Bible Students which mature Christians in all parts, of the world have come to expect as a matter of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The article does contain the statement, true in part, that “Rutherford’s books and pamphlets are distributed free all over the world, and are said to have had a circulation of more than 50,000,000 copies”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It also says that “a million and a quarter copies of Rutherford’s new pamphlet </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom for the Peoples</span><span class="font9"> have been distributed free throughout the British Isles during the last month. A further 500,000 are on the way from the printing presses of Brooklyn, U. S. A., and millions more, translated into various languages, are being prepared for world-wide circulation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As a whole the article is defamatory and written in a bad spirit, but it does contain the significant headline “'Bible War Against the Empire”, and that headline is not a bad one </span><span class="font10">at </span><span class="font9">all. That is just about the truth. And as Judge Rutherford did not write the Bible, but is merely explaining it, and pointing to it, the war, after all, is God’s war; for God is the Author of the book, and the fight is His fight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If anybody doubts who will come out victorious in that war, all we have to say is that he knows very little of what the Bible contains and has little ’knowledge of the One that is directing the fight.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Isaiah and His Message</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">juvenile Bible story radiocast from Station WORD, Chicago, by C. D. Nicholson.]</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">[A</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">O</span><span class="font9">F ISAIAH’S boyhood we have no direct information. However, he was the son of Amoz, and was born somewhere in Palestine about two hundred years before the children of Israel were taken captive to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar, after which their land lay 'desolate for seventy years because of their failure to obey the commandments of the Lord. It is quite evident that Isaiah began his work as a prophet of Jehovah before he became a full-grown man, perhaps about the time he was eighteen or twenty years of age. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Isaiah took a great interest in the instructions which the Lord had given to the people of Israel and was grieved because those instructions were not obeyed by them. He therefore felt it his duty to remind the people of the blessings which they were missing by their failure to live according to Jehovah’s instructions. Isaiah did other things besides the work of a prophet, but his principal mission in life was to write or declare the messages of the Lord. His prophecies fill sixty-six chapters of the Bible; they were given over a period of about sixty years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Through his prophecies, Isaiah told of events that should happen in the future to the people of Israel; for a prophet is one who writes history in advance, sometimes thousands of years before it happens. He told Israel of their wayward course and the results which were sure to follow; of their final overthrow at the hands of the king of Babylon and the restoration again to their own land of a small remnant of the Hebrew people. However, the major portion of Isaiah’s prophecies were of a much broader character.and referred to events which should happen several hundred years, and even, thousands of years, in the future; to events which would affect all mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Whatever Isaiah wrote should be accepted as absolutely trustworthy because Jesus and His apostles and disciples who wrote the New Testament quoted from his prophecies fiftyeight times. Isaiah is generally called the Messianic- prophet because he wrote so much about the coining of a Savior of mankind. He was the first of all the prophets to tell how and. when the Savior should come. However, until recent times, most people, including Christians, overlooked the fact that Isaiah wrote a great deal more about the second coming of Christ and what it will mean to all mankind than he did of our Lord's first presence on earth as the man Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The fifty-third chapter of Isaiah refers almost wholly to Jesus and His experiences at His first advent; However, on the other hand, there are many places where Isaiah refers to the second presence of Christ on earth as the great King of kings and Lord of lords, when every knee shall bow to Him and confess Him. A familiar expression, “in that day,” is used by Isaiah forty-four times and nearly every one of these expressions is to be fulfilled at or during the second presence of Christ, when He comes to establish the kingdom spoken of by all the prophets and writers of the Bible, both in the Old Testament and in the New.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One' of the most interesting prophecies found in the Bible appears in Isaiah 33:24. It describes something that is to be fulfilled at the second presence of Christ. It says, “And the inhabitant shall, not say, I am sick; the people that dwell therein [in the land] shall be forgiven their iniquity [or sin].” What do you think of that? The time is coming when there will be no sickness!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another of the Lord’s prophets, John, in. the book of Revelation speaks of that happy time. He says, “And God shall wipe away’all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new.”—Revelation 21:4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What a wonderful thing to know that death is to cease; that pain and. sickness will be no more; that sorrow and sighing shall flee away; and that there will be no tears, nor anything to hurt nor destroy in all God’s holy kingdom; a complete new order of things; a new religious order and a new ruler of earth, with Satan put out of business and all his evil work of 6,000 years undone by the Prince of Peace I Couldn’t you just shout for joy as you think of the peace, happiness, joy and pleasure with which all mankind are to be blessed under the rulership of the great Messiah* How good it</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">is to know that these blessings are near at tell us about that wonderful kingdom? When hand! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you pray to God, will you not thank Him for</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">Ar</span><span class="font9">e you not glad that God used Isaiah to Isaiah and for His wonderful Message?</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">UESTION:</span><span class="font9"> What is the kingdom of God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font9"> . The kingdom of God is a government ordained to the praise of Jehovah anti the blessing of mankind. Jesus preached the kingdom of heaven while-here upon earth. In Mark 1:14 we read: “Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God.” Jesus instructed His disciples to pray, as is stated in Matthew 6:10, “Thy kingdom come. Thy wall be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” In this kingdom there will be two'parts; the ©ne a heavenly and ruling part, and the other composed of ■ the subjects upon the earth. In God’s kingdom Christ Jesus is King; and His church, composed of 144,000 faithful individuals, will reign with Him. Christ Jesus and His reigning followers will be spirit beings, invisible to mankind, and will have the privilege of blessing mankind by bringing them into harmony with the law of the heavenly Father, Jehovah God. It will take a thousand years, according to the Bible to bring mankind to a state of perfection. In Revelation 20:6 we read, “Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.” This reigning and heavenly class of individuals will have been taken from the peoples of earth. This class will be composed of the faithful followers of Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now let us consider the other class of individuals in the kingdom. ' This will be an earthly class. Mankind, including all of the heathen, will be the subjects of the kingly class. Billions of heathen will come forth from the tomb and come to the knowledge of the truth; and, if obedient, they will be granted everlasting life on earth. Among the subjects of the kingdom will be many who have been in the church organizations, but who never understood the Bible at all. They never had any desire to go to heaven; they would be satisfied to live on earth for ever. If obedient they will be granted that desire. It is the purpose of the kingdom to bring mankind into harmony with God. All of the obedient will be made serviceable in God’s organization and will be a praise to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font9"> If in the kingdom one persists in a wicked course, what will become of him?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font9"> The Bible clearly* states what will become of the wicked. In Ezekiel 18: 20 we read, ‘“'The soul that sinneth, it shall die.” In Psalm 37:10 the record has it, “Yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be; yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.” In the kingdom Christ Jesus is spoken of as the Great Prophet, or Teacher. In Acts 3: 23 we read, “Every soul, which will not hear that prophet [Christ Jesus], shall be destroyed from among the people.” Thus while God will give everlasting life to the obedient, the punishment of the wicked will be everlasting death. In Romans 6:23 we read, “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We must remember that the wicked are those who -wilfully choose to sin when they have the ability and knowledge to live in harmony with righteousness. -Nowhere in the Scriptures is there any indication that such will have any part in the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font9"> In what service or activity can man find the greatest satisfaction and be of the greatest benefit to others!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font9"> Man finds greatest satisfaction and is of the greatest benefit when he fills the purpose for which he was created. And for what purpose was man made! The Lord answers this question in Isaiah 43:7: “I have created him for my glory.” In Psalm 145:10 we read, &quot;All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord.® Therefore man finds his estate, the purpose of his existence, when he uses all of his faculties in the service of Jehovah God and to His praise.</span></p>
