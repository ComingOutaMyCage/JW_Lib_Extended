<p><span class="font10">The Herald of Peace</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font6">N ISSUE of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Herald of Peace,</span><span class="font6"> Lemoore, California, is before us, and we have read it with interest and satisfaction. Its object is to abolish war. It has no set program, but it has ideas, lots of them, and information in great quantities. We copy some of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In his opening editorial the editor, E. L. Pratt, says of the causes of war:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bismarck admitted that cupidity is the prime cause of war. But Bismarck was not honest enough to present the reverse side of the situation by calling attention to the fact that in the satisfaction of its hunger, the stronger nation took away from the weaker one all of these things: life and the materials with which, to support home and country, all that helped to make its own civilization worth while; and that in the end only a few of the very wealthy profited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Civilization acknowledges life as sacred, and the common law declares that the killing of a human being is a capital crime. If the taking of a single life constitutes the greatest felony, by what words shall we designate the acts of any nation that deliberately destroys human, life masse, destroys it with no reason or excuse other than a desire to gain the possession of the vanquished nation in order to add to the surety and comfort of its own existence?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is the same act, motivated in the same manner, and differing only in scale, that we find recorded in our daily newspaper’s account of individual sordid crime. The desire of one man for the money carried by another, this money evidencing potentially better conditions of living, comfortable housing, good clothing, palatable and nutritious foods, the lessening of strenuous effort for existence, leads him to attack the more fortunate man, and results in the despoiling and perhaps the death of the victim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Multiply this incident by a thousand, by ten thousand, by a million, and we name it war, instead of robbery or murder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But there is this difference between the two acts. There is no assured immunity from punishment for the individual criminal. He is aware that, however successful he may be in committing the crime, he faces the possibility of immediate and drastic retribution at the hands of an outraged community. But the nation, that instigates war, and brings that war to a successful conclusion in the furtherance of its own selfish aims, is not punished; is not even arraigned and judged at the bar of public opinion, as represented by other nations. The aggressor, if victorious, is permitted to retain and to enjoy his pirated plunder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of his contributors, Wade R. Parks, attorney at law, Plains, Montana, gives some further ideas along the same lines, saying in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That wars are promoted and supported for the same reasons that other enterprises are generally promoted, should by now be a common-place idea. All enterprises of wide-reaching consequences are promoted and conducted to produce profits. Did not President Wilson, in a noted address, declare that the building of the Bagdad railroad was the straw that broke the camel’s back in 1914 and caused the war? In other words, Germany’s enterprise to get her &quot;wares on to the world’s market at some points theretofore a practical monopoly of some of her commercial competitors was very offensive, injurious, and objectionable to some of her commercial rivals, and the war that resulted put Germany out of the race for commercial supremacy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And did not all who were pecuniarily interested in the war babies want war in 1917 ? Moreover, did not the Declaration of War in 1917 make business good for some time? Did not enterprising Americans in all lines of industry make unprecedented profits? And when the Hon. Eobert M. La Follette, in the United States Senate, proposed a financial measure which would tax into the United States Treasury all the profits made out of the enterprises that waxed fat on the war, did not the spokesman of the profiteers spread broadcast the poison-gas to the effect that La Follette was a pro-Ger-man, and otherwise assassinate his good name and character ? And did not The Associated Press broadcast a 100% lie concerning a statement of the late Senator La Follette regarding a speech he made in a mid-West metropolis during the war, all to glorify war and damnify the peace-makers?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A modest little news squib puts considerable into thirty-six words when it says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Nation</span><span class="font4"> calls appropriate attention to the fact that when a revolution broke out, recently, in Portugal, endangering American life and property, the administration sent no marines there to protect either. Evidently no oil in Portugal!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">General Tasker II. Bliss, of the United States Army, is quoted as authority for the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If nations are armed to the limit against each other, and each knows that the armament of the other has no use against any other than himself, can we not all see that when one approaches its limit, and believes the other to be capable of further expansion, war, without warning, is inevitable?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Pax International</span><span class="font6"> is given credit for an item that should bring to an end an international disgrace:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the handsome facade of the United States postoffice are carved these striking words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">'•'Carrier of News and Knowledge, Instrument of Trade and Industry, Promoter of Mutual Acquaintance, of Peace, and of Goodwill Among Men and Nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is a splendid sentiment—a fine standard for over the doorway of the main postoffice of this great country, but letters going out of these same doorways are not carrying out the spirit of this banner. The cancellation stamp, &quot;Let’s Go—Citizens’ Military Training Camps,” bears no such ideals as “Peace and Goodwill Among Men and Nations”. It flaunts the junker spirit of the military party before all the high-minded, peace-loving citizens of the nation, and, what is more to be deplored, this very postoffice, with its high-sounding phrases, denies them a thousand times a day as United States letters go into foreign lands, advertising the new jingoism of America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So much for the causes of war; and now something about some phases of</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>The World War Itself</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE first is an extract from “The War Myth in United States History”, by C. H. Hamlin, which tells us all about the Government’s official and duly accredited first-class A Number One liars and deceivers extraordinary, with a good idea of just what to expect when more liars are needed for the same kind of work. Mr. Hamlin said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After the United, States entered the war in April, 1917, we immediately created a government propaganda bureau, which was employed to arouse popular hatred; an official daily newspaper known as the “Committee on Public Information”, with George Creel as chairman. Since the war, Mr. Creel has given us an account of the propaganda activities in his book, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">How </span><span class="font4">We </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Advertised America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No effort was made to present the truth. Allied propaganda was accepted and to it we added ours. This “Committee on Public Information” issued. 75,099,023 pamphlets and books to encourage the public “morale”. They hired the services of 75,000 speakers who operated in 5,200 communities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Altogether, about 755,190 speeches were made by these people known as the “Four Minute Men”. Exhibits were given at fairs, and war films were prepared for the cinema, from which the “Committee on Public Information” received a royalty. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.</span><span class="font4"> total of 1,438 drawings was issued which had a circulation of 100,000 copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A propaganda bureau was established by the United States in the capitals of every nation in the world except those of the central powers. The total expenditure by the United States for propaganda was $0,738,223. (See George Creel, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">How</span><span class="font4"> We </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Advertised America,</span><span class="font4"> chapter one.) This was the greatest fraud ever sold to the public in the name of patriotism and religion. The Espionage act was passed making it illegal to spread “false” reports that would hinder recruiting. Every report was false which, did not harmonize with the propaganda released by this “Committee on Public Information”. The best we can now say for Mr. Wilson and the American public is that they were the victims of allied propaganda, and contributed to the wrecking of European civilization through deception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As to the sinking of the Lusitania Mr. Pratt himself lets us in for the following interesting item:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sale of one automatic six-shooter may mean the death of one citizen; the sale of a quantity of munitions of war may mean the slaughter of thousands. It is said that the Lusitania undertook to carry to the theatre of war, eleven hundred cases of ammunition. If that is true, each case cost the sacrifice of one life, when the ship, with its precious cargo of human freight, was sent to the bottom of the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As to what a battle-field looks like, he quotes from Winston Churchill’s pen a description of what Churchill himself saw:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The anatomy of the battles of Verdun and the Somme were the same. A battlefield had been selected. Around this battlefield walls were built—double, triple, quadruple—of enormous cannon. Behind these railways were constructed to feed them, and mountains of shells were built up. All this was the work of months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus the battlefield was completely encircled by thousands of guns of all sizes, and a wide oval space prepared in their midst. Through this awful arena all the divisions of each army, battered ceaselessly by the enveloping artillery, were made to pass in succession, as if they were the teeth of interlocking cog-wheels grinding each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For month after month the eeaseless cannonade continued at its utmost intensity, and month after month the gallant divisions of heroic human beings were torn to pieces in this terrible rotation. Then came the winter, pouring down rain from the sky to clog the feet of men, and drawing veils of mist before the hawk eyes of their artillery. The arena, as used to happen in the Coliseum in those miniature Boman days, was flooded with water. A vast sea of ensanguined mud, churned by thousands of vehicles, by hundreds of thousands of men and millions of shells, replaced the blasted dust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Still the struggle. continued. Still the remorseless wheels revolved. Still the auditorium of artillery roared. At last the legs of men could no longer move; they wallowed and floundered helplessly in the slime. Their food, their-ammunition lagged behind them along the smashed and choked roadways.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>The Results of the War</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">S TO the results of the war nothing much need be added to what U. S. Senator George</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">W. Norris said of it, except that we were all told that this war would purify mankind, make the world safe for democracy and give our children a better place in which to live. Senator Norris tells what we actually got:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The real heritage of the war is to be found hero at home. It was here that the soul.of America was to have been purified. The millions of our youth who went into that orgy of murder were promised a new’ and better order of things. For the thousands of our young men killed, and maimed, for our billions spent, for the countless millions of heartaches, we have what? We have political corruption such as was never dreamed of before, we have a new crop of millionaires such as the world has never before witnessed, we have a crime wave that staggers the imagination of the world, we have gigantic, war-grown combinations of trade and money that are squeezing billions annually out of the people who &quot;gave till it hurt”, and they are doing it under the fawning and paternalistic eye of the government. We have a national avarieiousness, and sense of grab, grab, grab, that can not be eradicated from the national consciousness for generations to come. This we have. Why? Because the war did what- a few of us believed it would do—it stupified and paralyzed the moral consciousness of the American people as nothing else could have done, and because it was a war of gigantic commercial interests from beginning to end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">War is a great civilizer! 0 yes I It is necessary for Christian nations to go to 'war with the heathen so as to teach them the principles of true Christianity! Is it? Well:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the Maori War of 1860, rumor reached the native chiefs that the British commanders forces, waiting for the river steamships, were short of food. Under a flag of truce the chiefs sent down a fleet of boats laden with milch cows and other food, with a communication saying &quot;there was no glory in fighting hungry men”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But surely the people get something out of a great war, do they not? Yes, they do not I Here is what they get. We find this in Mr. Pratt’s new paper from the pen of one of our old contributors, II. E. Branch:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our- public has been paying interest for sixty years on •$346,000,000 Civil War debt, and the interest paid by the public without valuable consideration—something for nothing- -now amounts to more than thirty times the face of the original debt. Our banking institutions owe their depositors and stockholders about $60,000,000,000. Our government debt, counting greenbacks, federal reserve notes, emergency currency, short time notes, $13,000,000,000 to Europe, treasury notes, silver certificates, gold certificates, national bank notes, subsidiary coinage, thrift stamps, baby bonds and Liberty Bonds, aggregate at least $50,000,000,000. The public paid their face value of bogus government debts in cash, met its demands with the real goods (money wrung from widows and orphans and farmers), the cash resources that- performed our part in the World War without debt, $50,000,000,000 in actual service, the only-means of ultimate payment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dr. David Starr Jordan, ex-president of Stanford University, enlivens the paper by a paragraph which says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our country, which so many people pretend now is so very rich, is not so wealthy as it was before the war. Our farmers and various other classes are bled to death to make the wealth of the comparatively few that sold armament and other things to the allies to be paid for by the extra cost which the Liberty bonds and other devices forced upon the common people of America.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>What We Learned from the</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font6">HAT the peoples of the earth learned from the World War can he summed up in one sentence, with only one word in the sentence: Nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Secretary Mellon, in his annual report for 1925, admitted that seventy cents of every dollar raised by taxation goes to wars past and future. Other students of such matters put the percentage very much higher. Imagine the head of a .family wasting seventy percent of his income in. buying fire arms with which to kill the head of some other family!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Napoleon once said that a great soldier like himself cared nothing for the lives of a million men. He once said that he would not hesitate to tell a lie to gain a point. His last child was born to a servant to whom he was unmarried.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Napoleon was a murderer, a liar, a thief and an adulterer. Who wants to be like Napoleon? Napoleon was honest enough to say that if he gave liberty to the press his power could not last three days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The coffins of the eleven million men killed in the World War, placed side by side, and touching one another, would reach from Vladivostok to Paris. Placed endwise and five feet apart they would reach around the earth at the equator. But experience has taught us that we learn not one thing from experience except how to make bigger fools of ourselves the next time we get a chance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">S TO preparation for the last war Edward Berwick is quoted from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Peninsula Review</span><span class="font6"> as saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1918 our Congress appropriated $100,000,000 for the expenses of our chemical warfare (gas) service, and allotted 48,000 men thereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sixty-three poison gases were used in the war, of which twenty-six were classed as lethal (deadly). Our Edgewood Arsenal was turning out weekly 815 tons of gas-producing compounds against 410 tons made in Britain, 285 tons in France and only 210 tons in Germany. Edgewood and auxiliaries were almost ready to produce 13,000 tons monthly. One of the Edgewood staff told me the stuff was so hurtful that for only six actual workers in the &quot;mustard” gas section there were ninety in hospital, gas-disabled. At the time of the Armistice the G. W. service was engaged in sixty-five &quot;major research problems”, including eight gases more deadly than any already in use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One airplane can carry enough material to destroy all life in a strip of territory 100 feet wide and seven miles long. A few dozen such could wipe out. any metropolis, regardless of entrenchments, fortresses, or a million armed men. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An article by R. P. Benjamin outlines some of the features of the next war. It says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A chemical conflict in which cradles will be no safer than the trenches; in which hundreds of planes will sweep through fire-devastated regions, dropping bombs filled with a gas that will completely annihilate every vestige of life which may be left, even down to the birds and the insects; a war involving entire noncombatant populations in its fury, destroying the infants and the aged in their beds in the same impersonal manner as the soldiers in the trenches—this is what another great .war will mean!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Gas in. the last war proved more effective in killing people than rifle bullets. It burns, suffocates and blinds —puts people out of action quickly. Furthermore, it is terrifying and likewise difficult to guard against since gas masks now require careful adjustment. An old person or a child would find themselves defenseless. Perhaps ability to put a mask on quickly wouldn’t make much difference anyway, because masks now are valuable only against the known gases. A new kind of gas would penetrate them as though they were non-existent I It is to be presumed that government chemists are working on such gases now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What of our women and children, expectant mothers, infants and our old people, our sick and our poor helpless insane? Blinded, burned, maimed, killed! Our peaceful countryside destroyed by fire; crops—the great wheatfields—-ruined by poisonous chemicals dropped, in bombs from enemy planes. A hideous, horrible prospect?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then we have some of the cold-blooded statements of those who believe in war and want it, with all its accessories. One of those, apparently, is Ernest McCullough. Writing in the New-York </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The chief object of fighting is not to kill. The creation of casualties is of far greater importance. Morals is hurt by the sight of suffering men waiting for ambulances, and ambulances choke the roads needed for advancing troops and munition trains. Each dead man is one man removed from the ranks of fighters, but a casualty means several men out of fighting. Warfare gas is the cheapest ammunition: it creates casualties by wholesale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then there is an official statement on lethal rays and germ warfare. This is a summary by Editor Pratt:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Major-General E. D. Swinton, a British expert, states that progress is being made in the development of rays for lethal purposes. &quot;We have X-rays,” he says. “We have light rays. We have heat rays. We may not be so very far from the development of some kind of lethal ray which will shrivel, up or paralyze or poison human beings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">General Swinton prophesies the coming of germ warfare. “I think it will come to that,” he says, “and so far as I can see there is no reason why it should not. We must envisage these new forms of warfare and as far as possible expend energy, time and money in encouraging our inventors and scientists to study the waging of war on a wholesale scale instead of . . . thinking so much about, methods which, will kill a few’ individuals only at a time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Trying to Prevent Another War</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19281017_files/g_E_19281017-4.png" alt="" style="width:12pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">N. McCakteb, attorney and counselor at » law, Stanton, N. D., tells what he thinks of the chances of legally preventing another- war:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It would require legislation to prevent war, and that we could never get through the Congress of the United States. We might get it through the States., but not through the corrupt, rotten government as made and constituted today. If we could get legislation to the effect that no war could be declared until the matter had been taken up with, and voted on by the people, then there would be no more war. Or if we could compel those who stir it up, to do their part of the fighting, then, again, there would be no war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If we could dethrone money—put it back to its primitive position as a medium of exchange only instead of being used as it now is as a means of oppression—and cease to loan it for interest, so that no one could afford to hoard it up, and hold it for hire, then, too, this would have its effect on the war problem; but, as it is today, the moneyed lords of this country can raise hell and cause </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a war</span><span class="font4"> at any time they want to. If they can force our boys to go to foreign countries, as they did in the last war, they can do anything else they want to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The men who profit by war are the ones who stir it up, and they are so intimately associated with our U. S. senators and congressmen that all they have to do is to get the subsidized press to yowling about how we are being abused by some other nation of people, and in a very short time they will have most of the “soft boiled” straining at their leashes to get to cut some pacifist’s throat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The moneyed gods have the money, arsenals, arms, men and the big press to back them up; and as long as they have, and as long as about eighty-five percent of the people are so gullible, about every fifty years (it requires about that long for fools to forget) we will have war. It reminds me of how near we came Just recently to trouble with Mexico, because some of our multi-millionaires were bound to ignore the laws of Mexico and do as they please in that country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Leroy L. Reading says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the late President Harding, standing on the docks at Hoboken,, surrounded by 6,000 caskets containing the bodies of men who had given their lives in that great world struggle, declared “This must not be again”, his words found an echo in the hearts of millions of his countrymen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Editor Pratt thinks enough of a sentiment of President Coolidge to quote it twice in his paper:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If this generation fails to devise means for preventing war, it will deserve the disaster which surely will be visited upon it. Later generations will not be likely to act if we fail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Justice Clark of the U. S. Supreme Court is quoted as saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Either civilization must destroy war, or war will destroy civilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Herald of Peace</span><span class="font6"> has started on a good errand. When it sees that the clergy are the blessers and sanctifiers of war it will take another long stride ahead. In due time it may get to see Judge Rutherford’s true position that the only way to oust the Devil’s organization, his politicians, his press, his plutocrats and his preachers, is for the common people to withdraw their support, when they will surely go down. Something like this true solution of the problem is vaguely seen from one angle by one of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Herald’s</span><span class="font6"> contributors, Leroy L. Reading, when he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And America has another powerful weapon. Let the world know that America will not finance a war. Let it be understood that this rich nation has billions for promoting the progress of peace, but not one cent for war, and there would be sudden cooling of the passions of Europe. Make no mistake about this: the common people can readily force their beliefs upon the men of money. It is not individual money which goes to purchase foreign bonds: it is the money deposited in banks by the people. If the people resolutely set their faces against the lending of their money for warfare, the bankers will promptly bow to their wishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Pasadena Ostrich Farms</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font6">T SOUTH PASADENA, California, one of the show sights is the Cawston ostrich farm, where are to be found great numbers of the descendants of the original flock of fifty birds brought from Africa thirty-five years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In size the ostrich reaches a height of eight feet or more, often weighing as much as three hundred pounds. The eggs are ivory in color, of huge proportions and frequently weigh as high as five pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No pains are spared in the handling of these eggs. They are hatched by the incubator process or by the mates, which take turns on the nest, the males at night and the females during the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For four days after hatching the baby ostrich goes without food. At the end of this time it begins to eat gravel, alfalfa, grain, oranges, vegetables, and from time to time, small rocks and other hard substances as an aid to digestion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Plumage is first clipped approximately three months after the young ostrich has reached its maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The ostrich is driven into a comer and a hood is drawn over -its head. This renders it docile and easily handled, and while one attendant holds it, another clips its plumes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In no case are plumes plucked. They are clipped close to the skin by an absolutely harmless process. Only the wing and tail feathers from the male birds are taken.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE perfection by the Eastman Company of apparatus for taking and reproducing amateur motion pictures in colors now suggests to radio engineers the possibility of television in colors, accompanied by all the sounds that accompany the spectacles photographed. In other words it would seem that feeble man, with the instruments placed in his hands by the Creator, is being made to see that every word of the Bible is true, and that when the statement is made that all things are naked and open before Him with whom we have to do, it means just that. God’s television arrangements are perfect. Nothing more need be said. In due time every crooked and evil thing that has ever transpired in the world will be shown in its true colors 'before the eyes of all men. Goodness will be rewarded and evil will get its just recompense, and all will approve.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">A T Ridley College, Melbourne, several -f* hundred young men are in training for the Anglican ministry. Their ages are not known to us, but they seem to be about on a level with the small boy in knee pants, except that they are not so well-behaved. Just why the seniors in such a school should seize the freshmen at 2.00 a.m., take them out of their beds, and forcibly feed them with mustard until they screamed with pain^ we do not know. It seems that it is an annual custom. It was carried on in the immediate neighborhood of a hospital in which a man lay dying, until the hospital authorities invoked the aid of the police, and they put a stop to it. These young men are mentally some hundreds of years behind the times. They live back in the dark ages and will make a fine lot of preachers of the doctrines that belong to that ungodly and beastly epoch.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark84"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark85"></a>Just Folks </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By B. E. Plnnocli</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6">T IS a real education to come in contact with hundreds of new people every week and to note their response to the message of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> as to the outcome of the present transition in human affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An ordinary salesman is more interested in the financial standing of his prospect than in his qualities of heart and intellect; but, with one presenting the good news of the kingdom, his immediate interest is in the man, in his religious sympathies, and in his heart attitude to the world-wide distress, whether it has touched him lightly or roughly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The tremendous upheavals that have rocked the structure of society have affected every member in it, have jolted humanity out of the pre-war rut; and now one can speak to the inhabitants of inland towns and find a keen interest in the prospects of the solution of the world’s problems, social, economic, political, financial and religious. A’ message that boldly declares God’s certain remedy, independent of human enterprise, is received with a mixed feeling of hope and fear. (Some seem to feel that the affairs of the nations are not in a condition to bear the scrutiny of a righteous God.) Those who have a goodly share of the world’s wealth often oppose the suggestion of a radical change in the present order, notwithstanding the assurance that the true values of life, liberty, health, happiness, peace and prosperity everlasting for all of good-will shall obtain in the incoming kingdom. This, of course, is done thoughtlessly, and a little patient endeavor to bring it home to the individual demonstrates the universal appeal of the message of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I spent a strenuous ten minutes at one comfortable large home, vainly trying to impress one mother with the importance of understanding the outcome of present events. My eyes wandered around the sumptuous living rooms; the well-kept garden outside dispatched a fragrance through the open door. On every hand, evidence of culture and taste. Could I blame her that her vision did not reach out over the world? These things I spoke of had not penetrated through the protection of her comfort and security. I turned to go, to press on with the witness, to find those with “ears”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two chubby boys came tumbling in from play and the mother’s eyes lit up with pride. Turning quickly I asked, Have you any assurance that your two babies will not be dragged off to the trenches in a few years? Have the nations learnt anything from the last war? Instantly the apathy left her and a fear that had evidently been kept buried sprang into her eyes and drove the color from her checks. Quietly I restated the message of the Bible to the present generation; of the dawn of universal peace after the destruction of the systems of militarism and oppression in impending Armageddon. I had touched the spot; eagerly she took the literature that showed the hope that her babes would grow up into a happier world, freed from the scourge of militarism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A.s Sarah Gamp might observe, “Humanity, high and low, is just folks.” No matter what the difference be in quality of dress, surroundings, interests and diversions, humans are humans and they want just what the first man failed to give them when the drama of ages began with tragedy—life, liberty, health, love, security and assurance of perpetual enjoyment of these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The more one really understands just how much like himself the other twenty thousand million humans who have lived are, the deeper is his appreciation of Jehovah, His plan and the satisfactory consummation.</span></p>

But for me, after subjecting my dollar to the larger and fully anticipated risk for the sake of the larger and fully anticipated return, to come running to the American taxpayer the moment the risk materializes and the return does not, demanding that he, the taxpayer, who has never invested a cent in Mexico and probably never will, shall send his son and his money southward to get my adventurous and deliberately hazarded dollar out of trouble, is obviously a performance that requires diplomatic description, lest the public should see it in its true light and call it by its correct and by no means agreeable name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Contentment on a Small Income </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Contributed)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6"> AM an ardent Bible Student and read </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> and believe it to be one of the best little papers published. In the issue of July 11 read a piece entitled, “The Short and Simple Annals of the Poor.” Believing that you desire to hear and print all sides of each subject at issue, I should like to see this contribution in your valuable paper, as I believe it would be helpful to many who are in perplexity of mind regarding present conditions in the industrial world today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I wish to state that I have been married for six years. My husband is employed as a common laborer in one of our leading industries, working nine hours a day at forty-two cents an hour, which is $3.78 a day. Sometimes they are slack and he is laid off; and then again when busy they work considerable overtime, which makes it about steady work the year around at $3.78, not over $4.00 a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have two lovely children and I want to say that we are a happy family. When we married we did not have a cent. We went in debt for three rooms of medium-priced furniture, which we have paid for. Later we bought a second-hand player piano for $350, and have it all paid for but $40.00. Two months ago we bought a second-hand Essex coach in fine condition, and expect to get it paid for, too. We borrowed the money from my brother to buy the car and will pay him back as we can spare, it, and as my husband understands a great deal about repairing machines it will not prove so expensive to run.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many of my friends wonder how we do manage, so I 'will try to tell you in my crude way, as I am not a writer. We rent three nice large rooms for $15.00 a month, and our gas, water and electric bills seldom run over meter rent, as we use these things very carefully. I am handy with the needle, so do all my own sewing and make my own hats. Our children are always dressed nice and kept clean, but as they do not have many clothes I must wash some out each day. I do not allow my children to wear their Sunday clothes or shoes for everyday wear. I buy our foodstuffs from the cash-and-carry stores, and it is remarkable how much you can save this way. We do not use expensive canned goods or tea or coffee, but have three wholesome meals a day, with some fruit but no knickknacks. Each Saturday night the children look forward to their sack of candy and bag of peanuts, which we purchase from the five-and-ten-cent store.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">People also complain about the high cost of babies. I made all my babies’ clothes and I did not go to a high-priced hospital either. They cost exactly $25.00 apiece, which was the doctor’s fee, and my mother took care of me and did the household chores.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course I do not have money for such foolishness as permanent waves, which, after all, are not so permanent. I curl my own hair. Neither do we spend money on trashy movingpicture shows, with their sensual love scenes, which are not fit for children to see. We have found out that the best things in life are free, such as our beautiful parks and open-air band concerts; and I enjoy the Bible lectures above all else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course there are a great many things which I should like to have (I think it is so with every normal human being), but I do not make myself unhappy because I can not possess them. Indeed we have learned that “godliness with contentment is great gain”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now in closing let me say that I think the workers should have more money, and the wealthy class are very selfish, and I know they could afford to pay more money if they would. But, dear friends, let us try to do the best we can and pray all the harder for the Lord to soon establish His kingdom on earth as it is in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Did Not Change His Vest</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font6">E HAVE a New Zealand paper containing a dispatch of 181 words reassuring us that Dean Barnett, of Hamilton, did not change his vest. It says by way of explanation: “The chasuble is not a pulpit vestment, and can be worn in the pulpit only when the pulpit is situated, within the sanctuary rails.” We laugh over this flapdoodle until we cry and ■wonder how anybody else can avoid doing the same thing. We expect this to be followed by a 200-word dispatch that the bishop has not had his trousers off for a week and that the archbishop has had on the same pair of socks since last spring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Good Health </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By H. W. Newcomb</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">G</span><span class="font6">OOD health is worth all it costs. No technical or scientific knowledge is necessary to understand it. Common sense -will tell yon that it is Truth. Truth is sometimes so simple that we ignore it. For instance, salt water is one of the best washes for the nose and throat, but because it lacks mystery people do not often use it, even when a doctor recommends it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The importance of diet to health is being better understood every day and can be readily seen in what follows. The way to correct errors in diet is plain. Food will take on new’ meaning and importance.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark86"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark87"></a>Your Home</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">Y</span><span class="font6">OUR body is your home—the only home you will have in this life. It pays to take care of this dwelling the best you know how until you must move out for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You are the manager and you can blame no one else if your home is not as you want it. Even if you inherited weakness, you can increase or decrease it, and if your weakness is greater and greater, you are responsible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Your home needs four things—heat, energy, repair, and elimination. Millions of little workers (cells) help keep your home running right and they are always </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">willing</span><span class="font6"> to do their part if they are furnished the proper materials to work with. Sixteen of the primary chemical elements are needed—carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur, sodium, iron, calcium, potassium, magnesium, manganese, silicon, chlorine, fluorine and iodine. The food we eat contains these elements in many different combinations, but if any are left out disease results.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark88"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark89"></a>Heat</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE body must be kept at 108.6 degrees Fahrenheit—--no more, no less. Clothing and housing have little to do with this temperature; the food we eat does. Many books and articles have been written on heat and energy units (calories) in food. The funny thing about it is that any one who eats food at all generally gets enough or too much of the heat-producing foods. They are the most common foods and form the largest part of our diet. You need not worry about getting enough heat units, but you should see that you are not getting too many.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The problem here is not to get enough but not to get too much, especially of the proteids which also contain much waste matter which must be thrown off.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Many people do not eat enough food containing repair materials. Would you expect a carpenter to build without lumber and nails? What would masons do without bricks and mortar! Would you horsewhip the plasterers</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">if they could not make the repairs without plaster! Then why expect more of the workers in your body whose duty it is to rebuild your physical home?

<p><span class="font13">L</span><span class="font6">IFE depends upon our ability to throw off waste materials of foods, dead cells, etc. If this 'waste remains in the body it attracts the germs of disease.

P. A., Guardians of Liberty, Ku Klux Klan. They are puritanical and attempt to regulate other people’s business by law, for instance, prohibition and Sunday observance. They profess the American principle of separation of Church and State, yet sneak of this country as Protestant. They look upon the public schools, supported by the taxes of Catholics as well as their own taxes, as belonging exclusively to themselves. They attempt to make the public schools Protestant by having a distinctly Protestant translation of the Bible read in class. They discriminate against Catholics in business. They have attempted to keep Catholics out of the United States through legislation directed at the European Catholic countries. They bring political and economic pressure to bear upon Catholics to contribute to distinctly Protestant undertakings, such as the Y. M. C. A. They seem to imply that Catholics are not Christians. They are intolerant of Protestants who become Catholics. They control the press of the country and do not give a reasonable amount of space to Catholics and Catholic activities. They look upon Catholics as socially inferior. They do not accept the whole Bible. They undermine the real authority of the Scripture. They deliberately use terms offensive to Catholics, such as Romanist and Papist. They have no fixed body of religious or moral belief. By ‘letting conscience be their guide’ they can reason conscience into making anything seem right. While remaining political constitutionalists they are religious anarchists; supposedly for freedom, but notoriously intolerant; by supporting divorce with right to remarry are really believers in legalized free love.</span></p>

They are clannish and stick together against Protestants in politics. When once in power they will not give‘‘heretics” a lookin. They talk “toleration” when Protestants are in a majority and “intolerance” when Catholics are in a majority. They are mostly wets and seek to nullify the Eighteenth Amendment. They hope to establish the Pope in Washington. They are seeking to get control of the public schools. They deny the validity of marriages between Protestants and Catholics, though legally contracted. They believe in the infallible authority of the Pope, even though he may be notoriously wicked or immoral. They are torn by a dual allegiance and can. not be loyal to America and to the Pope. Their church cellars are full of rifles. Their whole system is autocratic and fundamentally opposed to democracy and Americanism.

<p><span class="font4">. Catholic leaders are afraid to let Catholics mingle with non-Catholics, since they might be led away from the faith by the greater intelligence of the latter. Catholics furnish much more than their quota of insane. They are opposed to all progressive measures making for popular liberty and enlightenment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Morally, they tend to be deceitful and tricky and can not be trusted. They do not believe it wrong to lie to Protestants. They consider celibacy a higher state than marriage. Priests and nuns are often immoral. Catholic celibate priests are always urging large families for other people, even when the latter can not afford them. They take an unreasonable attitude against birth control. They allow Protestant Missions and Community Houses to support and help</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">their uncared-for young. Catholics furnish much more than their quota of criminals. Their confessional system makes them less scrupulous about wronging any one. Catholic institutions are. scandalously administered. They put the will of the Pope above conscience. They extol the sanctity of marriage in theory, but willingly annul marriages when it serves their purposes to do so. In Latin countries they contribute to illegitimacy through high marriage fees. They believe that the end justifies the means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Religiously, they are tawdry in their church decorations. They do not admit the direct approach of the believer to God. They are not allowed to read the Bible. They are idolaters and worship images and pictures. They believe that Protestants will go to hell. When they have been to mass on Sunday they can do anything they like the rest of the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Too many fake miracles, bleeding tongues, liquefactions, '‘showers fr&amp;m Saint Teresa,” etc. Catholicism encourages too nmeh formalism and “hocus-pocus”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Responsibility for World War</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">avid Lloyd George, speaking in a Welsh church in London, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Christian monarchs, statesmen, soldiers and ministers were responsible for the World War, not atheists, pagans, infidels and agnostics. Look at Europe today. After that last terrible lesson, there are more youths in the prime of vigor and life being taught and trained to kill each other than at any time since the foundations of the earth were laid. I say, as British minister of war when the World War broke out, that if all the churches of Christendom had said in 1914, ‘Halt! This murder must not begin,’ not a monarch nor minister in Christendom would have dared to start it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“You now have the declaration of one Chris-tain country to other Christian countries on the outlawry of war. They are all going to sign. And the same people who are going to sign will attend meetings of cabinets in America, Great Britain and throughout the World to determine how to spend many millions of dollars on the mechanism of slaughter.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">-—-To Heaven</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">“It is said the church is not responsible. I say it is. If the church does not contain a majority of the population, it contains a majority of the people who matter, who govern, who rule, who dominate everywhere. If they all stood together for the Prince of Peace, His cause would be irresistible in the world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ceilings </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Ray Knox</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6">F WE jump too high in a room we bump our heads on the ceiling. Our further progress in that direction is stopped. Just so with an ascending airplane. Something eventually halts its upward' course. It bumps into its ceiling, too. The ceiling that prevents our jumping out of a room is very real and tangible; but the ceiling that stops a flying machine from attaining greater height is a lack of these qualities. The propeller must have air to thrust against, just as a ship’s propeller must have water; and, since increasing altitude means decreasing density, an elevation is inevitably reached where the lessened efficiency of the mechanism just balances the downward pull of gravity. The machine has reached its ceiling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Orthodox religion, the nominal Christian church, bases its beliefs upon certain premises or doctrines and creates about itself a corresponding atmosphere. Down at doctrinal sealevel this atmosphere is very dense.- Thought wings its way about with great freedom of motion, though, like the airplane, with a vast expenditure of energy. But up above the Great Beyond beckons. Toward it orthodox reasoning boldly turns. Swiftly it mounts and is presently lost to sight of the watchers below. But though it meets its ceiling, the watchers do not know it. They are not encouraged to fly thought machines of their own, being taught to rely implicitly upon the word of their professional airmen. But of all these salaried flyers of orthodox thought-craft, no two return with tallying accounts, though all claim to have visited the very seat of the universe and to carry first-hand knowledge of the attributes of God. The resulting confusion should prove to the watchers that something is wrong; but they are notably a gullible race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The airplane brings back no answer to the question, “Is Mars inhabited?” nor does Orthodoxy’s excursion upward ever bring back any light to shed upon the obscure things of the spiritual realm. The airplane is of the earth, earthy. It is bound to the earth. It can not escape it. It draws its very life from the soil, and in failure finds itself dashed in pieces upon that very body from which it had drawn sustenance. Just so with nominal Christianity. It is of the earth, earthy. By the limitations of its owm finite atmosphere it is bound to the world. It can not escape it. Yet it finds flight not a</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">'difficult undertaking in the lower reaches where density is great enough for it to overcome the constant downward pull called Love of Power. But it never realizes that its very existence is dependent upon the credulity of duped mortals and that the farther away from this credulity it gets, the rarer does the atmosphere that sustains it become.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But what of this atmosphere? Why is it not of God and therefore a medium that stretches to infinity? Because Orthodoxy’s thoughts are the thoughts of men interested primarily in the doings of men. Its reasonings are the reasonings of finite minds not molded to fit God’s holy Word, but to which God’s Word has been itself made to conform. Its deductions are based upon the experiences and practices of men. Its weapons and its methods of warfare are absolutely and entirely carnal. It looks about it and sees a world full of saints and sinners. Some one, some time, must make some sort of disposition of this material. Orthodoxy says, “This is how </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font6"> would do it”; and signs God’s name to the certificate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Everything we know of aeronautics is based upon the physical properties of air. Therefore we can not fly beyond the range of that substance ; and, until another system is devised not dependent upon so limited a medium as is air, our ceiling will remain the very real and very effective quantity that it is, shutting us out from the Great Beyond quite as completely as though it were a mile-thick vault of steel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And just such a limitation is placed upon all who depend, for an understanding of God’s ultimate purpose, upon the theories of Orthodoxy. They can not understand, because their faculties seek to travel upon a medium that thins away to nothing and leaves the gulf unbridged. In the physical realm, no new system has as yet been proven practical for seeking out the mysteries of interplanetary space. But such is not the case in the spiritual realm. The Bible’s hidden meanings have been revealed and, instead of a mass of mysticisms and senseless contradictions, the Book of books stands forth as a unified entirety and discloses the divine plan as of a wonderfully symmetrical and complete design. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The exploring mind now finds no limits upon either the accuracy or the extent of its powers of flight. It has attained perfect freedom through sc.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">a more perfect understanding. The medium upon which it now rises is as all-pervading as are God’s own attributes of wisdom, justice, love and power, for a knowledge of things as they will be answers all questions as to the necessity of things’ being as they are.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">N </span><span class="font6">THE southern part of Idaho where many years ago nothing grew except sagebrush, and the only inhabitants were coyotes and jackrabbits, there, is now a fertile land known as the Boise Valley. Here is God’s promise indeed fulfilled, that the desert shall blossom as the rose. The valley consists of about a million acres and is bounded on the east by the Sawtooth. Mountains and on the south by the Owyhee Mountains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Government considers that forty acres irrigated and well tended will produce as much, as a quarter section under dry-fanning methods. On the Boise River in the mountains above the valley is the famous Arrowrock Dam, concrete insurance of abundance of water each year for irrigation, which is crop insurance for our fanners. Arrowrock Dam is the highest .in the world, being 258 feet above foundations. It is 1100 feet long on the crest and is built on </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">curve for additional safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The climate of this valley has much to do with the health, contentment and general prosperity of its people. The winters are just severe enough to make us appreciate spring with its bright sunshine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The summers are delightful, with cool refreshing nights. Severe storms and damaging winds are things unknown. Those who have always lived here have no idea what a cyclone is like.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are no large cities, but several industrious towns. Boise, which is the capital of the state, is a beautiful town of about 25,000 inhabitants. This is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">most delightful, place to live, with its wonderful climate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nampa, which is the hub of the valley, is a modern, fast-growing town of about 10,000 population. Here is situated the second largest condensery in the world, and also two large creameries. There are about 70,000 pounds of milk received at this condensery daily. From this valley last year were shipped 547 carloads of fancy butter and canned milk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is an ideal place for dairying on account of the mild winters and fine blue-grass pastures. There is also an abundance of alfalfa hay, which is the supreme feed for dairy cattle. The industrious bees plunder the alfalfa fields and orchards and last year were shipped 15 cars of honey which is unexcelled anywhere. This is truly a land flowing with milk and honey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Small grains and certified seeds yield good returns here by planting on ground which has been enriched by alfalfa. By rotating with alfalfa the ground is kept enriched without any fertilizer. Last year there were 1748 cars of grains and seeds shipped out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is an ideal place for poultry-raising of all kinds. Of late years it has been found that the turkey thrives very well. Last year there were 277 cars of dressed poultry and eggs shipped from here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The vegetables grown are unexcelled anywhere. The famous Idaho spud is grown here, and no doubt many of our eastern readers have eaten some of these. They are often sold in New York city wrapped separately in paper. Of potatoes last year there were shipped 1144 cars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Head lettuce of the finest quality is also growm commercially here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The principal fruit crop is apples, and all of the standard varieties are grown to perfection. They arc shipped in boxes and baskets to all parts of the United States and-to many foreign countries. The Idaho Delicious apple is the standard of quality wherever it. is grown. Of apples last year there were shipped 6189 cars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The famous Idaho prune comes next in importance and is grown very successfully. Last year there were 1665 cars shipped. Other fruits grown successfully are apricot, pears, cherries, peaches and small berries of all kinds.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">A Visit to Windsor Castle </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By E. Louise Hamilton</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE usual residence of the British sovereigns is Windsor- Castle, one of the largest and most magnificent royal palaces in the world. The castle is on the Thames, about twenty-one miles west of London, and has been a favorite residence of the British sovereigns since the days of William the Conqueror.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The original royal palace, where the Saxon kings lived before the Conquest, was about two miles distant from the present one, which was built by William on a site purchased -from the monks of 'Westminster Abbey, and added to by some of the Plantagenets. During the reign of Edward III the castle was torn down and rebuilt by the Bishop of Winchester. The new castle received various additions by order of succeeding monarchs until the time of Queen Victoria, who brought it to its present state of beauty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The town of Windsor is said to have a population of 34,000, and practically forms one town with Eton, from which it is separated only by the Thames. Eton is the site of the famous college of the same name, the most aristocratic school in England, with an attendance of about 1,000 students. These students are the sons of the gentry and the nobility; and it is said that so numerous are the applicants that usually the names are entered at birth, to insure admittance at the age of twelve or fourteen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Windsor is a quaint old town with narrow, irregular streets paved with cobblestones. Many of the buildings are historical, especially those in the vicinity of the castle. From the castle A wall an old inn. The Red Lion, is pointed out, where tradition asserts that Henry VIII was prone to spend an evening, dressed like a working man, in order to hear what the townsmen who congregated there might have to say about him and his doings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is said also that a butcher whose home was in the immediate vicinity was so indiscreet as to criticize publicly Henry’s domestic infelicities; and that the king had him hanged from the castle tower in full sight of his weeping family, as a forceful reminder of the old adage, “The king can do no wrong!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Stoke Pogis, where the poet Gray lies buried in the “country’' churchyard”, is about twelve miles from Windsor. It is said that the curfew which tolled “the knell of parting day” was rung from the tower in Windsor Castle, and sounded out SAveetly over the adjacent countryside, reaching even to Stoke Pogis. Ascot, famous for its races, is also in the vicinity of Windsor; and during the racing season the royal family come to the. castle in order to enjoy the races in the nearby toAvn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As the train from London approaches Windsor the quiet beauty of the Thames appeals to every artistic nature. Soon the cold gray stone walls of the castle appear above the tops of the trees fringing the river. In a few minutes after the station has been reached the visitor is at the castle gate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The castles of Europe Avere constructed to serve as forts, and everything about them is suggestive of cruelty and oppression. In the days of yore the cold gray stone walls were covered with tapestry, velvet hangings, etc., so as to be more or less comfortable for the lords and ladies who frequented them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Like all medieval castles, Windsor consists of a pile of buildings, quadrangles, terraces, open courts, etc., occupying in all twelve acres, and extending along the crest of an eminence rising over forty feet above the Thames. Beyond this Little Park, as it is called, is the Great Park, adjoining Windsor Forest, the whole occupying an area of 13,000 acres, fifty-six miles in circumference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The walls of the castle are strong, as if originally designed to withstand the attacks of an army. From the battlements the tower, eightyfeet, in height, a charming view of Eton and the surrounding country may be had. On entering from the town the first building one passes on the left is the prison. A long flight of rickety old stairs leads to the belfry, where the vrisitor is shoAvn the great works of the clock the bells of AA’hich sound the hour. The clockworks are made of iron Avhieh does not rust, and are said to be the Avorkmanship of a blacksmith named John Davies, Avho lived during the reign of Charles II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The blacksmith and Sir Christopher Wren, the great architect of St. Paul’s Cathedral, disagreed as to the clockworks; and as a result DaAn.es never disclosed the secret of making rustless iron. The clock is Avound every thirty hours by means of a huge iron key. The weights are attached to rope cables, and are three in nmnber. The clock strikes the quarter hours, as well as the hours. Every three hours a hymn tune is played on an instrument connected to the clock by means of heavy wires. One of the bells is said to have been brought from Sebastopol.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The ground floor of the tower is the place where prisoners were kept in the olden days of &quot;Merrie England”. In one corner is the remains of the tiny cell in which Anne Boleyn was confined for forty-eight hours prior to her beheading in 1536. There are secret passages leading from the dungeons, through which favored prisoners could come and go without being detected. In one corner of the underground floor is a pair of stocks, by which punishment was inflicted for divers offenses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Much of the inside of this tower was built in the fourteenth century. The original tower was merely a circular wall with a roof, and sheltered the castle guard. The wood used inside of the tower is of some unknown species and is never infested with insects. Even spiders will not spin their webs there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the time of our visit the church within the castle walls was undergoing repairs, and was therefore not open to visitors. The adjoining-little chapel of St. George is well worth a visit. On the right side of the chapel, and nearer the altar than are the ordinary pews, are the seats occupied by the king and the queen when they are present at the services. Except for the canopy above them., these seats are not unusual in appearance. On the opposite side of the chapel is an exquisitely carved pulpit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Leaving the chapel we pass out into a corridor, at the left end of which is a small alcove containing a striking piece of sculpture representing the death of Queen Charlotte, wife of George III, who died in childbirth. The background of the monument represents an open window through which an angel is floating, with arm uplifted as if in the act of blessing the little company of mourners kneeling around the bier in the foreground. On either side of the angel kneels another angel, the one at the right holding a babe, the one at the left with hands folded. At the feet of the angels is the extended form of Queen Charlotte, her right arm drooping over the side of the bier, with the fingers extending below the pall, which covers the entire figure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the head is the figure of a veiled mourner whose attitude represents abject grief. At the feet is the figure of another mourner. In front of them, but at a lower level, are two other women, also heavily veiled. The attitude of the four is expressive of intense grief. Each figure is a study in itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The beauty of the monument is beyond words to describe. The open window through which the death angel and his companions have come is draped with curtains and lambrequin, so cut in the marble as to appear like cloth. It is hard to realize that what seem to be soft folds of clinging material are lines cut in solid marble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the other end of the corridor, and opposite the entrance of the chapel, is an oil painting representing the Last Supper. The picture is worthy of a better position. The expression of each face in the group is remarkable, that of Judas being almost fiendish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the time of our visit the Ascot races were on, and the royal family was “in residence” in the state apartments of the castle proper. As no visitors are permitted to enter the royal residence during the presence of the king or his family, we were not able to seo the state apartments. We strolled about the grounds, which are guarded by sentinels in their sentryboxes. The red coats and the large black headcoverings, familiarly known as “busbies”, aroused our curiosity; and the mischievous member of our party could not restrain the desire to tease the sentinels whom he passed on our way to the gate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After leaving the castle grounds, we walked through the quaint old town, with its streets paved with cobblestones, down to the home of the dear friends who had made our visit so de-■ lightful. There -we spent a pleasant hour or so in fellowship, listening to verbal sketches of life in different European countries, drawn by one well able to entertain along this line. Then, we went to the railway station for our return trip to London. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When we reached the station we found crowds gathering from the Ascot races. Among these were several well-known members of the British aristocracy, who rode in from the races in a tallyho coach. When the train pulled in, the entire party boarded it; and in a short time we found ourselves in Paddington Station. Thus ended a delightful trip to Windsor Castle.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark100"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark101"></a>Liberty </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Charles E. Guiver (London)</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HERE is in the language no word more abused than “liberty”. Politicians have found it a useful catchword in their claims to safeguard the interests of the people. Its sanction has been sought, when refractory members of society have acted contrary to the will of the majority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Liberty has been the boast of the free, the hope of the oppressed; and some have been ignorant of their privileges. Liberty has covered a multitude of sins; but, unlike love, it has been used for self and not for others, providing a fair mask for evil schemes. It has been truly said that “words are counters to the wise but money to the fool”.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark102"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark103"></a>Natural Rights &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">L</span><span class="font6">IBERTY is defined as being the unre</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">strained enjoyment of certain rights. Many have wanted to make it the doing as one pleases. Rights are of various kinds: there are legal rights and natural rights. Natural rights are those that belong to us by virtue of possessing life, and appertain to the opportunity of obtaining the things that are necessary, and also of ministering to one’s own 'welfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Every one has the right to the gifts of nature, whether he be king or peasant, ruler or ruled. The opportunity to enjoy sunshine, air, food and clothing should be open to all. Legal rights are those which are ours because we are members of society, and refer to protection and security, and in some cases to a voice as to who shall govern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All like to have their own way; and this is allowable unless our actions affect the interests of others. So complicated is the world today that there is scarcely a word or an action but that affects some one else. Freedom is desired by all, but man is bound: bound by the' customs, the popular thought and the interests of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many who think themselves free do not realize that they are slaves to self, to the powers of this world and to him who rules it;whether consciously or unconsciously does not alter the fact. However loud they may proclaim their liberty, they can not free themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If true liberty is the unrestrained enjoyment of certain natural rights, then few are free. The great cities of the world are crowded with people who are suffering for lack of fresh air, sunshine, good food, proper shelter, and clothing. Many can not, even if they wished, get these essentials for a happy life.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark104"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark105"></a>Rights of the Mind</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HERE are other things which it is generally held belong to all: the right to worship God in a way conscience dictates; the right to believe and teach the things which are true, and the right to investigate for oneself: to try the spirits and to hold fast that which is good. Yet how shackled with error and superstition are the majority of our fellows! How few even try to ascertain what is right concerning God, and what claims, if any, He has upon them!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people are caught and held in bondage, and are forced to bow before a hideous manmade idol, the unholy trinity which controls their work, their social outlook, and their religious life. The leaders of the world, like Nebuchadnezzar of old, demand the obeisance of all the people to this modern Baal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the name of liberty and democracy this colossal forgery has been imposed on the masses. Cast, in the mold of 'divine right of the rulers’, held in position by the claim of 'divine right of the clergy’, and supported on the pedestal of accumulated wealth, it stands out as an unexampled case of human arrogance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Free? It is mockery to speak of it! Men are bound with chains more compelling than if of iron. They are led forth like galley-slaves to serve the interests of their masters, and, like them, are not released until set free by death; when, wearied by continuous unnatural effort, they let go and disappear, being laid to rest where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Will this continue for ever? Is there no one wise enough and strong enough to break the shackles and set the prisoners free ? Yes! For the great time clock has struck, the hour of deliverance is here and the Emancipator is ready.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people are to be led forth into the liberties and blessings of the kingdom of God. The people must wait a little before these blessings come, for the oppressors must first be vanquished. The idol -which blocks the path to freedom must be destroyed.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark106"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark107"></a>The Free</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">LTHOUGH it is true that all are more or less in bondage to the powers of this world, yet in God’s sight there is a certain class who are free. Jesus said, ‘If the Son make you free, ye are free indeed.’ All are slaves to selfishness, sin and Satan: and the Master has opened a. way whereby we may be free. Not that we can be perfect, but we can have a right spirit in our hearts and serve God instead of serving Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who come to God through Christ, devoting themselves to do His will, are received into the family of God and as sons have rights and privileges which others have not, just as a son in an earthly house has rights and privileges which the servants and outsiders have not. They are the only ones who have a proper right to come to God as their Father. These, and no others, have the right to speak fot God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are many who have passed through an ordination and a human laying-on of hands who have no more right to take the Word of God into their mouth to preach than the most ignorant idol-worshiper in heathendom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is but one true ordination. It is the anointing of the holy spirit of God, and all receiving this anointing have the right to preach. “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach.”—Isaiah 61:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some have criticized the Bible Students because they dare to preach without a particular brand of man-arranged ordination. The Christian is free: free to bear to others the good news of the kingdom, free in God’s sight to exercise the rights which belong to him by virtue of the fact that he is a son of God,</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">This so aroused the indignation of the rulers that they had Peter and John arrested and brought before the chief council. Then these men testified to the leaders that the great work had been done by the very One -whom they had crucified, but whom God had raised from the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The facts could not be disputed. “That indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem, and we can not deny it,” they said. Ah, that was the pinch: they ‘could not deny it’. They would if they could. They would rather have the people ignorant of the truth, so long as their position was maintained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What did they do but call the apostles before them and command them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. The people had a right to know the truth. These leaders, financial, political and religious, would keep it from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The apostles knew their mission, realized their responsibility, and determined to exercise their God-given rights as His representatives. Their answer is our answer to all who would oppose the truth today. “Judge ye whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken, unto you more than unto God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They went home, and in the company of the other Christians prayed to God that He would help them “that with all boldness they might speak his word”. The Lord’s people have special rights: and by the law of God, which is greater than the law of man, they have liberty to proclaim the truth of God’s kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Provision for Reconciliation</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">[Broadcast from Station WBBR, New York, by Judge Butherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">O</span><span class="font6">N THIS occasion we will examine the evidence concerning the provision made for man’s reconciliation to God. Selfishness has so long been magnified before the mind of man that it is almost impossible for the people to understand that any other motive prompts one’s actions than that of selfishness. Many have gone to the point of charging Jehovah with selfishness. The truth is that the motive of God in every instance is that of unselfishness and therefore He is love. God alone has made provision for the reconciliation of man to Himself. Therefore love provides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God has been grossly misrepresented by the clergy. If this statement is true, then that alone is proof conclusive that the clergy do not in fact represent God and Christ but do represent God’s enemy, the Devil. Let it be conceded that the clergy have been conscientious in the positions taken by them and in the 'doctrines they have taught. Yet that in no wise proves them to be right. The conscience is not a safe guide unless that conscience has been educated and operates in harmony with the Word of God. If the Bible plainly proves that the doctrines the clergy teach are -wrong and their course of action is wrong, then the most that can be said in extenuation of their wrongful teachings and their wrongful course of action is that they have been mislead by the evil and seductive influence of Satan, the enemy of God. If the doctrines taught and the course taken by the clergy differ from that which is declared in the Word of God, then the clergy are in no wise safe guides for the people and should no longer be followed by the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are divers and numerous systems of religion which are called Christian. The course of action taken by their leaders, the clergy, is that same course taken by the world. These men attempt to regulate the affairs of the governments, dabble in polities, and aid in the oppression of the people. The doctrines taught by these various religious leaders differ materially. They are inconsistent with each other and with themselves, and all are in. contravention of the Word of God. Because of the inconsistency of their teachings their doctrines cause great confusion in the minds of the people. That is further evidence that such doctrines do not represent the truth. &quot;God is not the author of confusion.” His Word is truth. (1 Corinthians 14: 33; John 17:17) Satan, the enemy of God and of the truth, is the author of confusion. But Satan is subtle, deceptive and the father of lies. (John 8: 44) Those who teach his doctrines willingly are his children. His purpose is to confuse the people, to blind their minds, and to keep them away from an accurate knowledge of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Reconciliation of mankind to God means the salvation of those -who are reconciled. There could be only one way for the reconciliation of man to God. That way must be God’s way and therefore the true way. (Isaiah 55:8) Because of the divers and numerous and conflicting doctrines taught by the clergy concerning the reconciliation and salvation of man, and because of the inconsistency of those doctrines and the inconsistency of the course of action taken by their teachers, millions of honest men have been turned away from God and from the Bible. That result is exactly -what Satan has desired to accomplish. He has fairly well succeeded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One part of the organization called Christianity through its clergy teaches that God condemned Adam to hell, and that hell means the place of torment, eternal in duration, and that therefore Adam is without hope of escaping therefrom; that God foreordained that the major portion of mankind must spend eternity in such.hell while the minor portion shall be taken to heaven, and that ■whether either of these desire one or the other. Their doctrine is that the earth is a breeding-place for humankind and that the eternal destiny of each one is foreordained and fixed at or before birth and that the eternal state of such is entered upon at death. Such doctrine is unreasonable because according thereto man is given no opportunity to choose one or the other place of existence. Worst of all, and as another evidence of its falsity, the doctrine stamps Jehovah God as a wicked fiend who would take delight in the endless torture of the creature. Satan the Devil is the one who desires to fix that conclusion in the mind of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another part of the organization called Christian through its clergy teaches that all men were sentenced to eternal torment but that free grace is offered to all and that if man will believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God he may be saved ’because Jesus has intervened in behalf of those who do believe and pleads with Jehovah for their forgiveness. That doctrine makes Jehovah appear as a monstrous fiend who would torment unfortunate creatures for ever but who would yield to the pleadings of Jesus and grant man relief upon certain conditions. It makes Jesus appear to be the only friend of man and dishonors God. It misleads man to believe that by merely acknowledging that Jesus is the Son of God and then uniting himself with some church system, he may be saved, which is wholly untrue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another part of the organization called Christian through its teachers, the clergy, tells the people that all men were condemned to eternal torment by the decree of God against Adam; that Jesus came to earth and by His course of action in life set a righteous example before man, which example, if followed by man, will bring salvation and enable man to lift himself out of degradation. Such doctrine is inconsistent and wrong because it nullifies the righteous judgment of God, ignores the only basis for reconciliation and leads man to believe that it is possible by his own efforts to bring about his reconciliation with God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another portion of the organization called Christendom or Christian through its clergy teaches that man never fell at all and. never was condemned by Jehovah; that there never was any need for the sacrifice of Jesus; that the death of Jesus is of no A wall to mankind; and that all men can be saved by their own efforts. Such doctrine is untrue because it repudiates the Word of God, denies Jesus Christ, denies the value of His sacrifice, and denies the divine way for the reconciliation of man to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All these various divisions or portions of so-called organized Christianity unite in the'claim that each and every one of them represents God and Christ, on earth and speaks with authority concerning the salvation of the human race. They all misrepresent God and His Word and bring the people into confusion and doubt. The result is that for some time, in the language of the Scripture, there is ‘a famine in the land for the hearing of the Word of God’. —Amos 8:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This does not mean that true Christianity is in any manner wrong or confusing. On the contrary, true Christianity means the plain and true teachings of God’s Word concerning His Christ. By and through Jesus God planted Christianity as a pure and noble vine. Christ is represented as being the true vine, and His faithful followers the true branches. (John 15: 1-8) The apostles and early followers of Christ Jesus continued in purity in the teachings of the truth. After the apostles had passed away from the stage of earthly activity ambitious men yielded to the seductive influence of Satan, and ere long Christianity so called became a strange and degenerate vine. It mixed the errors of paganism and of the politics of the Devil’s organization with the church and has so continued since. At the present time the organized system called Christendom or Christianity is merely a political and social organization that has entirely turned away from God. and the truth. This very condition God foretold through His prophet. “Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me ?”—Jeremiah 2: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">'What the people with honest minds must now do is to diligently seek the truth as it is set forth in the Word of God. Thus doing they will understand and appreciate the goodness of God and His gracious provision for the reconciliation. of man to Himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let the student bear in mind that the divine record truthfully states that “God is love”. (1 John 4:8) That does not merely mean that God is kind, compassionate and merciful to the erring one. It means much more than that. Love is synonymous with complete unselfishness. Perfect love is the perfect expression of unselfishness. That means that everything God has done or does is entirely free from selfishness. He does nothing for man with the expectation of receiving something in return to His benefit. It is impossible for man to bring any benefit to Jehovah. He possesses everything that is good. What He does for His creatures is for the good of those creatures. Therefore everything God does for man is done unselfishly and He is moved so to do by love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God is just. (Psalm 89:14) His law is perfect and right. (Psalm 19: 7, 8) He is the very habitation of justice. (Jeremiah 50:7) He is the true, just and righteous God. (Isaiah 45: 21) Whatever He does is exactly right. He told Adam in advance what would be the penalty for a violation of His law. (Genesis 3:17) The wilful violation of that law justly required punishment to be inflicted as God had announced it. Any other course would have proven Jehovah unreliable and was therefore impossible. The penalty for the violation of God’s law required the death of the perfect man. Justice would make it impossible for God to reverse that judgment. It must stand. Between the time that the judgment of death was entered and the time it was fully enforced against Adam all of Adam’s children were born, and born without the right to life because born in sin and shapen in iniquity. (Psalm 51:5) All of his children being born sinners, justice would require that in due time all such should die. ■—Romans 5:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But would it be just that Adam and his children or any of them should exist for ever in a state of conscious torment? Such punishment would be neither legal nor just. The law of God states that death is the penalty. Death means the absence of life. If the punishment to be inflicted was then made torment in a conscious state, and that eternally, such punishment would be contrary to the law of God and would prove Him to be unjust. Justice means that’ which is right. Could it be right to torment any creature for ever? Could any good result from it? Would it be any indication of love on the part of the one who inflicted the torment? Certainly these questions must be answered in the negative. Torture is repulsive even to imperfect men. Only a selfish, hard, cruel and wicked one could inflict conscious eternal torment upon another. In order that the creature might be consciously tormented for ever such creature must of necessity exist for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Satan the Devil told the first lie, when he said to Eve: ‘Ye shall surely not die.’ The theory of eternal torment in hell is the outgrowth of that Satanic lie; and the doctrine of inherent immortality and the doctrine of eternal torment are grossly false, cruel and unjust. These doctrines originated with the Devil. They have long been taught by his representatives. (John 8:44) They have brought reproach upon the good name of Jehovah God. Satan the Devil is responsible therefor. The clergy have been his instruments freely used to instill these false doctrines into the minds of men. Whether the clergy have willingly done so or not does not alter the fact. If they have now learned that they are wrong they should be eager to get that false thought out of the minds of the people. They do not take such course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Because of this wicked reproach upon the name of Jehovah God many men and women have refused to hear anything about the Word of God. The basic doctrines of inherent immortality and eternal torment, as taught by the clergy, being wrong, all their theories of reconciliation are also wrong. The great mass of the people have lost confidence in the clergy and at the same time have turned away from the Lord. When these people know the truth they will have less confidence in the clergy and will turn to the Lord God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If man is to be reconciled to God the initiative must be taken by the Lord God Himself. The theory taught by some of the clergy, that Jesus, the Son of God, has been appealing- to the Father for mercy and forbearance toward sinners, is entirely wrong. If God should yield to the appeals of Jesus in behalf of sinners' and for that reason forgive sinners, such would be a violation of justice. It would be a denial of His own judgment and would sIioav His change without any reason, and such is impossible. (Malachi 3:6) God does exercise compassion and mercy toAvard the sinner, but this He does consistent with justice; and He does so only after the requirements of justice are fully met.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Had God’s actions toward men ceased upon the satisfaction of justice, then in time all mankind must for ever perish. To save men from perishing God exercised Himself in behalf of man and in strict harmony with justice. In doing so He gave the greatest exhibition of unselfishness that ever was given or ever can be given. God took the initiative looking to man’s reconciliation, and He did so because He is love. Love made the provision, and this is proven by the divine record which reads: “For God so loved the Avorld, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Foi- God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.”—John 3:16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This scripture proves that the human race was headed not for eternal torment, as the cler-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gy</span><span class="font6"> have told the people, hut that they were on the way to everlasting destruction. To perish means to go out of existence completely. God, in the exercise of His loving-kindness, and exercising it in strict accord with justice, prevented the eternal destruction of mankind and has made it possible for all men to have an opportunity for life. Therefore it is written: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” (John 17:3) It is the purpose of God to give man a knowledge of what He has done. To this end it is wwitten: “God . . . will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.”-......1 Timothy</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">2:3-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These scriptures prove that Jehovah God is the savior of men; that it is His plan of salvation and reconciliation that is being worked out for man’s benefit; that love makes this provision for man; that His be loved Son Jesus is the great instrument God is using to accomplish His purpose; that man must be brought to an accurate knowledge of the truth in order to benefit by these gracious provisions; and that in God’s due time the testimony of the truth must be given to all men. Be it known that now is the time when God is beginning to open the gates of truth for the benefit of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These 'words are here spoken not in an attempt to express man’s wisdom but solely to bear -witness to the love of God and to aid the people to acquire some knowledge of His gracious provisions for the reconciliation of man to Himself. It follows then that man must exercise his God-given faculties in acquiring such knowledge.. He must apply his mind to an understanding of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If God could not reverse His own judgment against Adam and forgive the sinner, then how is it possible to exercise love in harmony with justice and provide a way for man to live? Briefly the answer is, that God has made provision for the willing substitution of another in death in the place and stead of Adam, to the end that Adam and all of his offspring might have an opportunity to live. To understand and appreciate the way that leads to reconciliation and life it is necessary to consider step by step God’s gracious provision therefor. St every step the student will mark the manifestation of divine love.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark110"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark111"></a>Basis for Reconciliation</span></h4>
<div><img src="g_E_19281017_files/g_E_19281017-13.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">The basis for sin atonement and the bringing of man back into harmony with God is a sacrifice which provides a covering for sin and the opening of the way for man’s reconciliation to God. From first to last this is made emphatic in the Scriptures. It began to be foreshadowed at Eden. When Adam and his wife had committed the great sin they realized their nakedness of being and therefore their unworthiness to appear before their great Creator. They attempted to hide their nakedness and to hide themselves. In answer to a question Adam said: “I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.” The decree or judgment of Jehovah was pronounced against Adam and Eve. Approximately at that time, but evidently after out of Eden, God provided coverings for them, as it is written: “Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.”—Genesis 3: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was necessary for some life to be sacrificed in order to provide the covering for Adam and his wife. God had a purpose in so doing beyond merely their covering at that time. In the light that God has caused to shine upon His Word in these latter days it is seen that God at the beginning indicated the method He would employ by which He would bring man back into harmony with Himself. The sin of man would be covered, but a.t the cost of life. The sin of man and the covering provided were associated together from the beginning. Thus it was foreshadowed that in due time God would provide a covering for man’s sin that would purge array his guilt. (Hebrew’s 9:14) Adam and Eve did not understand the significance of it. But God here began to manifest His loving-kindness toward the children of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From Eden to the flood only a very few sought after God. But those who did seemed to recognize the necessity of a sacrifice in order to have God’s approval. It seems quite clear that none of these understood th© full significance of the sacrifice but that such animals sacrificed pointed to the fact that God in His own good way would provide for man’s reconciliation, Such sacrifice was no part of a purpose ofi appeasing God’s wrath, as many have seemed to think’, but to signify man’s unworthiness to approach God and to foreshadow God's appointed way to cover man’s sins and God’s appointed way for reconciling man to Himself. God there began to lead and continued to tenderly lead and teach those who desired to be led to a knowledge of His plan of salvation. Abraham is counted a friend of God because of his great faith in God. To Abraham God gave the most pointed picture of sacrifice ever given aside from the true sacrifice, which Abraham’s son Isaac foreshadowed.—Genesis 22:1-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then God chose the Israelites as a people for Himself, and with that people He made many pictures teaching the basis for the reconciliation of man to Himself. In Egypt a lamb without spot or blemish was slain and its blood sprinkled over the door of every family of Israel, and it served as a shield and protection of the Israelites from death. Thus 'was foreshadowed the greater sacrifice that would provide for mankind a shield from the destructive influence of sin. In the wilderness God caused the tabernacle to be constructed and once each year certain animals to be sacrificed in connection therewith and the blood of such animals to be sprinkled upon the mercy seat in the most holy of the tabernacle. This was for the cleansing of the nation of Israel from sin, and foreshadowed that there would be a living sacrifice to make atonement for the sin of man. These yearly sacrifices were made according to the provision of the law covenant, and it is expressly written that the law covenant served as a teacher to lead the people to the One whose shed blood would open the way for reconciliation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Were these animals sacrificed for the pleasure and gratification of Jehovah God and to appease His wrath, as some of the clergy have claimed? The Lord through His Word says, No. “Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not rocpiired.” (Psalm 40: 6) “In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.”—Heb. 10: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why then were these animals sacrificed? It was an expression of God’s loving-kindness for man, teaching man how He would in due time open the way for man’s complete reconciliation and that the basis for such reconciliation would be the sacrifice of life. God has proceeded to gradually and gently teach and lead men, knowing that when men come to know Him and His good purposes toward them they will love and obey Him. Satan, being aware of this fact, has ever sought to keep men in the dark concerning God’s loving-kindness toward man. (2 Corinthians 4:4) In due time the entire drama will work out to the complete destruction of the wicked one and to the eternal glory of God. God’s pleasure was not in the sacrifice of these animals, but it was His pleasure to enable man to appreciate why a sacrifice was necessary to open the way for reconciliation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The time came when God through His prophet made a definite promise that He would redeem man from death and ransom him from the power of the grave. He therefore caused His prophet to write: “I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; 0 grave, I will be thy destruction.” (Hosea 13:14) The word here rendered “ransom” means to. release or deliver from. The grave or condition of death held man in its clutches, but the promise of God as here recorded is that at some time and in His own good way He would release man from death and the power of the grave. The malting of the promise is a complete guarantee that in God’s due time it must be fulfilled and redemption and release be accomplished.—Isaiah 55:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But how’ would this promise be fulfilled? What would be required to ransom man from the power of the grave and redeem him from, death? How could this be accomplished consistently with justice? There could be no deviation from God’s law without the violation of justice. A perfect human life the law required as a penalty for sin. This was emphasized in God's statement of the law requiring a life for a life. (Deuteronomy 19:21) The life of dumb animals could not be substituted for human life, and therefore there could be no redemptive value in the sacrifice of dumb animals. It is manifest that the sacrifice of such animals merely foreshadowed the sacrifice of a life but did not foreshadow the nature of the one who must be the real sacrifice. The clear inference must be drawn from the language used by God’s prophet that the redemptive price required must be that of a perfect human life. This inference is supported by the Word of the Lord which reads: “A brother can none of them re-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">'deem, he can not give unto God a ransom for himself: so costly is the redemption of their soul, that it faileth unto times age-abiding.”— Psalm 49: 7, 8, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All men being the offspring of Adam, and being therefore imperfect, no one man could provide a covering for his own sins nor could he give the price of the covering for the sins of his brother. This is conclusive proof that man could not take the initiative toward reconciliation. Jehovah God alone must make the necessary provision, and unless God in the exercise of Ills loving-kindness toward men did make the necessary provision all men in time must perish. Therefore it is written that God so loved mankind, that is to say, He was so unselfishly disposed toward men, that He sent His beloved Son Jesus into the world that the peoples of the world might not perish but that they might be saved from everlasting destruction. (John 3:16,17) When Jesus came to earth He said that He came to give His life a ransom for man that man might have life. (Matthew 20:23; John 10:10) After Jesus, the Son of God, died upon the cross and God had raised Him up out of death, Paul by the authority of <sup>1</sup> God wrote concerning Jesus Christ: “In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace.”—Ephesians 1: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The man who reasons logically proceeds in this manner: Seeing that the lav<sup>7</sup> of God required the life of a perfect man, the penalty for sin, and that Adam as a perfect man died because thereof; and seeing further that the redemptive or ransom price for man must be that of a perfect human life substituted in death for Adam, therefore the question: How could Jesus give His life as a ransom for mankind unless Jesus &quot;was only a perfect man -when on the earth? Furthermore, since the Scriptures show that God had no pleasure in the sacrifice of ’dumb animals, because the life thereof was less than that of a perfect man and could not provide the ransom price, would it not be equally true that if the life of Jesus was greater than that of a perfect man His life sacrificed would not meet the requirements of the law? How then could God have pleasure in His sacrifice, and how could His sacrifice be accepted as a basis for reconciliation if Jesus was greater than the perfect man Adam?</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark112"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark113"></a>The Trinity</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">ARLY in the Christian era the Devil got in his work for the purpose of confusing men concerning these very questions. The clergy have at all times posed as the representatives of God on earth. Satan overreached the minds of these clergymen and injected into their minds doctrines, which doctrines the clergy have taught the people concerning Jesus and His sacrifice, and these doctrines have brought great confusion. The apostles taught the truth, but it was not long after their death until the Devil found some clergyman wise in his own conceit who thought he could teach more than the inspired apostles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The doctrine of the trinity was first introduced into the Christian church, by a clergyman of Antioch named Theophilus. The doctrine so taught by that clergyman, and which since has been followed by others, is, in brief, that there are three gods in one, to wit, God the Father, God the Son, -and God the Holy Ghost, all three equal in power, substance and eternity. The creed of the Church of England puts it in these words: “There is but one living and true God, . . . and in unity of this Godhead there be three persons of one substance, power and eternity; the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A council of the clergy was held at Nice, in 325 A. D.,- which council confirmed the doctrine of the trinity; and later a similar council at Constantinople, by confirming the divinity of the Holy Ghost and the unity of God, declared the doctrine of the trinity in unity to be the doctrine of the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The clergy have ever held to this senseless, God-dishonoring doctrine. To aid his agents to keep this doctrine before their mind the Devil must have some visible object symbolizing it. The mystic triangle was adopted as a symbol, which may be found in the tombs of those who ■were buried contemporaneously therewith. Also there was an attempt to prove it 'by three heads or faces on one neck, the eyes becoming a part of each individual face. Also a combination of the triangle and circle, and sometimes the trefoil, was used for the same purpose. If you ask a clergyman what is meant by the trinity he says: “That is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> mystery.” He does not know, and no one else knows, because it is false.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Never ■was there a more deceptive doctrine advanced than 'that of the trinity. It could have originated only in the one mind, and that the mind of Satan the Devil. The purpose was and is to produce confusion in the mind of man and to destroy the true philosophy of the great ransom sacrifice. If Jesus when on earth was God He was more than a perfect man and therefore could not become an exact corresponding price for the redemption of men. Therefore it logically follows that the shed blood of Jesus would form no basis for the reconciliation of man to God. If Jesus was one part of the trinity, then it -would be impossible for the trinity or any part of it to furnish the redemptive price for a perfect man, because there could be no exact correspondency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Who would be interested in causing such confusion? Satan the Devil. To bring about this confusion he used selfish and ambitious men. He induced them to make two others equal with God and to worship the creature more than the Creator. Paul puts it in these words: “Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, . . . changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.”—Romans 1: 21, 22, 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is a noticeable fact that in the church systems the name of Jesus has been made more prominent than that of Jehovah God. The clergy have induced the people to pray to Mary the mother of Jesus and to worship her, thus giving a woman honor equal with God. The names of Mary and Jesus are more often mentioned in the ecclesiastical systems than that of Jehovah God. The worship of idols and objects visible has also been induced by the clergy. The whole scheme and purpose of the master mind behind it has been to minimize the name of Jehovah and bring Him into reproach and ridicule and disrepute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is impossible to have a correct understanding of the divine plan of reconciliation of man to God until the proper relationship of Jesus and God is understood. It is therefore essential that the false doctrine called the trinity be exposed and removed from the minds of the people that the light of truth may shine into their minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is but one God, the Creator of heaven and earth, and the Giver of breath to all creation. Jesus is the Son of God, the beginning of God’s creation and the great executive officer of Jehovah God in carrying His plan into operation. The holy spirit is the invisible power of God which He gives to and which is used by those who are in full harmony with Hirn and who are assigned to perform service in. His name. Let the proof be made from God’s Word and then let the people abide by that. As Ilie ' apostle puts it: “Let God prove to be true, albeit every man be false!”—Rom..3: 4, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the next occasion the Scriptural proof will be examined, showing who is the true God and what is the relationship of Jesus Christ to Him. This is essential in order to understand the progressive steps for the reconciliation of man to God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Brooklyn still boasts of her pirate house of Mill Basin, built 272 years ago by Captain Martinse Schenck, a pupil of Captain</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Kidd. Captain Schenck even stole his wife from her parents in Holland, and subsequently tortured her because she talked too much about his private affairs. If Captain Schenck were alive today he would be a much honored officer of the Power Trust. The difference between making a man walk the plank and requiring him legally to pay for a service up to twenty times what it costs to produce it, is a mere trifle<sub>s</sub> not worth speaking of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sixty Servants in Attendance</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THE United States Geological Survey on -®- Power Capacity and Production in this country estimates that each person now lias the equivalent of sixty persons working for him constantly, the service consisting of machinery, tools and instruments, and their operation. The Survey might have added that with the Power Trust on the job about fifty-nine sixtieths of this will soon be in the hands of a few men and then the rest of us w’ill be back where we started. We can either buy the power from them at their price or we can do the work by hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Children’s Own Radio Story </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By G. J. W., Jr. </span><span class="font6">Story Fifteen</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">J</span><span class="font6">ESUS had -performed His first miracle, demonstrating to His disciples the power and glory of the holy spirit with which He had been anointed at Jordan by His Father, the great God Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With this power He had transformed six water-jars full of plain water into most delicious wine, at a wedding-feast in Cana of Galilee to which He and His disciples were invited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From there He went to Capernaum for a few days, in preparation for His visit to Jerusalem to attend the annual observance of the Jewish passover. It is in Jerusalem that we next take up the story of Jesus, for the next groat event in the Lord’s life took place in that city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the temple of God at Jerusalem, Jesus found many merchants and money-lenders plying their trades within the sacred walls. There were dealers in sheep and oxen, dealers in doves, and those who loaned or changed money at a profit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus was filled with righteous indignation when He behold these men making a businessplace out of the temple of Jehovah. With the power and authority of one whose right it was to act, Jesus made a whip or scourge of small, tough cords, and drove out of the temple all those who unlawfully held possession of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bible says of this event: “And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and. Jesus went up to Jerusalem, and found in. the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting. And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the tables, and said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now it may be imagined how surprised and upset the Jews were over this occurrence. The money-lenders and other merchants had been carrying on their business in the temple for a considerable time, and both they and the other residents of Jerusalem felt indignant at the treatment they received., and demanded an explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They therefore gathered together a committee and, approaching Jesus where He stood among the scattered effects of the sheep-dealers and money-changers, challenged Him. thus: “What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And Jesus made answer and said, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then the Jews answered scornfully: “Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days'?” But they did not understand that Jesus spoke of the temple of His body. Even His disciples did not understand that statement until long afterward, when Jesus was raised from the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then they remembered what Jesus had said about the temple, and understood, and they believed the scripture 'that was written concerning Jesus’ three days’ stay in the tomb, and they believed the words of Jesus, and their faith in Him was thereby strengthened. But the Lord purposely made many statements ■to His disciples and others that were not intended to be understood at that very time. When the right time should come, then those statements would be plain as day, showing how beautifully and wonderfully all the plans of God work out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of Jesus’ further acts while He was in Jerusalem at that time the Bible merely gives the following account:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The next event of which, we find record in the Bible’s account of Jesus’ life, is a very interesting conversation between Jesus and a man named Nicodemus, a rich man and a ruler of the class of Jews called Pharisees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From now on we must remember that Jesus often spoke in parables. A parable is a form of speech in which one tells a story that is not only interesting in itself but also serves to teach a lesson or paint a word-picture of something which, is to happen in the -future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus often used this form of expression in talking to His disciples, and nearly always when addressing those of Nicodemus’ class and type.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was during this conversation that Jesus made a certain statement that has been the hope and joy and comfort of humanity ever since. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>
