<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Fish and the Fishing Business</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4</span><span class="font5"> *1V<sup>E</sup> REMEMBER the fish, which we 'did eat</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We in Egypt for nought,” was the cry of the Israelites to Moses, and the supply of fish in Egypt is exceedingly plentiful to this day. Arrived in the promised land, the Israelites found the Sea of Galilee generously stocked with fish; and it is so today. It was from its fishermen that the apostles of Jesus and John the Baptist were gathered. Jesus caught, cooked and ate fish. That is reason enough why other human beings should do the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Doctor Johnson defined an angler as ‘a pole and line with a fool at one end and a worm at the other’; but that does not make it so. Fishermen are famous the world over for their plain, speech, honesty, quaintness of garb and their strange songs when hauling in their nets. There are known about 12,000 kinds of fishes, most of which are edible. Many fish thrown back into the sea because unmarketable are as good as or better than those eaten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Caraja Indians of South America do not know how’ to catch fish with hook and line, but shoot them with bow and arrow and are never without food, because the Amazon, where they hunt, has more kinds of fish than all other rivers of the world put together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On. the shores of the Mediterranean watchmen sit on the tops of high extension steel ladders and telephone to the fishermen when to go out for tuna fish, and where to find them. By means of sardine bait the tuna fish, are lured into a bay called the death chamber, where they are dispatched, after the entrance to the bay has been closed by a net. Only a few years ago tuna fish were considered inedible. Now they are a delicacy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the state of Maine, in winter, smelts are hunted through the ice by fishermen who move about and do their fishing from huts built on runners. An expert fisherman can catch sixty pounds of smelt a day, and there is always a ready market. This fishing is done with hook and line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Most profitable fishing is done with nets. It is estimated that three billion herrings are taken out of the seas every year, by means of nets, but that there are scores of shoals of herring any one of which would supply this number, with plenty to spare..</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Maintaining the Supply</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font5">N AMERICAN waters some six thousand vessels are regularly engaged in the fishing industry, a third of these in Alaskan waters, a third on the Pacific coast, a sixth, in New England, and the balance principally in the Gulf of Mexico. The industry employs two hundred thousand people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fishing industry of Canada is about half that of the United States in the value of the annual catch. In the year 1.918 that Canadian catch was worth $60,000,000, as compared with an Alaskan catch of $40,000,000 and a total American catch of something over $100,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of late years the fisherman with hook and line has been finding it harder and harder </span><span class="font6">to </span><span class="font5">bring in any considerable number of good-sized fish from the mountain streams, but this is being overcome by restocking from fish nurseries. Any farmer with a pond can obtain these fish for the asking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are now sixty fish nurseries from which at present 35,000,000 finger-length game fish, trout, bass and sunfish, are placed each year in the rivers, creeks and lakes of the country. The number of such nurseries will </span><span class="font6">be about </span><span class="font5">one hundred by the time this is in print, </span><span class="font6">and it </span><span class="font5">is hoped and believed that these nurseries </span><span class="font6">will </span><span class="font5">be able to replenish the waning stocks.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2">This</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">Some record-size fish caught in past years are: a twenty-five-pound bluefish caught in Cohasset Narrows, Mass.; a four-pound yellow perch caught at Bordentown, N. J.; a six-hun-dred-pound sawfish caught at Fort Myers, Fla.; an eight-pound sea-bass, a, fifty-two pound codfish and a nineteen-pound flounder, all caught in New York Bay; and a sixteen-pound weakfish caught at Fire Island inlet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in lehthyology</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font5">HE Governments of earth are cooperating in making a scientific study of fish, trying to find out where they are born, where they live, what they feed upon, the temperatures they prefer, and all about them. This is accomplished by tagging tens of thousands of them, with silver tags attached to their dorsal fins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Salmon No. 10,358, released one season south of Alaska, turned up the next season in a Siberian stream two thousand miles across the ocean. Science says that he made the trip to get to his wedding at the old home stream where he began life as an egg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A salmon that was liberated off Burns Point, Port Maitland, Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia, June 11, was killed, less than a month later in the Moisie River, Quebec, eight hundred miles away by the shortest route, and twelve hundred miles or more if it followed the larger indentations of the shore line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Off the coast of Haiti Doctor Beebe has been studying fish at night at the bottom of the ocean by means of electric lights. He went down in an ordinary bathing suit, noth feet and arms free and unprotected, his head fitted with the usual helmet, with its air and telephone connections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One variety which he studied carried at least five hundred (Dr. Beebe thought possibly as many as 5,000) lights, tiny pin points of light gleaming from every pore. These lights always disappeared with the death of the fish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Scientists of Leland Stanford University have spent years dredging and dragging the ocean bottom, looking for new forms of sea life. A recent volcanic upheaval in the Hawaiian Islands presented them suddenly with six unknown species, killed by the submarine explosions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The countless billions of the deep, in the last analysis, live on the submarine plant life, some of it attached to the bottom, but much of it floating and microscopic in form. In the South Pacific, west of Patagonia, there is a sea desert which contains so few forms of marine life of any kind that whales and sharks have been known to die of hunger before they could find their way out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Cod and haddock fishing has been greatly helped by the discovery that these fish are found only in waters of forty to fifty degrees Fahrenheit; hence a thermometer is as necessary to a modern fisherman as a net.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Fish Powers and Sensibilities</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The dolphin is known to attain a speed under A water of sixty miles an hour or better, and scientists have never been able to explain or understand how it is that a two-hundred-pound tarpon can leap twenty feet out of the water, when there is no land animal that can leap over twelve feet vertically. Many eases are known where tarpon have jumped over boats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Most fishes depend on speed to obtain their food or elude their enemies. Some have the power to change their color, like the chameleon, so as to imitate the color of the stones on which, they lie. Some are defended by bony coats of mail; others by pungent and sometimes envenomed spines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The nervous system is relatively small, its </span><span class="font5">structures feeble and the gray matter developed but slightly. The Greenland shark, when feeding on the carcass of a whale, will allow itself to be repeatedly stabbed in the head without seeming to notice it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fishes have little power to reproduce lost parts. Only the tips of fins or filaments are thus restored after an injury, but sometimes a fish will survive having its tail bitten off. Fishes have the sense of smell, using their nostrils for that purpose only. Their nostrils have no relation to the work of breathing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some fishes are attracted by music; some sounds are repellent to them. They die from shocks caused by lightning or explosions. They flee from actively moving objects. The fish known as the star-gazer has its eyes on the top of its head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Origin of the Siren Tales</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19280516_files/g_E_19280516-2.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">NCIENT literature contains allusions to sirens who lured seamen to destruction by running them upon reefs. Oddly enough, there is a sound basis for what was long believed to be merely a superstition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The phonograph fish, common in the Caribbean has on the top of its head a 'suckingplate' which has twenty-four slots that open and close at will, much in the manner of Venetian blinds. Through this extraordinary set of valves the fish gives music which has been likened to the jew’s-harp, violin, mandolin, banjo and mouth-organ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sailors say that a school of phonograph fish produce music of a strangely beautiful kind, and that the concerts last from one to twelve hours and are regarded as almost sure harbingers of bad weather. The shellfish of Ceylon also produce a long, low, fluty sound which, is distinctly musical. The butter-fish of Scotland makes a distinct hooting noise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are several fish that make noises like pigs; one in Miami harbor is called the grunt, because it grunts when taken out of the water. The cock-fish is so called because it crows. Another fish emits a note like the deep pedal of an organ, another utters a shriek, while another booms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Though most fish must always live in water, yet the climbing perch of India is able to leave its pond for two or three days at a time. It carries water in cells with which to moisten its gilh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Enemies of Fishes</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">HpHE chief enemy of the fishes is man. He is the only being that drops bombs of huge size and terrific explosive power into their home. Billions of fish have been slaughtered in this way in recent years, so much so that acres of sea surface have been covered with their floating bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many fishes are injured by man, and unintentionally at that. When fishes are thrown back into the water they should be handled with wet hands. If handled with dry hands, as is commonly done, the skin of the fish is injured so that it is liable to be attacked by parasites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Probably man is the only creature that imprisons fishes for his pleasure. Goldfish naturally prefer shaded depths. Men put them in glaring light. They need plenty of fresh air. Sometimes they get it and sometimes not. The square goldfish globes with large-sized castles in them are the best.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Japanese prefer goldfish with bulging eyes. They make the eyes bulge by confining the fish in dark tanks which have but two pinholes of light. The fish strain their eyes this way, and that to see, and eventually stretch </span><span class="font6">the  </span><span class="font5">muscles holding their eyes, and the eyeballs bulge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fish are kept out of irrigation canals by electrifying the -water at the intake. It shocks them and they dart away from the danger. Fish are drowned if held so that the water flows through their gills the wrong way. Eels and cod have been frozen until their hearts stopped beating, but when the water was warmed again their hearts resumed their beat and the fish regained their full activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Other Enemies of Fiskes</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19280516_files/g_E_19280516-3.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">HE porpoise is a champion destroyer of fishes. In the stomach of a single porpoise were found 15,193 otoliths or earbones of fishes, showing that at least half that number of fishes had found their grave in his interior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The pilot-fish or shark-sucker often rides the shark to its death. The sucker attaches itself to the shark so securely that the latter can not shake it off, and when the sucker is caught with hook and line the shark comes along too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The hagfish makes its home inside the throat of other fishes, leisurely eating one muscle after another until the fish is destroyed. The only possible escape for the bigger fish is to be captured and thrown back. When the big fish is captured the hagfish cpiickly jumps out of its mouth and escapes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The most curious and diabolical enemy of fishes is the jellyfish, a highly-organized animal, with a complex nervous system, which is so much water that if one of them is placed on </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font5">sheet of white blotting paper and left there several hours nothing will be left but a little stain. Jellyfish have been captured with tentacles 120 feet long and holding within their spacious interiors many hundreds of living fish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Portuguese man-of-war jellyfish is made up of a number of small animals of the jellyfish order, which have in common a bubble-like float which rests on the surface of the water. The float is furnished with a fin or sail and goes out looking for trouble. Some of the little animals which hang from the float supply nourishment for the colony; some give their attention solely to reproduction; some sting everything that conies along, arid are so effective that two or three of them drawn across a man’s arm will almost paralyze it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Uses of Fish &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">O</span><span class="font5">BVIOUSLY the principal use of fish is to fill man’s aching void, and most people are fond of certain kinds of fish, properly prepared. Many people who think they do not care for fish have really developed or inherited a distaste for stale fish. Fresh fish would affect them differently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is an odd law on the British statute books since the days of Queen Elizabeth that every person in Britain must eat fish every Wednesday or pay a fine of twenty pounds for each offense. The law has never been repealed. Such is the folly of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A </span><span class="font5">real use for minnows has been found. Put into the pools and streams of a malaria-infested district they will kill off all the mosquitoes; and with the mosquitoes go the malarial germs. It is figured out that on the basis of fifty-two towns it cost only seventy-eight cents per capita per year to keep the towns free from malaria by this means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Shark leathers and other sea leathers are now in much use. Oils are extracted from fish livers, and fertilizers are made from their flesh. Millions of pounds of fish scales are worked up </span><span class="font6">into </span><span class="font5">fish glue, backs for toilet articles, and waterproofing for clothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Boat-builders have spent much time studying the forms and lines of various fishes with a view to securing speedy models. Certain scales in a line on each side of the fish are pierced with tubes through which a slimy matter oozes that serves to lubricate the body and make it slippery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Butter-Fish, Carp, Devil-Fish</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font5">N MARCH the butter-fish, or oolakan, comes from the Pacific ocean and goes up the freshwater rivers of British Columbia. The Indians catch those by the millions, soften them a few days in the sun and put them into vats of boiling water. When the oil rises to the top it is skimmed off and is the supply of butter for the next year. When well rendered it has no suggestion of fishiness and is a palatable oil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The carp, in high favor with the Germans, is disliked in America. It breeds so fast that it soon overcrowds any small pond in which it is placed. The flesh is coarse and readily takes the taint of any impure water, but the fish will live for days after leaving the water if it is surrounded by damp moss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The devil-fish, in favor with Orientals, is also repelled by Americans. In catching the devil-fish, or octupus, the fishermen use empty barrels, attached to buoys and sunk in. deep water. A few strands of wire fastened across the end of the barrel coaxes the devil-fish to entwine his tentacles thereon. Each morning one or two octopi are generally found in each barrel. They are shipped alive in tanks and executed as sold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Eels, Goldfish, Goosefish</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19280516_files/g_E_19280516-4.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">HE female eel can not eject her eggs except by powerful pressure from the outside, and the Sargasso Sea is the only place in the North Atlantic ocean where the water is deep enough to provide the hydraulic pressure; hence all the eels of Europe and America have their birth in the one place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is but a slight difference between the European eel and the American eel, but both are born in the same place; yet the European eel never goes to the west and the American eel never goes to the east. There is an eel in South Africa and Australia which exceeds fifty feet, in length.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Eels are the wolves of the stream. They hunt in packs, not hesitating collectively to tackle any fish, no matter how big or dangerous. Eels make their way over any obstacles and through the wet grass at night to ponds some distance away from any streams, the ponds from which their mothers started on the long, long route to the Sargasso Sea. The mothers never come back from their long journey but die when their children are born.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a large market for goldfish. Most families have a fewy and the collective number sold is enormous. A couple in Lebanon, Missouri, began the raising of goldfish through a mere accident, the dropping of two goldfish into a pond on the place. Six years later they were selling $20,000 worth of goldfish a year. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The goosefish is of most ungainly appearance, with an enormous head and a mouth of extraordinary dimensions, but the fish is excellent food and highly prized in Europe. In America it is estimated that at least ten million pounds are caught incidentally and .thrown' away because there is no market for it. Britain consumes six million pounds of it annually.</span></p>

Thus their course</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">THH failure of the herring ’ industry of the 1 North Sea is said to be due to the fact that the currents in the North Sea have changed their course. The herring which once swarmed about the Scottish coast have now gone elsewhere and with them the living of the fisherfolk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The menhaden, extremely abundant, and with excellent food qualities of its own, is seldom or never used for food in America, but utilized almost exclusively as a source of oil and fertilizer. Menhaden, move in large schools and prey upon other food fish which are more highly prized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sea mussels, a delectable shellfish, much prized in England and France, are but little known in the United States, because the fishermen do not like to take on the job of supplying anything new. They can be cooked in any way that the oyster can be cooked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Oyster, Pike, great fish</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font5">HE oyster, nine-tenths water and once believed to have little nutritive value, is </span><span class="font6">now </span><span class="font5">known to be especially good in cases of tuberculosis and habitual dyspepsia. The oyster increases the flow of pepsin and hydrochloric acid, and its juices contain in unusually assimilable form the iodine, iron, phosphorus and lecithin . which the body needs to keep in good health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Japanese oysters, grown in Puget Sound, have reached a length of twelve inches and a weight  of ten ounces. ■ 7 ' ■■■ &lt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The pike is called the tiger of the stream, because of its ferocity. It is the boss and bully of the water world, cruel to the smaller fish and not afraid to fight with the biggest ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The great fish is believed to be the type of fish that swallowed Jonah, though some think Jonah remained in the mouth chamber of </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font5">certain type of whale. Three of these fish have been caught in recent years off Miami. The Schlegel fish, caught in June, 1919, weighed twenty-five thousand pounds; the Captain Thompson fish thirty thousand pounds, and the Nolan fish, of the same variety, forty thousand pounds. The Nolan fish was caught in 1923.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salmon and Shad</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">S</span><span class="font5">ALMON are born and spend their minnowhood in fresh water; then they go to sea and remain there until near the end of life, ■ when they return to fresh water to die. They in life is exactly the opposite of the eels, which are born in salt water, spend their lives in fresh water and return to the salt water to die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Alaska, salmon are caught in a fish netj often a mile long, arranged in such a </span><span class="font6">way that </span><span class="font5">when salmon go in they can not escape. </span><span class="font6">These </span><span class="font5">traps are anchored at the mouth of fresh water, where salmon enter from the ocean to spawn. When a fish is caught approximately six thousand spawn are destroyed. An Indian, writing to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dearborn Independent,</span><span class="font5"> puts the situation thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I am an Indian fisherman. The best fish that swims in the waters of Alaska is the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">red salmon.</span><span class="font3"> Ever since the Indian came to Alaska, it has been his food. He has dried them and smoked them for winter use. But the salmon is a thing of the past in the rivers where he once caught them for his children to eat. The salmon are now caught in large traps before they go up the river to spawn. . . . There are times when the canneries can not touch the fish for days, and the pockets get so full that the fish kill each other for want of space. Salmon must be cleaned at once to be of any use; it can not lie around. . . . If the Alaska salmon is going to be cleaned out by </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fish traps,</span><span class="font3"> what are the Indian and his children, going to live on? ... We are not asking for something belonging to fish trap owners. We are asking for something belonging to God, who made it for all mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A favorite fish of the Atlantic seaboard is the shad, which lives in the ocean ten months of every year, but spawns in fresh water. Man knows nothing of its habits except that salt , water destroys its eggs. The flesh is exceptionally tasteful, though full of small bones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The government, thinking that the California people would appreciate a real blessing when placed right under their noses, planted shad in the Pacific streams where they had not before existed. They have multiplied and filled the streams, but do you suppose you can get those spoiled Californians </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font5"> eat them? No, sir! But they catch them and ship them east where there is a market for them, and the East pays the freight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Sharks, Swordfish and Whales</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font5">HE shark, contrary to all belief, is usually</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">harmless, though a shark which strays into northern waters, where food is relatively scarce, might and sometimes does attack a bather. In the South the barracuda is considered far more dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Captain Charles Thompson, of Miami, is said to have killed over ten thousand sharks and to be deathly afraid of them, yet he says he has never known one of them to attack a bather. The largest shark ever caught off the coast of Florida weighed 26,594 pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">England eats three hundred tons of shark meat daily and enjoys it under the fancy name of rock salmon. In fastidious New York the same fish is sold under the title of sturgeon, or sometimes deep-water swordfish. The hide of the shark is very valuable, making a leather which is almost indestructible. A firm in Baltimore, engaged in shoe manufacture, has a department devoted exclusively to the manufacture of shark-leather shoes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The swordfish is the limit for fish pugnacity. When enraged it has been known to pierce the thick planking of a ship and. often runs its sword clear through the bottom of an ordinary fishing boat. The flesh is firm, hard, of a delicate salmon color, and the best fish on the market to keep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some whales spend the summer in the Arctic and the winter in the Antarctic, with the result that they are apt to he seen anywhere in the spring or fall. Whaling is one of the most dangerous of occupations, but it is profitable, and what is there men will not do for money? .A good-sized whale may furnish two hundred fifty or more barrels of oil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Russia Five Years Ago </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By A. W. Sparrow</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">M</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">e. Dann’s article, &quot;Anti-Russian Poison,” conveys a different impression of that country from that obtained by the writer during a visit to the Ukraine in 1923. Without wishing to disparage that article, it is hoped to present another angle to readers of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The impression obtained was that of all the evil birds in the Devil’s cage the Soviet government is the most repulsive. As justification, the following evidence is submitted by the witness, now a Bible student.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One day a small girl, about eight years of age, approached the ship’s side. The emaciated body of this poor child was pitiable to behold. A member of the crew threw a piece of bread; but before she could compose herself sufficiently to eat, an armed guard dealt her a savage blow, tore the bread away, and threw it into the harbor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Soviet regulations allowed nothing to be given to the Russians. At the same time a horde of officials compelled the ship to furnish them a substantial meal daily. Never in the course of visits to fifty foreign lands has the writer seen such ruffians in official positions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The condition of so many of the children one encountered leaves painful memories of the ragged, hungry, and homeless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was surprising to note such furtiveness and apprehension written on the faces of natives when conversing with a stranger in that</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">land of liberty (?). Free speech? Non-existent. Free press? None. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After six years of Soviet misrule the lot of the common people was miserable. Sanitation in the poverty-stricken homes was conspicuous by its absence; a great epidemic of cholera had taken toll the previous year, while clothing was scanty and, in the majority of cases, made of sacking material. Utter hopelessness, developing into stoic fatalism, seemed to be the keynote everywhere. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Desolation reigned in industrial areas, as it did in quite a number of residential streets. Wrecked buildings were on almost every hand. Curiosity about one particular group elicited the information that they were torn down by the residents in the vicinity during the winter in order to obtain the woodwork for fuel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The writer was involved in an example of Soviet treachery. Visiting a certain Soviet club, he was requested to sign the visitors’ register, which request was complied with. It turned out that the visitors’ register constituted a declaration of protest against the Curzon note, for this protest (in which others were also involved) was published in the local government newspaper, with a translation in English (sic) alongside. A copy of this nervspaper is still in the writer’s possession. Of course he would have knowingly signed his name to no such document. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;In connection with this same Curzon note feeling ran high against Britain, and the officials generally appeared to contemplate war with glee. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The foregoing data appears to fairly represent the condition of that part of Russia in 1923, many other similar incidents being omitted for space considerations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That Socialism, whether the brand operating in Russia, or the milder variety found in Britain, is not beneficial to mankind, but is actually derogatory thereto, is a conclusion being increasingly forced on the writer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is only one hope for the peoples </span><span class="font6">of </span><span class="font5">Russia—and every other nation. Thank God </span><span class="font6">it </span><span class="font5">is a certainty: The Kingdom of Christ.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">To us all they said, Buy bonds and collect interest, because it costs you no work. Here is a clear expression from our head government officials, sanctioning and fostering the practice of getting money without work. In effect, such propaganda tends to debauch the whole citizenry of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No government, ancient or modem ever promulgated a more wicked policy than that. It is clearly the spirit of the robber, the hijacker, the murderer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why all this robbery in high places? And if it is so frequent in high places, why should we be surprised that it goes on at increased rate in the common walks?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The answer is, our government officials </span><span class="font6">have </span><span class="font5">set the pace. Our Treasury Department </span><span class="font6">says, </span><span class="font5">“Get interest; it is money without work.” </span><span class="font6">They </span><span class="font5">recommend it; our courts, in most instances, sanction it; our churches and ministers seem to indorse it, and yet in principle it is just exactly on a par with the methods of the holdup man. The usurer forces us to pay interest, or we get no money. Do not say, we can let it alone. That would be foolish. Every wheel of commerce stops if the usurer withdraws his funds. No government and no man can get along without money or credit, and yet none can be gotten without paying this toll.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every dollar of both money and credit issued in the United States draws its interest toll from one to five times each year. Fifteen or twenty billion dollars is gathered in each year by these holdups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We must have a medium of exchange, and under present law we must pay interest or we can not get it. It is a holdup game, pure and simple; getting money without work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The pickpocket, the hijacker, the strangler, are all holdup men. They get their money without work. The embezzler, the swindler, the confidence man, the briber, all get their money without work. The blackmailer, the blackhander, the bootlegger, the gambler, the smuggler, the defrauder, the counterfeiter, all get tneir money without work. So do the safecrackers, the robbers and the murderers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Nearly all so-called high finance is just anothername for getting money without work, and in some way moral ethics is always broken, and the public is wronged every time a man gets his income of $10,000 a year and over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The United States government is supposed to he an agent of the people, but really it seems to be doing business mainly for the Federal Reserve system. This is wrong. The Federal Reserve system should be made to do business both for the head government and for the people individually, and the only way to bring about this reform is for Congress to frame a competing banking system, coin its own money just as it now coins the banker’s money; pay its own debts ■with its own money; lend without interest to states for all public purposes and all home building purposes, and thus get from under the domination of so-called national and Federal money lenders, for they are literally a band of private holdups stalking under the license and protection of the United States government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When our government treasurer importunes us to get money without work, right then and there lie annuls and abrogates the whole moral law in finance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Pise Method of Construction</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">K</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ael J. Ellington, Grand Vista Ranch, Port Angeles, Washington, has spent a fortune in the last few years trying to interest his fellow men in the Old World pise method of building homes, garages, barns, chicken-houses and other buildings out of rammed earth. Mr. Ellington says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In this country there has never been much information available concerning the pise method. The main reason for this is that there is no chance for money-making in the work of making the method known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“On the contrary, this work has to be carried on by some one who is willing to sacrifice time and some money just for a good cause for the benefit of his fellow men, and especially as a help to farmers and settlers and to all who prefer to make their homes out in the country, where we' get most of God’s fresh air and sunshine and where the best people are raised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Another reason why the pise method is so little known is that any attempt at propaganda for the method is always met with so much 'doubt and disbelief, and even ridicule, that ordinarily these obstacles would kill in a short time the educational effort in question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“As a rule any kind of soil on -which vegetation will grow can be utilized as building </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ma</span><span class="font5">terial in the pise method, though some soils are what may be termed first class and others second class, but by blending it is always possible to use even those soils which are not otherwise sufficiently good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Almost every one has seen or heard of clay buildings such as adobe or sun dried brick buildings. They are known to be healthy and dry, and they are cool in summer and warm in winter. But these methods are limited to certain suitable clay soils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“By the rammed earth method the compression process makes it possible to use much poorer soils, because in all soils there are various kinds of silicates which wi11 act as binding or cementing substances when all particles are brought close enough together, -which is done by the ramming process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In this way we imitate -in a small way what Nature has done when making all sorts of sedimentary rock formations, which, as every geologist knows, were made from layers of loose sediments or mud, this being Mother Nature’s pise and not the work of any cement company. Rammed earth walls also have a much greater load-carrying capacity than adobe and other clay-built walls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“So no one need think that he has not suitable building soil at his building site or nearby. And the method of building can be understood and mastered by any one who is willing to handle rammers and exercise proper care in the details of this interesting and useful art.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“It is the same old reliable method by which old Hannibal built strong forts during his warfare, and the same method by which the outer walls of such a wonderful architectural creation as the Palace of Alhambra in Spain were built many hundreds of years ago, which walls are still defying time and rough elements.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Portland Cement in Iowa (and Elsewhere?) </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Frank W. Busey</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font5">OWA is about to spend perhaps more than $100,000,000 in concrete road work. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a great deal of misunderstanding among the mass of people about cement, owing to such slogans as “Concrete for Permanence” and other misleading—and mendacious—literature put out by the cement interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘‘Portland Cement” is an indefinable term, as “Iowa Flour”. Iowa flour might be spring wheat, winter wheat, buckwheat, rye, wild rice, corn, spelts, not to mention other varieties. It might be low-grade straight, patent, whole wheat, graham, pumpernickel, shorts, etc., or any of ten thousand and one, or more, combinations of any two or all of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The flour miller knows what he is doing and can furnish the baker with any combination that he may desire. He can and must designate on the sack what it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Corresponding knowledge is NOT known by the cement miller. But he has pull enough ■with the legislature not to be compelled to so mark his sacks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As the cement miller does not know’—and doesn’t care much—it necessarily follows that engineers and cement workers are &quot;going it blind”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It should be understood that if clients will demand concrete work, they and NOT the profession must take the responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is not to be taken as an alibi for an engineer who may take a bribe for passing defective work, or who accepts work that starts to go to pieces before the job is finished or who is guilty of any professional act involving moral turpitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such are punishable under the law and the Iowa Engineering Society hereby states to the world that, if the authorities properly prosecute such engineers, they are doing the profession a favor as well as ’doing their duty by their constituents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The crux of the whole matter is this: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">There is no such thing</span><span class="font5"> as cement that can be DEPENDED on to last—therefore no such thing as reliable concrete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The makers of cement really know less about the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">essentials</span><span class="font5"> of their business than the Grand Goblin of the Ku KIux Klan knows about saying Pontifical High Mass in the Sistine Chapel of the Vatican.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">[Mr. Dusey backs up his article by photographs showing the present disgraceful condition of Locust Street Bridge, Des Moines, in the construction of which 12,000 barrels of cement and 200,000 pounds of steel reinforcement were used. His aim is to make the cement makers take some real interest in their business, separate their inferior cement from their best goods, mark the product accordingly, and thus save humanity such harrowing scenes as the bursting of the Santa Clara dam, with its resultant loss of hundreds of precious lives. It is impossible to build a safe dam with poor cement.—Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Fifty Years Hence</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font5">N AN address before the Engineers’ Club of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Philadelphia, Samuel Rea, retired president of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, expressed some thoughts as to probable conditions fifty years hence which we are sure will be of interest to many of our readers. He said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some time in the future, perhaps by 1977, if not earlier, we may conceive that all small and inefficient plants will be closed down and heat and power obtained from central plants where the utilization of fuels is a specialized branch of engineering. Fuels are destined to become so valuable to the human race as a whole that they will be placed only in the hands of those who can to the greatest advantage control their combustion. Scarcely anything is more archaic in our civilization, or more wasteful in the eyes of the economist, than our individual house-heating systems, in which all but a small fraction of the potential heat of the fuel is dissipated upon the outside atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The gas business, as a public utility, will supply practically all heat distribution in urban localities. As capital cheapens, it will become possible to construct distributing systems furnishing cheaply produced gas for house-heating purposes as well as cooking. Industries in many cases will similarly be supplied with gas for fuel instead of burning coal in individual furnaces under boilers. We may then realize the smokeless city, and added sunlight will greatly improve the health of urban dwellers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By 1977 the reactionary properties of practically all the elements will be known and the chemist will be able to produce artificially, at will, a vastly increased number of substances useful in every art.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">of Dr. Alsaker’s Article</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">An Opinion</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font5">N ARTICLE by Dr. Rasmus Alsaker appeared in the January, 1928, issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Correct Eating</span><span class="font5"> (Volume 7, No. 1), which was designed to answer Dr. Wm. Held, Director of the United States Health League. Dr. Held’s article appeared in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font5"> of New York city, on November 16, 1927. Dr. Alsaker also made a number of statements regarding this <sub>1</sub> writer and his crusade to safeguard human health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The whole situation upon aluminum kitchen ■utensils and aluminum baking powders seems to have greatly confused the doctor. Frequently misunderstanding takes place from lack of investigation or understanding of the facts. 4'onfusion of this character can be likened to a j &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;storm at sea. When the storm abates, the true</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">mariner must resort to the sextant and compass</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">to determine just how far he has been driven</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">from his true course. So this writer feels that</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the public is entitled to know just how far Dr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Alsaker, in his teachings, has been driven from</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">a true cour.se; also, how<sup>7</sup> he has misstated facts pertaining to my book and other literature and the purpose of this crusade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is of no public moment what Dr. Alsaker may think of me. It is of no public moment what I may think of Dr. Alsaker. It is of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">great moment to the American public</span><span class="font5"> whether or not aluminum is a poison when ingested. If it is a fact that aluminum compounds are ingested in food and drink or that they are given in medicines and that such compounds are poisonous to the human body, then it is high time that the public be informed of the fact, even though certain persons do not like it. It is evident that Dr. Alsaker desires his readers to believe that my crusade is organized solely for the purpose of slandering aluminum cooking utensils. This is misinformation to his readers. The crusade pertains to aluminum compounds in food, drink or medicine, regardless of the source from which they are received by the human body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I believe Dr. Alsaker is a man of more than ordinary intelligence. He says he lias read </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">An Opinion Upon Aluminum</span><span class="font5"> and other printed material. Only two of the ten photographs in the book have reference to aluminum cooking utensils. The other eight have reference to minerals in medicines and water purifiers manufactured for the sick. How any man of even ordinary intelligence could possibly misinterpret all of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Dr. Charles T. Beits</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the photographs and subject matter so as to make it appear entirely a crusade upon aluminum kitchen Avare, or why he did it, is beyond my comprehension. It seems to me that a deliberate misrepresentation of the work was made by the doctor to his readers. Following is the first statement of article No. 1 and the first statement in the last article in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">An Opinion Upon Aluminum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is the purpose of this paper to acquaint you with my opinion concerning the ill effects caused by the use of aluminum utensils for cooking food, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">also aluminum used in various forms as food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The purpose of this paper is to cause the reader to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">thinJc</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">experiment</span><span class="font3"> for himself regarding the following opinions of mine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. Alsaker'seriously objects to the fact that this writer is giving information to the public in reference to health outside of his particular line, dentistry. Teaching of health matters or instructing people how to keep well is surely not within the realm of the duties of physicians. A physician’s work applies principally to prescribing medicines for, and giving treatment to, the sick. Most of those whom this writer knows are kept so busy attending the sick that they can not secure proper rest. I do not believe the public expects physicians to teach them upon such topics. In recent years, quite a large medical union has been formed and when any one attempts to interfere with the financial income of its members, by attempting to give health information, the leaders of the organization make a direct attack upon such persons at once. The attack upon my integrity and motives by Dr. Morris Fishbein, October, 1926, in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">American Medical Journal,</span><span class="font5"> is now practically repeated by Dr. Rasmus Alsaker in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Correct Eating,</span><span class="font5"> January, 1928. This method is used by the medical organization against practically all real teachers of nutritional principles. There are thousands of physicians belonging to the medical union who do not approve of their leaders’ actions or writings in this manner, but they are powerless to prevent it. This writer has never given the information to the public that he is a physician. It would indeed be a great mistake for him to do so, because of the fact that the public, in his opinion, does not look to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">medical union</span><span class="font5"> as now organized, for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">instruction in health matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The nine ways mentioned below in which we receive aluminum compounds may be only the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“vaporings”</span><span class="font5"> of my mind, which Dr. Alsaker refers to in his article; but I believe they are </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">realities</span><span class="font5"> and that many have taken such compounds to their sorrow. I also believe it is high time that such men as Dr. Alsaker and others of exalted position should first investigate before they condemn. Any one taking such drugs from only one source might be able to throw off much of the poison; but when a person takes them from three or more sources at the same time, the effects may be very noticeable. It may also he possible that medical secrets should not be given to the public. The doctor has forced this writer to make some of them known, in the following paragraphs. My literature treats upon the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Aluminum compounds in city drinking water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Aluminum compounds in medicines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Aluminum compounds from aluminum water purifiers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Aluminum compounds in baked goods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Aluminum compounds in whiskies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Aluminum compounds in baking powders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Aluminum compounds injected before major operations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Aluminum compounds for bases for false teeth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Aluminum compounds from cooking utensils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Morticians may use aluminum compounds for embalming the dead. No objection can be made to their use in the body when life is extinct or when&quot; used as a mordant in the coloring matter in the clothes which are used to cover the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Aluminum Compounds in City Drinking Water</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">ALUMINUM mixed in proper molecular proportions with sulphuric acid is extensively used as a water clarifying or purifying agent, in many cities of the United States. Of course such small amounts of such, poisons as ingested from drinking a single glassful of such water are supposed to be negligible in effect. This may be time, but the continued drinking of such water may have cumulative effects. This writer had no idea that such quantities are used, as are used, by various city water departments. Investigation of our Toledo water supply proved that about 3000 tons of this mixture are used per annum for the above-named purpose. One tablespoonful of sulphuric acid or two ounces of aluminum, either administered in a single dose, is sufficient to cause death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Toledo </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Tinies,</span><span class="font5"> December 2, 1926, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Expenditure of $55,000 to purchase 2,200 tons of aluminum sulphate for the division of water was approved by the council finance committee Wednesday night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Does Dr. Alsaker believe this material is non-poisonous, or should we take the poison regularly? He does not dearly set forth his opinions in this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Aluminum Compounds in Utedielnes</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">ALUMINUM hydroxide and alumina waters are widely prescribed for the sick. When a person becomes addicted to a drug habit, the effect which the drugs produce can be relieved, seemingly, only by taking another potion of the drug. Any one who has, at any time, been familiar with tire habits of a cocaine or morphine addict can attest to the fact that when he can not secure more of the drug he usually becomes extremely nervous and lapses into a more pitiable condition. When he takes another dose of the same poison, apparently he is relieved. In fact he is only consuming more poison with its dire result.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So with the aluminum drug. &quot;When one consumes aluminum drugs, an acidosis condition follows, due to the great absorbing power of the drug. When the acids of the stomach are continually absorbed by such an element, more and' more acid is formed by the body. Then to relieve the acidosis condition more aluminum hydroxide or alumina waters are prescribed as a cure, which, in fact, like the cocaine drug, seems to give relief to the sufferer. It is my belief that such relief is only temporary, leaving the consumer in a worse condition than before taking. Dr. Alsaker intimates that if the aluminum drug is good for the sick it would not have an evil effect on other persons taking it, who are well. This may be correct from the doctor’s viewpoint but not from one of the laity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Aluminum Compounds from Water Purifiers</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">W</span><span class="font5">ATER purifiers of various makes are manufactured in this country, and I am informed that the American public paid millions of dollars for such instruments during 1,926. They are represented to be, and are sold as, water purifiers. They are especially used</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">&lt;:r ■? cv'&gt;.-Ci’s<sup>5</sup> '’\led to the sick who have nephritis (kidney disease). This writer has found persons using the instrument for the purpose prescribed, who were not relieved of their condition but were </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">poisoned instead</span><span class="font5"> by drinking the “purified&quot; water. The “purifiers” are made of aluminum. Large quantities of the metal dissolve from the instrument, forming a poisonous aluminum compound which the patient consumes. He is informed that the materials produced, which can be seen in the water, are impurities contained therein before the purifying process began. It is high time, in my opinion, that such objectionable instruments should be prohibited from being sold to the American public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It would be interesting to know if Dr. Alsaker has issued any warning to his readers regarding aluminum water purifiers or if he approves of their use. He does not mention this subject in his article, although three photographs in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">An Opinion Upon Aluminum</span><span class="font5"> have reference to such an instrument.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Aluminum Compounds in Baked Goods</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ALUMINUM compounds are placed in various white flours for bleaching purposes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This material is used by various millers, also by bakers, during the mixing process. It is used for the purpose of making better-looking products than it would otherwise be possible to make; and this in turn, for the purpose of a greater sale of such baked goods. A serious poisoning case occurred on January 9, 1928, at the Army Air Corps Cafeteria, Dayton, Ohio. It was suspected that too much mineral (aluminum), which was put in the dough of which the pies were made, caused the poisoning. More than 200 were stricken with poison. For a report of this case I refer the reader to the .Dayton. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Journal,</span><span class="font5"> January 10, 1928.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">EFO.RE 1917 it was an offense in. this country for the makers of various brands of whiskey to place alum in their product for the purpose of producing an “'aged taste”. “Green whiskey” could be sold as “old whiskey” after using alum. After 1918, when whiskey was outlawed. bootleggers resorted to the use of aluminum compounds extensively, for the purpose of ••aging'” whiskey. So this is another manner in which the American public consumes many tons of the metal. To produce this “aging” effect, an aluminum electric stick is used by bootleggers. For the full description of this process I refer the reader to a bootlegger’s confession as published in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Liberty Magazine,</span><span class="font5"> January 8, 1927. Does Dr. Alsaker prefer whiskey with or without aluminum (alum)? He does not inform us in his article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Aluminum Compounds in Baking Powders</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">TAr. Alsaker claims that “'an individual can favor aluminum utensils and at (he same time be consistent in opposing the use of alum in baking powder because alum is a complex compound, being made of aluminum potassium sulphate”. Aluminum baking powders now, and for many years, have not been made .with aluminum potassium sulphate, and I believe the doctor is acquainted with that fact. Sodium aluminum sulphate is used instead. However, the poisonous element, in my opinion, is the uZiuninuin and not the potassium, ammonium or sodium. Aluminum potassium sulphate is ordinary alum purchased in drug stores. Sodium aluminum sulphate is used in alum baking powders. When salt -and soda are used for seasoning foods, during the cooking process in aluminum ware, the same kind of poison is produced in the food a-s is made by baking powders containing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">sodium aluminum sulphate.</span><span class="font5"> It seems incredible that any man, posing as a health expert, could possibly make such a misstatement of fact and advise his readers not to use baking powders containing aluminum compounds, and still be consistent in advising them to eat the same poisons in smaller quantities, as formed by aluminum ware. This kind of reasoning would give one to understand that a bite from a ten-year-old rattlesnake is apt to be poisonous and should be avoided, while a bite from one three years old would not be poisonous, because the person bitten would receive a smaller amount of the poison. I do not believe we can consume poisons of this character in small amounts without evil or cumulative effects upon the body. Dr. Alsaker is not alone in his opinion that small doses of potent poison do little or no harm when ingested in foods from cooking utensils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. Harvey Wiley is of the opinion that aluminum in baking powders is consumed in such greater quantities that the amounts ingested from, aluminum kitchen utensils are insignificant in comparison; but he says if aluminum utensils produce such damage as this writer represents, he wants to know it. How different is Dr. Alsaker. He admits in his article that he has complete power </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">to settle</span><span class="font5"> the matter for the American public. I am pleased to present here Dr. Harvey Wiley’s opinion, because it is in perfect harmony with my views upon aluminum baking powders. His opinion on such powders can not be misunderstood:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The ease against the Royal Baking Powder Company* has developed the source of nearly all the aluminum which enters the stomachs of the American people. I imagine, without having stopped to make any computations, that where one gram of aluminum enters the stomachs of the American people from the aluminum vessels used in cooking, five thousand grams enter the stomachs of the American people from the use of alum baking powders. I have been told by those who are more or less acquainted with the statistics of the use of baking powders, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">that at least 80% of all the baking powders used, in the United States are made of alum. 1 believe it would be a step toward proper nutrition if these facts could be brought out, and I am pleased to note that you are endeavoring to place these facts before the American people.</span><span class="font3"> At the same time, the extremely minute quantities of alum entering our stomachs through the abrasion of the aluminum cooking utensil as compared with the total amount derived from alum baking powders do not require any particular stress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Will Dr. Alsaker kindly state at what time he has ever advised his readers that aluminum baking powders are dangerous for human consumption ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Injected Before Major Operations</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font5">T HAS been found by medics and chemists that aluminum compounds can be used to stop the How of blood, to a large extent, during major operations. The injecting of such compounds usually takes place shortly before the operation. They are widely used and the results are obvious, The action of aluminum on the capillaries of the arterial system is such as</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">♦For the reader’s information, the writer desires to state that certain manufacturers of alum baking powders claimed that they did not use </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">alum,</span><span class="font3"> but a harmless compound called </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sodium aluminum sulpiioU,</span><span class="font3"> in their products. They invoked the aid of the Federal Trade Commission of the United: States to compel the Royal Baking Powder Company to desist from stating, in their advertising matter, that Royal products contained no alum, etc. The Commission decided there was no cause for action against the “Royal” Company and after a thorough examination which covered a period of about six years, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">case</span><span class="font3"> was dismissed on March 23,1926. </span><span class="font5">to clog them up, causing a more difficult flow of blood, making the operation a very simple affair, which otherwise would be quite serious from loss of blood. Even though the operation is successful the patient frequently dies. The chemists making the material for the trade advise in their literature that physicians should give the product by mouth because it is liable to cause “shock” when given subcutaneously or intravenously. Tn other words, embolism (thickening of all the blood) may take place. I refer you to a published statement in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Colloids in Medicine,</span><span class="font5"> August, 1922, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The positive electric charge of aluminum hydroxide in suspensoid colloidal solution is particularly strong and after intravenous injection increases the ionic </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">concentration of the blood</span><span class="font3"> so as to produce </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">shock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I refer you to the statement of Dr. Victor Vaughn, for thirty years Dean of the Medical Department at the University of Michigan. The statement was made before the Federal Trade Commission, under oath, and is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Practically, alum is the only salt of aluminum from which poisonous effects are likely to result. This is. true merely because alum is the only soluble salt of aluminum that is widely used. All Salts of aluminum are poisonous when injected subcutaneously or intravenously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A statement of this kind coming from one of our most prominent internationally known scientists can mean only one thing and that is exactly what it. says, that aluminum compounds are widely used and injected into the human body for certain specific purposes. Does Dr. Alsaker approve of this kind of therapy! In his article lie does not make any statement regarding it but,-completely avoids the subject, except as a “vaporing”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Aluminum Compounds as Bases for False Teeth</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">NOTHER very important matter is the making of artificial dentures (false teeth).</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19280516_files/g_E_19280516-14.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">Base plates are made of aluminum to support artificial teeth. A case is now under observation, of a patient who wore an aluminum plate eight years before a lesion (sore) appeared on the upper lip. The patient’s lip was treated for a period of about two years. Then she was advised to have the rest of her teeth extracted. I advised removing her aluminum plate and substituted a rubber one instead. The surgeon! again removed the ■ diseased portion, .which caused the loss of most of the upper lip. She has worn a rubber plate for nine years with no</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">recurrence of the malady., Three of such eases in my practise have convinced this writer that aluminum plates for false teeth should not be constructed. I do not know if Dr. Alsaker recommends aluminum plates or not. He does not mention them in his article, even though the aluminum is in contact with the alkaline saliva twenty-four hours a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Aluminum Compounds from Cooking Utensils</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">r. Alsaker states that he made “the test in reference to compounds dissolving from</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19280516_files/g_E_19280516-15.png" alt="" style="width:16pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">aluminum cooking utensils and that he did not find any particular amount of aluminum compounds in the water used in his home or by the tests which he made”. He intimates that probably only Toledo (Ohio) water would be such that the test made with reference to the second photograph in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">An Opinion Upon Aluminum </span><span class="font5">would show the amount of aluminum hydroxide, as shown in the book. Tests have been made with city waters in every large city in the United States,’including Dr. Alsaker’s city, St. Louis, Mo., and every one of them proves that alumin</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">um</span><span class="font5"> compounds dissolve from aluminum cooking utensils, as photographed in the book, except in Sacramento, California, Salt Lake City, Utah, and Denver, Colorado, where a lesser amount was shown by the tests, and this because snow water from the mountains W’as used. As further proof of this statement, I quote Dr. A. S. Cushman, Washington, D. C. The doctor made an examination for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Good Housekeeping</span><span class="font5"> magazine, March, 1915. He and Dr. Harvey Wiley made a number of tests along this line, with waters from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">various sources. </span><span class="font5">At tor umuths of investigation, the following statements were made. Dr. A. S. Cushman writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fififiAAie</span><span class="font3"> actual loss in weight suffered by the aluminum ware in these experiments as the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">average</span><span class="font3"> of a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">number of separate tests</span><span class="font3"> was equal to about 30/100 of a grain of aluminum per pound of acid liquid used and'35/100 of a grain per pound of the sailed acid liquid used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">- The alkali liquid caused an attack upon the aluminum just four times as great as the acid liquid (1-40/100 ' grains per pound per hour of cooking).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. Harvey Wiley’s opinion:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Aluminum hydroxide if taken in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">quantities</span><span class="font3"> as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">you get if in foods</span><span class="font3"> prepared in aluminum cooking vessels is negligible in effect. Taken in sufficient quantity </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">it is poisonous .... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Public Health Division of the U. S. Government is right in regard to acid foods but </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">wrong</span><span class="font3"> in regard to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">alkaline</span><span class="font3"> foods. As a rule all meats are slightly alkaline and meats should not be cooked in aluminum vessels therefore. All fruits and vegetables, on the other hand, are slightly acid and they may be cooked in aluminum vessels with impunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Foods, like rolled oats, are often cooked .in aluminum double boilers all night, and all. fireless cookers of which this writer knows anything are produced for the purpose of cooking foods which are to be left standing in the cookers for an indefinite period of time, until ready to serve. It would be of interest to know if Dr. Alsaker condemns all aluminum tireless cookers on this account or if he has a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">stated specified time</span><span class="font5"> that foods should be cooked in aluminum. This necessarily would have to be taken into consideration because he plainly states that “it is best not to leave food standing in aluminum ware or any other metal ware after it has been cooked”. All aluminum companies’ kitchen utensil literature that I have read flatly contradicts the doctor’s statement regarding foods left standing in aluminum, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">after being cooked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It seems to this writer that when such </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">prominent persons</span><span class="font5"> (high-minded, as he calls them) do not agree, it might be well to investigate the matter a little further, so the laity (myself included) will know if food should stand in aluminum ware or if it should not stand in such ware and whether or not the food is really </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">standing,</span><span class="font5"> past a given time, in. the ware while ” being cooked. Many such questions will soon be asked by the laity and We should be able to answer them without confusion or hesitation. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">They should have the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. Alsaker states that no mercury enters into the foods that we cook, so the first .illustration in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">An Opinion Upon Aluminum,</span><span class="font5"> has nothing to do with cooking and should not he used as an illustration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">- The illustration is one which shows that, by placing or rubbing mercury upon an aluminum handle, an amalgam will be produced within a very few minutes, by the union of the aluminum with the mercury. This photograph was used as the first one in the book because it is of first importance. It deals directly -with the sick, with physicians, with hospitals. Varums aluminum companies are very proud of the fact and they state in their advertising that numberless hospitals use nothing but aluminum ware. Most hospitals have what they term “hospital routine”. This “routine” is practised with or without the physician’s consent. Many attendants or nurses give it to all patients unless otherwise instructed. That the reader may fully understand what this means to the patient I w’ill mention a recent case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The patient was presented for a slight operation, which ordinarily required about ten days’ stay at the hospital.. In this hospital the “routine” was to use calomel (mercury) at regular intervals for the purpose of bowel medication. The patient ate aluminum compounds in the food, which were dissolved from the aluminum kitchen utensils, and thus became directly mixed with the mercury either prescribed by the physician or given under “hospital routine”. The patient was detained about three weeks longer than the usual time required and the health condition from poisoning of the gastro-intestinal tract became so pronounced that great fear for his recovery took place. Extra medical counsel wfts obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was by accident that this writer overheard the order given to the nurse that this particular patient should have “hospital routine”.' Being only a dentist I inquired what that meant. I discovered that calomel (mercury) was the medicine used regularly for the “routine”. When this was discontinued, the patient became sufficiently well to leave the hospital within six days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Is it any it'oncler that we need more hospitals and all the physicians are busy, when mercury, which- becomes mixed with the various kinds of aluminum compounds formed from the hospital’s aluminum kitchen utensils, is &quot;besmeared” over the inside of the patients’ stomachs and bowels,</span><span class="font5"> instead of on a dental handle as photographed in the book? </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And this to happen at a time, of all times, when a person should have care?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I wish to call Dr. Alsaker’s attention to the fact that mercury (calomel) is extensively prescribed and that aluminum compounds in. hospital food do become mixed with it and the patient suffers from the results of such </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">amalgams </span><span class="font5">thus formed internally. The doctor states that even the bricks of which your homes are made are composed mostly of aluminum and that they almost surround and keep you comfortable in your homes. The doctor and myself are in perfect harmony upon that point, but I believe that when a human being eats the material of which bricks are made (i. e. aluminum) he often feels as if he actually has one in his stomach. I do not approve of using that organ for brickmaking or for otherwise digesting brick materials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the most prominent aluminum kitchenware manufacturers in the world, making “perfect” aluminum ware, made a thorough investigation of their own recently, I am informed. Directly after the examination they concluded to scrap their aluminum plant, which was done at a scrapping loss of about $4,000,000. So aluminum ware may not be fit to use for cooking purposes. Apparently they thought so. The reader can judge for himself, even though, to my knowledge, no public announcement was made of their findings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1916 the focal infection theory was given to the world, at the National Medical Convention in Detroit, Michigan. The focal infection theory is that pus from abscessed gums, roots of teeth and tonsils is absorbed by the body and that practically all diseases may be caused by such absorption. Many physicians do not believe that all our teeth should be extracted or that all our tonsils should be removed. However, after ten years of X-raying, extracting of the teeth, and removing of the tonsils, conditions in health have not improved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. J. P. Buckley, of Hollywood, California, believed that we should see some improvement in health conditions from such an extensive extracting orgy, or it was high time that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">intelligent men should call a halt.</span><span class="font5"> He challenged Dr. W. A. Price, of Cleveland, Ohio, to a debate upon the question. The debate was held in Chicago, before one thousand members of the Dental Society, November, 1925. Even to this day the focal infection theory is almost universally believed in and almost every patient calling for medical assistance must be X-rayed and thousands upon thousands have their teeth and tonsils removed. This has been the practice for twelve years, yet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">deaths</span><span class="font5"> by cancer have increased steadily at the rate of 2% per 100,000 per annum and many other diseases accordingly. Stomach, bowel, kidney and heart diseases have greatly increased during the last twenty years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This was so noticeable to Dr. Alsaker that he began to instruct people how to “eat right” and later became the editor of the magazine called </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Correct Eating.</span><span class="font6"> Dr. Alsaker now claims that </span><span class="font5">the increase of the above-named diseases is more fancied than real. If his statement is true, I believe the public is being cheated and the doctor is aware of the fact, when he sells his publications, because such papers would not be needed. It is my opinion that the public needs more publications like </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Correct, Eating,</span><span class="font5"> but the editors of such papers are human and may perhaps err at times. This occurred recently, in my opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">An Opinion upon Aluminum</span><span class="font5"> is a little thirty-six page pamphlet and it was my first literary effort. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Opinion</span><span class="font5"> was designed to cause an investigation of a poison I had found to be potent and dangerous to bodily health. I expected ridicule from such men as Dr. Morris Fishbein, Dr. would. Brady or Milo Hastings, but not from Dr. Alsaker. I thought he was one who would not be ashamed of his native state and would say frankly, T am from Missouri. I wish to investigate your crusade before I condemn it/ </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">This was not done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Removing the People’s Eyes and Brains</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font5">HE Reverend G. A. Studdert-Kennedy, 'who was an army chaplain in the World War, has the following to say as to how the people have their eyes and brains removed in time of war:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘ On the efficiency of the propaganda department everything else depends. At a moment’s notice, every nation must be ready with projectors to let loose upon the people clouds of poisonous lies. They must be made to weep with a slush .and sentiment, that they may not see; to choke with indignation and to cringe with fear, that they may not think. Strong but subtle irritants to stir them.to hatred must be invented. Years afterward the truth may come out, but the lies will have served their purposes and people soon forget. They will be just as ready to believe that Russians torture women as they were to believe that Germans melted down their dead for glycerin, if Russia should happen to be the enemy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The gentlemen whose business it is to see that the eyes and brains of the people are duly removed at their convenience are described in the following language by Alonzo B. Houghton, American ambassador to Great Britain:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“War does not originate from time to time simply in a sudden and uncontrollable impulse. War is possible because the masses are willing to fight. But these conditions are themselves an integral part of the problem. And that issue is the outcome of a series of maneuvers by which the masses concerned are brought into positions of opposition. Obviously, this maneuvering is not done by the masses themselves. Collectively and as individuals they have little if anything to do with the subtle and gradual -shifting of international relationships. Their interests are directed to the more humble </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font5">prosaic task of earning a living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The maneuvering is done by little groups of men called governments. These little </span><span class="font6">groups </span><span class="font5">seek constantly and naturally to gain supposed advantages of one sort and another for their own nationals. Out of their efforts to enlarge or to strengthen or to maintain the interests intrusted to their charge the masses they represent are gradually maneuvered into positions which, to say the least, can not easily be surrendered. If the process continues, sooner or later a situation arises in which an agreement between these small groups becomes impossible. Then, on the ground that their lives and families and property are somehow involved and endangered, these great masses of men and </span><span class="font6">wo</span><span class="font5">men, roused by every power of organized appeal and propaganda, are ordered under arms, and war follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The entire process is in control of the smaller groups. They make the issue. They declare the war. The masses they control simply obey.**</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Bible Questions and Answers</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">QUESTION:</span><span class="font5"> Please explain Jolin 17:11, “ </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">An</span><span class="font5">d now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given'me, that they may he one, as we are.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font5"> Jesus here recognized that His time on earth was short. When shortly He would leave the world, He made sure of the safe-keeping of His followers in the hands of His Father, Jehovah God. He also prayed that His followers might be one as Jesus and His Father were one. This unity consited in their whole-hearted devotion to the Father and His cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font5"> What becomes of the babies when they die? Are they eternally lost because they know not the Bible?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font5"> No. The babies are not lost. They remain in the graves until the time of awakening, when the dead shall come forth. The loving heavenly Father has a record of all the babes who went down to the tomb, and He will bring them forth through Christ Jesus. They will grow to manhood and womanhood upon the earth, coming to a knowledge of the truth in the kingdom; and being obedient they -will be given everlasting life upon this planet earth. The Lord gives all mothers who have lost babes words of encouragement in Jeremiah 31:15. A slaughter of infants had taken place in Ramah, and Rachel was weeping for her dead babes. Undoubtedly her relatives and friends had sought to comfort her, but their words did not comfort her. We read, “Thus saith the Lord, a voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not. [Of course if they were not, they were dead.] Thus saith the Lord, Re</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">frain thy voice from -weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded,!! saith the Lord: and they shall come again from the land of the enemy. And there is hope ird thine end, saith the Lord, that thy children shall come again to their own border.” Of course if) the children are promised to come again to their! own border, it means that they will return to the confines of the same land. This should gladJ den the heart of each mother who has lost al babe. The Lord’s word is the only comfort for! the heart-broken mother. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font5"> Please explain Ecclesiastes 12: 7 I which states, “Then shall the dust return, to the | earth as it was; and the spirit shall return unto I God who gave it.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font5"> This verse describes what takes I place at the death of an individual. The body j returns to the earth, and the breath or air which one breathes returns to the original place ! of the atmosphere created by God. This does ! not mean that man breathes out some animate j part of himself which lives on after death, j When a man dies, he dies as a soul. In Psalm ! 89:48 we read, “What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? Shall he deliver his : soul from the hand of the grave?” Again we read in Ezekiel 18:4, “The soul that sinneth, it shall die.” A person that goes dowrn into death remains dead until the time of the awakening of the dead in the resurrection process. It will be noted that wfliat occurs when a man dies is exactly the reverse process of w-hat took place at the time of creation. When the Lord created Adam it was by the following process, as described in Genesis 2: 7, “And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font5">HE clergy as a class claim to be followers of Jesus Christ, and make the people believe that they are. The Scriptures designate Jesus Christ as “The Prince of Peace”. When He was on earth He repeatedly declared the law which His followers must obey: “Thou shalt not kill.” Any one who is a true follower of i Jesus Christ must be obedient to this command. Any one claiming to be a follower of Christ and who at the same time urges men to kill each other is a hypocrite and party to the crime of the killing. There might be some excuse or extenuating circumstances for men who know nothing about the Bible to en-; gage in war, but there is no excuse or extenuating circumstances in favor of a Christian I voluntarily engaging in war or urging others to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the World War of 1914 to 1918 the clergymen advocated war, urged young men to go to war to kill their fellow men, used their ; church buildings for recruiting stations, and denounced and persecuted every one who expressed conscientious scruples against killing.</span></p>

The teacher that teaches them they have no right to bear arms for the state should be fired out of his position.” Dr. Cadman with others boasted of the fighting rector, Dr. Reiland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Massachusetts Clerical Association </span><span class="font6">was </span><span class="font5">one of the first to vote for America to enter the war. and a delegation of the prominent clergy visited Washington to combat the “unchristian influence” of pacifists. They made </span><span class="font6">it </span><span class="font5">their business to use their church buildings for the preaching of war sermons. When the government enacted the conscription law and inserted a section making it possible for a. Christian to decline active military service, nearly every clergyman in the land opposed those who took advantage of this provision </span><span class="font6">of </span><span class="font5">the law. They spoke of such men as “poor pussy-foot pacifists”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. S. E. Young, of the Presbyterian church, called them cowards and traitors because they expressed their belief in God and in Christ </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font5">insisted on obeying God rather than man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bishop Kinsolving, of Texas, declared that “such men should be driven not only from the country, but from the earth”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Reverend Howard Ganster, of Waukegan, Ill., “advocated the organization of a </span><span class="font6">so</span><span class="font5">ciety for the committing of murder of persons who do not stand up or who leave the building when the ‘Star Spangled Banner’ is played.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. .Henry van Dyke delivered a so-called sermon, and referring to a gentleman who would candidate for mayor in New York, and who was against America’s entering the war, said: “I would hang every one, whether or not he be a candidate for mayor, who lifts his voice against America’s entering the war.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Reverend Gillis, a Catholic, said: “Jesus Christ is the Prince of Peace, but Pontius Pilate was the Prince of Pacifists.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Dr. Eaton was made chairman of the National Service Section of the Emergency Fleet Corporation, and performed the duty of delivering light-talks in the shipyards. He said: “When a spy conies sneaking around with a bomb don't say, let us pray/' but take him out there on the marsh and tie him down and place the bomb on his chest. Light it and stand off and watch him blow to his Kaiser, to hell I Be regular he-men.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Evidently Eaton’s conscience hurt him so much after the war that he got himself elected to Congress from New Jersey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Reverend W. W. Bustard, John D. Rockefeller’s loyal servant, from his pulpit exclaimed : “To hell with the Kaiser!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. Newell D. Hillis, of Brooklyn, pastor of the Plymouth Church, was one of the most vehement advocates of .America’s entering the war. When the nation did enter the war, the American Bankers' Association sent forth Hillis as its missionary to preach war. He prepared the sermons which hundreds of thousands of other pastors delivered, urging young men into the trenches. When the war ended and millions were in sorrow because of what had happened, Dr. Hillis, instead of visiting the widows and orphans as the Scriptures command that a Christian shall do (James 1: 27), still continued to express his vindictiveness and venom against the helpless people of Germany who had been driven into the war by their war machine. Hillis said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Society has organized itself against the rattlesnake and the yellow fever. Shepherds have entered into a conspiracy to exterminate the wolves. The Boards of Health are planning to wipe out typhoid, cholera, and the black plague. Not otherwise, lovers of their fellow man have finally become perfectly hopeless with reference to the German people. They have no more relation to the civilization of 1918 than an orang-outang, a gorilla, a Judas, a hyena, a thumbscrew, or a scalping knife in the hands of a savage. These brutes must be cast out of society. . . . There will shortly be held a meeting of surgeons in this country. A copy of the preliminary call lies before me. The plan to be discussed is based upon the Indiana State law. That law authorizes a State Board of Surgeons to use upon the person of confirmed criminals and hopeless idiots the new painless method of sterilizing the men. These surgeons are preparing to advocate the calling of a world conference to consider the sterilization of 10,000,000 German soldiers and the segregation of their women, that when this generation of Germans goes, civilized cities, states and races may be rid of this awful cancer I that must be cut clean out of the body of society. I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No general, no man in the army, nor any I warlord ever gave utterance to such diabolical | and wicked words as those written by Hillis. I These clergymen are the ones who, with pious faces and sanctimonious words, tell the peoples i that their organized system of oppression and murder represents Christ on earth and therefore constitutes “organized Christianity”, or | “Christendom”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Reverend George Atwater directly linked the i so-called Christian church with the war. When the war was at its height lie said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The complete representative of the American Church in France is the United States Army overseas. Yes. an | army, with, its cannon and rifles and machine guns, I and its instruments of destruction. The Church mili- j taut, sent, morally equipped, strengthened and en- ■ couraged, approved and blessed, by the Church at home. The army today is the Church in action, transforming the will of the Church into deeds, expressing the moral judgment of the Church in smashing blows. Its worship has its vigil in the trenches, and its fasts and feasts; j its prayers are in acts, and its choir is the crash of | cannon and the thrilling ripple of machine guns. |</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the .House of Representatives at Washing- 1 ton, in January, 1918, the Reverend Billy Sun- | day was invited to deliver the morning prayer. ; He would make it appear that the Lord is as : bloodthirsty as some of the clergymen. He said: “Thou knowest, O Lord, that no nation so in- ! famous, vile, greedy, sensuous, bloodthirsty, ; ever disgraced the pages of history. Make bare ; Thy mighty arm, O Lord, and smite the hungry, wolfish Hun, whose fangs drip with blood, and we will for ever raise our voices in Thy praise.” t The newspapers recorded that when Sunday finished his harangue, for the first time in its history the House applauded a prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is not surprising then that Admiral Fiske, of the United States Navy, said: “The Chris- j tian religion is at this moment being made to | exert a powerful influence, not towards peace but towards war.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a true evidence that the political powers appreciated their allies the preachers, Secretary Lane said that “the war could not have been won without the churches”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">My point is this, gentlemen, that if the^ preachers wish to advocate war they should j cease claiming to be Christians preaching the j</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">May 15, 1928</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">gospel of peace and good will toward men. If they want to follow the Lord Jesus, they ought to be honest and tell the people what he taught, and cease being hypocrites. The clergymen in Germany and in Austria took a position identical with that taken by the clergymen in England and America in urging the people to engage in killing their fellow men. All of these preachers claim to worship the- same God. Tn fact, they do worship the same god, but not Jehovah God. They worship and fellow the god of this world, who is Satan the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font5">T IS not my purpose to light corporations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It would be useless for a man or even a number of men to fight these great giants. My pur</span><span class="font6">pose </span><span class="font5">and business is to call attention to the truth, that the people may see what is hypoc</span><span class="font6">risy </span><span class="font5">and may learn how real prosperity will </span><span class="font6">come </span><span class="font5">to them; also to show the people that the clergymen do not represent God and Christ, as </span><span class="font6">they </span><span class="font5">claim, but represent the great enemy Sa</span><span class="font6">tan. </span><span class="font5">For this reason it is necessary to look at </span><span class="font6">some </span><span class="font5">of their associates with whom they are </span><span class="font6">working.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A corporation is created and organized by the </span><span class="font6">law. </span><span class="font5">It is organized that it may continue per</span><span class="font6">petually. </span><span class="font5">Those who organize and control a corporation are usually selfish men who, like </span><span class="font6">other </span><span class="font5">men, sicken and die. A corporation, how</span><span class="font6">ever, </span><span class="font5">continues because men succeed each other </span><span class="font6">in office </span><span class="font5">of the corporation. A corporation, being an inanimate body, is of itself guilty of no </span><span class="font6">wrong. </span><span class="font5">It is used, however, by selfish men to </span><span class="font6">commit </span><span class="font5">wrong. The corporation itself produces </span><span class="font6">no </span><span class="font5">wealth. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">As</span><span class="font5"> a rule the men who manage it </span><span class="font6">produce </span><span class="font5">nothing. A corporation holds together that which selfish men by scheming bring into </span><span class="font6">its coffers. </span><span class="font5">Corporations could be used for </span><span class="font6">much </span><span class="font5">good if controlled and operated by men </span><span class="font6">who are moved </span><span class="font5">with an unselfish desire to help </span><span class="font6">their fellow </span><span class="font5">creature. Most of the men who con</span><span class="font6">trol </span><span class="font5">great corporations are lovers of money. ^The love of money is the root of ail evil.” </span></p>
<p><span class="font6">harsh, </span><span class="font5">cruel and oppressive. The corporation, once receiving its franchise, feels no obligation ^to the people and renders the people no favor </span><span class="font6">without </span><span class="font5">being highly paid therefor. It is true </span><span class="font6">that the people </span><span class="font5">receive some benefit from the </span><span class="font6">operation </span><span class="font5">of corporations; but if these mighty organizations were operated justly and unselfishly, being satisfied with a reasonable profit, the people would be greatly benefited. If they were not used to influence and control the polities of the country, the people would be saved from many burdens. The rule is that the men who organize and carry on great corporations are moved entirely by a selfish desire to acquire wealth and power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">HD HE farmers and laborers produce the food ■*- and raiment of mankind. This must be put into the hands of the consumer. Men establish stores whore the produce may be sold and where the consumer may purchase. For some time the merchant or storekeeper made a modest profit for his labor; the producer </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">got</span><span class="font5"> a reasonable price for his product; while the consumer bought at a reasonable price. The strong corporations came into the field. They have established what are called chain stores, which means they have a large number of stores throughout the land. They compel the producer to sell at a low price. How? you ask. They say to the producers: &quot;You may sell to the small buyer if You want to; but if you do, we will buy none of your products. We must have all or none.” For a time the corporations pay a reasonable price to the producer, even more than the small merchant. For a time they sell to the consumer at a loss, and until such, time that the small merchant is forced to close his doors. Then the corporations reduce the price to the producer, and raise the price charged to the consumer; and therefore the corporations, which own the chain stores, fix the prices of both the producer and the consumer, and force the small man out of business. These chain stores are operating throughout America and England. The purpose is to control the food supply of the earth while the selfish themselves grow wealthy. .Tn this connection I am reminded of what the Lord through his witness had to say; but I will call your attention to that later.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">HE people get some good from the banks, of course; but they pay for what they get, and then some. The small banks are gradually passing out. The wealth of the country is in-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">creasing. It should be expected that there would be more banks for the accommodation of the people. The facts show that in 1927 there were 524 fewer banks in the United States than in 1921. The big corporations are swallowing up the small banks. When the big banks control all the business of the country, then the people will have less consideration shown them, because there will be no competition, and selfishness will entirely control. The banks, being fewer in number and greater in power, can more easily control the business and the politics of the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Great and powerful banks pool their interests and loan money to nations or governments upon bonds issued, which the taxes of the people must pay. That scheme enables a few men to directly control the policy of the government. They make enormous profits in the transaction, but not because they have produced anything. The people produce the wealth, and a few selfish men wax rich by manipulating schemes to obtain and control it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Manipulating Stocks</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font5">LMOST all big corporations issue stocks and bonds, and put them on the stock exchange for sale. There are two classes of men that always operate on the stock exchange, called “bulls” and “bears”. They usually work together. The bulls manipulate the stocks and force them on a high market; and when they reach a high point they sell out to the gullible public, some of whom think they can make a fortune by gambling in stocks. Then the bears come to the fore, and they force the price of the stocks down. The gullible public become frightened and sell their stocks; and the big corporations buy them in at a low price. They constantly work this game at regular intervals; and as the old colored man said about his coon traps: “They ketch ’em, coming and going.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Fabulous Incomes</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">rpEN great corporations in the United States -*• have been in existence on an average of thirty-six years. The average annual dividends that they pay on watered stock are forty million dollars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The financial record in the United States</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Treasury’s office discloses that in one yea (1919) seventeen woolen mills made a cleai profit of 100 percent on their capital stock; </span><span class="font6">the  </span><span class="font5">corporations operating canning factories the can the fruit and vegetables produced by the hard labor of others in one year made a profit of 2932 percent; that clothing stores made a profit in one year of 9826 percent; that the aluminum trust, with a capital of only $20,000, it one year (1923) made a profit of 1000 percent</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Five big corporations in the United States have increased their assets fifty-five percent within five years.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“Service to the public.” One of these big corporations is the Consolidated Gas &amp;&nbsp;Electric Company. Its operations extend throughout:] many states in America. A portion of its se-| curities are sold to its employes and to thel public. These securities pay six percent. This,, like other big corporations, desires to get some of its securities into the hands of the public. There is a reason for this. You occasionally hear some small stockholder boasting and saying, “I hold some of the bonds of that corporation.” Another, who is drawing a small salary as a servant, says, “I have a big corporation back of me.” The corporation,, as the facts show, charges an exorbitant price for services rendered to the public. It uses the common people, who hold a small amount of the stock, io influence legislation in favor of themselves. A prominent financial journal is responsible </span><span class="font6">for </span><span class="font5">this statement: “Alarge utility corporation</span><span class="font6">haa </span><span class="font5">estimated that if ten percent of the citizens </span><span class="font6">of </span><span class="font5">a community own some of its securities </span><span class="font6">that </span><span class="font5">corporation is immune to adverse legislation.* That is the reason why the public serviceiilBl porations offer their securities for sale small, investors.

<p><span class="font6">The Princes in Christ’s Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">[Broadcast from Station WBBR, New York, by F. W. Franz.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">D</span><span class="font5">ID any of you ever see a prince? Very few of you have seen one, I feel sure. It is because we do not grow them over in this country, but to keep you from thinking that they are some wonderful kind of a creature let me say right here that earthly princes are just plain human beings like you and me, and no better than we are, either.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Maybe you have a dog and you call him Prince, but prince is what some countries call the son of a king. Take the oldest son of the King of England; he is called the Prince of ' Wales. But not all princes are sons of a king; sometimes the king or even the pope will honor some man by making him a prince because he has lots of money and helps the king, or because he is high up in the government and does something 'Tig” for his country, or the pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bible mentions princes. It does not think much of these earthly princes though. The poor people have been taught to look up to their princes as extraordinary persons; they were taught to think that their princes had a different kind of blood than the people had; “bluebloods” they would call the princes, as though that meant something wonderful. But the Bible says that God made everybody on this earth of one blood, and so nobody ought to swell up with pride because he thinks he is of royal or blue blood, as they say.—Acts 17:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bible also gives us good advice as to these earthly princes; it says: “Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.” “It is better to trust in the Lord, than to put confidence in princes.”—• Psalms 146:3: 118:9. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Princes ef </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">this World</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">W</span><span class="font5">HY does Ilie Bible speak this way about princes? It Is because human princes are just men of flesh and blood and having faults and imperfections like yourself. Besides this, these princes all belong to and are a part of the Devil’s..way of running this earth. Satan, God’s enemy, is the unseen ruler over them all and they are mixed up in his politics. Three times Jesus called Satan “the prince of this world” (John 12: 31: 14: 30; 16:1.1), and therefore Satan is the prince over all these princes. Some of-these princes nineteen hundred years ago were the ones who had Jesus put to death on </span><span class="font6">the cross.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">About this Paul, one of Jesus’ followers, says: “We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, . . . which none [think of it: not one] of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.” (1 Corinthians 2:7,8) That shows, doesn’t it? that these princes are not on God’s side; and if they are not on God’s side they must be on Satan’s side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But, you may say, that could not mean “the princes of the church” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">too,</span><span class="font5"> could it? Oh, I suppose you mean those fellows who claim to be God’s priests and who dress themselves up in scarlet and in rich long robes and who have a title tacked onto their name, and who have people tip their hats to them and kneel down before them and kiss their hand or the ring on their finger. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Well, the Bible nowhere says that there would be princes of the church, that is, of Jesus Christ’s true church, on this earth. You never read of Jesus dressing up that way: it was the soldiers who nailed him to a cross -who “put on him a scarlet robe”, to make fun of him.—Matthew 27:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Neither did Jesus speak well of religious people who showed themselves off by wearing long mors and who had people call them by titled names as though they were above the rest of the people. Jesus said: “Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues [churchesJ, and the chuff rooms at feasts; . . . and for a shew make long prayers.” (Luke 20:46,47) In those days in which, as well as women, wore gowns, and if Jesus talked that tvay then, what would he say today when men are supposed to wear trousers instead of skirts like ladies?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Surely you children can easily see that these fellows, called “'princes of the church”, are not imitating Jesus but are doing just the things that Jesus said his learners should not do. If these princes are not obeying Jesus, then whom, must they be following? Maybe you're a little afraid to say, but there is only one other person they could be obeying, and that must be the one whom Jesus called “the prince of this world”. They are princes in “this world”, aren’t</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">639 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">'enoo’n™. x X</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">they? therefore they must be under “the prince of this world”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now do not be surprised at this, because if you will look into the Bible you will find that mn&gt; of the “princes of this world” who crucified Jesus, the Lord of glory, claimed to he priests of God. But although they dressed up and acted like priests, they did not really serve God, did they? So I do not believe we can leave out any of the princes on tills earth, not even these men called “princes of the church”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Do you know, though, that there will be princes </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">on</span><span class="font5"> this carrh when Jesus’ kingdom has bound the devil for a thousand years and when there is no other such thing as a kingdom on this s-arlh but Christ's kingdom? The Bible tells us there will. he.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Turn in your Bibles to the book of Psalms, and look up the 43th Psalm. There it tells us about King Jesus and about His queen who is the true church. After telling about the queen and her bridesmaids, this Psalm goes on to say in the 16th verse: “Instead of thy fathers shall he thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.” Now w<sup>r</sup>ho will these princes he? After all the Bible has to say you may be sure that the princes of this world will not be the princes under Jesus the King. No, not at ail, because God’s prophet Zephaniah (1:8) says: “It shall come to pass in the day of the Lord’s sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king’s children, and all such as are clothed with strange apparel,” such as clergy : .skirts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bible seems to show that God’s throne in heaven is in what we call the north, very likely near the stars called the Pleiades (Job - 38:31); and speaking about how he will raise up Jesus as King to turn the Devil’s kingdom upside down and break it to pieces, God says: “I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come: from the rising of the sun shall he' call upon my name: and he shall come- upon princes as upon mortar, and as the potter tread upon clay.” When King Jesus gets through treading down these princes of this world, so to speak, they’ll surely not be princes any more, will they?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of course, His name was not Jesus when. </span><span class="font6">He • </span><span class="font5">was up in heaven. Jesus was the name </span><span class="font6">that </span><span class="font5">God’s angel told Joseph and Mary to name him when He was born in the stable in Bethlehem. Jesus’ name in heaven was Michael, which means ‘-'one like God”. No one was more like God than He, nor ever will bo. The Bible speaks of Him as “Michael, the great prince* (Daniel 12:1; 10:13, 21), and for the best reason in the world. You see, Jesus called God His Father “the great King” (Matthew 5:35), and since- He was the only begotten Son of God “the great King” he would bo a “great prince”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Jesus stands up in His power as God's King over the pebi.de of this earth, then a great time of trouble comes because the Devil and all the people whom the Devil has made kings and princes and rulers on this earth do not want Jesus to rule as king hut want to rule the earth and the people themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Speaking of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">that time an</span><span class="font5"> angel </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font5"> Gud told the Prophet Daniel these words: “And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people; and there shall he a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus will not allow the Devil and the rulers of the people of this earth to keep on, but will bind the Devil a thousand years and then destroy him (Revelation 20:1-10), and He will ' also put the princes and princesses and other rulers out of their high jobs or positions. The great time of trouble began fourteen years ago, in the year 1914, when we had a great World</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">many kings and princes have been killed or have lost their jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The great trouble is not over as yet, for Jesus told us that “the worst is yet to come* . (Matthew 24:7, 8, 21, 22); but by the time it is over, all of earth’s princes and rulers and kingdoms will be put out of the way, that Jesus alone might be King over the people. (Haggai 2:2,7,21,22) Then no more wars will be al- j lowed, but, Jesus will bring in peace tliat will come to stay. That is why He is called “The Prince of Peace”........Isaiah 9:6.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">earth out of those whom God wants. Who will they be? you ask. Christians? </span><span class="font6">No, </span><span class="font5">all </span><span class="font6">real</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">true Christians will have died by the time this i great trouble is over and will be raised from I the dead as heavenly persons and will sit down as kings with Jesus on His throne up in heaven. They will rule with Him over this earth i for </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font5">thousand years. (Revelation 20:3,6) i They will not stay living on this earth as human </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font5"> beings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">] Who then will be the ones whom Jesus will i make “princes in all the earth’’? Well, these people are not living today; they are dead just i now, but at the right time God will use Jesus f to raise them from the dead and make them i princes in the kingdom. Yes, you say, but do i tell who they will be!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">J Well, Psalm 45, verse 16, tells us that they will be men who wc<sup>j</sup>re once looked upon as be-ixig Jesus’ fathers; and when He makes them j princes, then instead of their being His fathers they will be His children. How funny! you say; H how could that ever be? The Bible tells us how. 1 Father means one who gives life to some one | else, and all those whom God raises from the | dead 'will get their life through Jesus, because | He died for us all on the cross. Jesus will not | be like our earthly father^ who sometimes die | off before we do and leave us fatherless, neither | will Jesus give us life that lasts only for a little I while, as our earthly fathers do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I Jesus lives everlastingly and He will give | everlasting life to all the people who will do | what God wants for them to receive it. That is - why He is called “the everlasting Father”. And ■‘hat &lt;oo is why those that Jesus brings back 1 from the dead and makes princes wall be the ‘ children of Jesus and He will be their everlast-</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">j</span><span class="font5"> ing Father.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">AVID, the shepherd boy who killed the <sub>{</sub> giant Goliath with a slingshot and who be-( came king over the Jews, was spoken of as one of the fathers of Jesus. Of course, God was i and is really the only Father that Jesus ever i had, but you see King David was one of the | forefathers of Mary, Jesus’ mother, and that is i </span><span class="font6">why </span><span class="font5">Jesus was called “the son of David”.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Matthew 22:</span><span class="font6">41-46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You will also remember Abraham, who was ready to obey God and kill his beloved son Isaac and offer him as a sacrifice on the fire, but was stopped just in time by God’s angel.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">Well, this Abraham was also called one of the fathers of Jesus, and Jesus was called “the seed [or son] of Abraham”. This was also because Abraham was one of King David's forefathers and one of Mary’s forefathers. AH God’s holy and faithful prophets, such as John the Baptist, whose head was chopped off in prison, were also spoken of as fathers. Speaking to the Jews (and Jesus on earth -was a Jew) the Apostle Peter said: “Ye are the children of the prophets”—Acts 3:25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Apostle Paul, who wrote that book of the Bible which is called “Hebrews”, gives us. the names of quite a few of these godly and faithful people whom. King Jesus will make princes over the people. In the eleventh chapter of this book Paul mentions Abel, who was killed by his wicked brother Cain; and Enoch, who suddenly disappeared and was not to be found any<sup>: </sup>longer by the wicked people among whom he lived; and Noah, who built the ark house boat for his family and the animals to save them from the flood ; and Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and Moses, and Samuel, and many others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To show that these particular ones will bo made princes during God’s kingdom on this earth, Jesus said to the people of His time: “Yu shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom, of God, and you yourselves thrust out.” (Luke 13:28) For those people that lived then to see this they will have to come back from the dead and the grave, and so also will Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the faithful prophets. And they will; and the Bible strongly seems to show that they will make the place where Jerusalem is now located their headquarters. The Prophet Isaiah (2:2-4) said: “Out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Very likely many of you children will live through the great time of trouble and still be alive when God raises these good people from the dead. Then you may be able to hear their voices speaking by radio from Jerusalem, or you may even take an airship and pay a visit to Jerusalem and see these noble princes of. Christ’s kingdom for yourself. What is more: if you begin to get ready now </span><span class="font6">and obey the </span><span class="font5">King, Jesus, then you may </span><span class="font6">bo given some good </span><span class="font5">work to do to help- these princes. That will please and glorify the Lord </span><span class="font6">God </span><span class="font5">and will </span><span class="font6">be for </span><span class="font5">good to the people of </span><span class="font6">this earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Perfect Princes</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■</span><span class="font5">OU may be sore that these prophets and faithful people who lived before Jesus died</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Bible also seems to say (Hebrews do come back they will not only be good-hearted but will have perfect bodies and minds and will not be likely to make mistakes. For that reason all the people on earth may expect them to be really and truly ‘'perfect princes’, who will never do them' any wrong but only do them good and help them back to God and to bring paradise again on earth. Telling about how these princes of Christ’s kingdom will rule the people, God’s holy Book says: ‘‘Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.” “My princes shall no more oppress my people.”—Isaiah 32:1; Ezekiel 45: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These good princes are one of the things you pray for when you pray the Lord’s prayer: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Piffle and Bunk Department</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■</span><span class="font5"> E HAVE two clippings from the piffle and bunk department of the Cincinnati </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Po?t </span><span class="font5">of February 14,1928. A mother wants to know what has become of her dead son, and instead of felling her the Scriptural trath that ho is as dead as a doornail until the resurrection, the Beverend Doctor S. Parkes Cadman, president of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America, gives the poor woman the following lines for which there is not a shred of evidence in the Bible or elsewhere, and in wliieh there is not a syllable of truth:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">earthly tribulations. His mind is undimmed by the delusions of the flesh. He in that high world of self's rebellion, his choices his service is complete and blessed in motive as in deed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">his spiritual evolu-..........the......society......■S Mndred souls and has that L-y#^S3t^S®^Ml^Hhessi5vhieh St. Paul declared and Dante could not sufficiently express.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">.Lastly, I believe»»She'*mfetakes and sins of the past are forgotten, but not the one who gave him birth, nor during his stay here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The semi that rose within him as he lay in your arms was elsewhere its trailing clouds of glory. There he. awaits rejoin him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the other clipping, </span><span class="font5">from the same payer, the same, date, and the same user of words which have no meaning, we have the following brilliant answer as to what became of two seamen, not Christians, and therefore heathen, and therefore without God, who died while endeavoring to save the lives of others. Note the complete absence of the need of Christ in the answer to this question, as in the one that preceded it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Speaking broadly, it is inconceivable to me that a brave man who dies in trying to save life should be condemned to everlasting punishment. It is also equally incredible that he proceeds at once to perfect character and happiness. The seaman who gives his life for another may be too good for hell, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">but it</span><span class="font3"> requires more than one gallant and self -sacrificing act to make him fit for heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The transformation of human nature is an extended process. Obviously it is seldom completed hero, even in the best of men and women. We are shut up to the conclusion that it must be completed elsewhere. There we are, to know as we are known and to make the will of God and our desire one steady stream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If the two splendid fellows you mention expressed their essential selves in their deed, who dare doubt their divine destiny ? But the argument still remains that both paradise and perdition are made by the exalted nature which no solitary act, however sacrificial, can fully </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">express.</span><span class="font3"> Not an occasional impulse, but our total being determines the future life, and that being always gravitates toward its own place in both worlds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Children’s Own Radio Story </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Story Five</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font12">W</span><span class="font5">HEN the Logos was made flesh and was born of the line of David nineteen hundred years ago, the very tirst visitors the babe had, as lie lay in the manger of the little inn where Joseph and Mary had stopped all night, were some poor shepherds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No kings, nor princes, nor dukes, presidents, barons, nor nobles of any sort were there to crowd around the young Savior and do 'Him homage. Just a few simple-hearted, loving men, whose humble occupation was tending sheep upon the hillsides near Bethlehem. But these men had the love of God in their hearts, and their prompt attention to the notice which the angel of the Lord gave them was no doubt very pleasing to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are told of this in Luke 2:10-18. “And They came with haste, and found Mary, and IJoseph, and the babe lying in a manger. And I when they had seen it, they made known abroad tthe saying which was told them concerning this jchild. And all they that heard it wondered at phose things which were told them by the shep-Iherds.” Then, in verse 20 of the same chapter we read: “And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising. God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.<sup>55</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">i As soon as the child Jesus was old enough to make the journey, Mary and Joseph brought Him to Jerusalem, to the temple of the Lord. According to the law of Jehovah which was given to Moses long ago, the firstborn child, if a boy, was considered as holy to the Lord, and was taken into the temple of the Lord at Jerusalem to be presented before the altar of the great Jehovah. Jesus was Mary’s first child, of course, and therefore it was necessary to take Him before the altar of the Lord and observe the rules which Jehovah had. made concerning this act of worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now a very interesting event in connection with the presenting of Jesus in the temple, was this: There lived in Jerusalem at that time a man whose ways pleased the Lord. His name was Simeon. Jehovah was pleased with this man, and told him, through the agency or power of His holy spirit, that Simeon should not see death before he had seen the Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So Simeon lived on and on, joyful in the hope</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">of one day beholding </span><span class="font6">with his own eyes the </span><span class="font5">Savior of the </span><span class="font6">world. Thus it happened, that </span><span class="font5">when Simeon </span><span class="font6">was quite an old man, the holy </span><span class="font5">spirit or power of </span><span class="font6">God came upon </span><span class="font5">him </span><span class="font6">and di</span><span class="font5">rected his footsteps to </span><span class="font6">the temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There he found the child Jesus, and those who had just brought Him thither. Mary and Joseph. And then Simeon took the little child Jesus in his arms, and blessed God, ami rejoiced, saying, “Lord, now lettest thou, thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word: for mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared before the face of all the people.<sup>55</sup>—Luke 2: 29-31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That is another instance of the truth </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font5">honor of Jehovah God. He promised Simeon years before that he should not die until he had seen Christ. And because Jehovah God is allwise, perfect, just, and kind, He kept His word, and Simeon </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">did</span><span class="font5"> see the child Jesus, the Christ, and even held the holy babe in his arms. Have we not great cause to be thankful for such </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font5">God as that, whom to know aright is to love with all our hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now, up to this point in our radio stories we have learned about the Word, or Logos, who we know was used of God to create all things in heaven and earth. We know that because father Adam disobeyed God, God sentenced him to death, and all his children partook of his condemnation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since we are Adam’s children too, it is very important to ns to know whether we have any chance of coming back from death and living for ever. Such a chance is to be given to us, through the great and wonderful benevolence of God and His Son, the Logos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To make a corresponding or equal price for the perfect life that Adam forfeited when he disobeyed God, the Logos or mighty Son of God has offered Himself, as a perfect human being, to the heavenly Father. Jehovah has accepted that sacrifice, for He not only loves His own Son, but He also loves us. Through this great love for His creatures, then, the Lord Christ Jesus became a man and suffered death to redeem us from everlasting death. We shall next learn about the events in the life of Jesus from the time He was brought into the temple until He became a man.</span></p>
