<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WATCH TOWER BIBLE and TRACT SOCIETY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is a corporation created and organized under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania for the purpose of carrying on an educational work amongst the people. It is devoted to giving instruction in the Bible. It was originally organized in 1884. Its official residence is Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Since 1909 it has maintained its main operating office at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Peoples Pulpit Association is a membership corporation organized and created under the laws of the State of New York. Its purposes are identical with that of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society and its organization is for the purpose of aiding and carrying on the work for which the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society was organized. It was organized in the year 1909 and maintains its official residence at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The International Bible Students Association is a corporation created and organized under the laws of England with its official residence at 34 Craven Terrace, London, England. It is also an associate organization of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society organized to more efficiently carry on the educational work concerning the Bible. It maintains its main operating office at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These three corporations have the same president. The other officers are practically the same. They all work</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">7</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">in conjunction with each other, and the three separate corporations are maintained for convenience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The term International Bible Students is a generic one which applies to all consecrated and anointed Christians throughout the earth who work together harmoniously in the proclamation of the message of God’s plan. In many towns and cities in various nations there are classes or ecclesias; that is to say, men and women who assemble themselves together in an orderly way for Bible study and to work together systematically for the spreading of the message of God’s kingdom on earth. These various organizations or classes recognize the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society and its associate corporations as instruments for the carrying on of the Lord’s work amongst his people on earth. The official paper or journal of the organization is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font3"> published twice each month at Brooklyn, New York. It contains usually a leading article discussing some important Bible question. This article is used regularly as a text for Berean study of the many classes of International Bible Students. It also contains lectures or brief discussions of Bible questions suitable for broadcasting or otherwise for use at public meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The term “The Society” is used as a general term to represent all of the consecrated and anointed Christians on earth who are harmoniously working together in the promulgation of God’s message to the peoples of earth. The above corporations are not the Society, but said corporations are the servants of the Society. Those associated therewith believe that the Lord is using the Society, composed of his anointed people, as his witnesses on earth to declare specifically the following things, to wit: That Jehovah is God; that Christ Jesus is King and God has set him upon his throne; that the kingdom of heaven is at hand, and that through this kingdom all the families of the earth will have an opportunity for blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The above organization diligently seeks to cooperate with consecrated Christians in performing the work above mentioned. There is no membership Toll, members are not sought, but all are welcome who believe the great truths taught by the Scriptures and who honestly and earnestly engage in the Lord’s service.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark3"></a>TEACHINGS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">As an evidence that the Society is strictly adhering to proclaiming the message of God’s Word as taught by Jesus, the holy prophets, and the apostles, there is set forth herein an epitome of the truths so taught, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That Jehovah is the only true God; that his name has been pushed aside by so-called Christians for many centuries; that the Devil has blinded even Christians to the truth concerning him; that the world is totally blind; that the time has now come for God to make for himself a name in the earth and he commands his people, as his witnesses, to proclaim his truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That the Bible is the inspired Word of God, and that it contains a statement of the divine plan for man’s salvation and blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That the great fundamental truths prominently set forth in the Bible are these: Adam, the first man, was created perfect in organism and endowed with the faculties of wisdom, justice, love and power; that he wilfully violated God’s law in order to join his wife Eve in the transgression which Satan had induced her to commit; that the Lord God justly sentenced to death and expelled him from Eden; that all of his children were thereafter begotten and born, and that hence they were begotten in sin and brought forth in iniquity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That God made promise that through the seed of Abraham he would bless all the families of the earth, and that in due time he would redeem man from death and ransom him from the power of the grave; that he would raise up a mighty ruler unto whom the people shall be gathered; that in due time he sent to earth his beloved Son, who died upon the cross, whom God raised up from the dead and who by his death and resurrection provided the great redemptive price for mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That since the death and resurrection of our Lord, beginning with Pentecost, the Lord has been selecting the members of the body of Christ; and that these, Jesus the Head, and his body members, constitute the &quot;seed of promise” according to the promise which God made to Abraham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That Christ Jesus taught his followers to pray for the coming of God’s kingdom that God’s will might be done on earth as in heaven, and he promised that he would return in due time and set up his kingdom; that the great hope of the church from Pentecost forward has been the second coming of the Lord, the completion of the church and the inauguration of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That God’s provision for one becoming a member of the church, which is the body of Christ, is this, to wit: Belief in Christ Jesus as the great Redeemer of mankind ; a full consecration to do God’s holy will; justification of the one consecrating, which justification is oh-tained by the act of Jehovah in justifying or determining that one is right with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That justification by faith during the Christian era is for just one purpose and that is that the one justified may be a part of the sacrifice of the Lord, hence such have made a covenant with the Lord by sacrifice; that then God begets such an one by his spirit to the divine nature and inducts him into the body of Christ and anoints him; that thereafter such Christian must perform his part of the covenant faithfully unto death, and that thus doing he will receive full membership in the body of Christ and an abundant entrance into the heavenly kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That when Jesus was on earth his disciples propounded to him the question as to what would be the proof of his presence and the end of the world; that his answer was couched in prophetic phrase; that he gave a statement of conditions that would exist at the time of the end of the age and the setting up of his kingdom, to wit, the World War, famines, pestilences, revolutions, return of the Jews to Palestine, the persecution of Christians, and then a period in which the gospel of the kingdom must be proclaimed to all the nations as a witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That the proof shows that the Gentile Times ended in 1914; that there God, according to his promise, set his anointed King, Christ Jesus, upon his throne (Psalm 2:6); that there followed a great conflict in heaven between Christ on one side and Satan on the other, in which Satan was cast out of heaven; that since then the Lord has come to his temple and is now strengthening his people for the final experiences on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That soon will come the great time of trouble foretold by God through his prophets, and specifically mentioned by the Lord, which shall result in the complete destruction of Satan’s empire and the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth; that then unrighteous men shall cease to rule the world, and the world shall be established in righteousness that it shall never be moved. —Psalm 96:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That the reign of Christ will be for the purpose of granting to every one of the human race, both dead and living an opportunity for life, and that to this end all those who have died in ignorance of God shall be awakened and given a knowledge of the truth; that the church alone participates in the first resurrection; that all the families of the earth shall have an opportunity to know the Lord and to obey him, and that those obeying shall be granted the blessings of life everlasting in peace and happiness upon the earth for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Bible Students believe that the only reason for their being on earth at this time, and the only excuse for the existence of their organization, is that they might be witnesses that Jehovah is God and that his kingdom is at hand. The Devil for so long a time has blinded the people to God’s truth that now the time has come for God to make for himself a name. He will have his people bear testimony of him to the world, and then will follow the great conflict which shall mark the final end of earth’s wicked organizations; that such trouble is not a fight in which the Christian shall participate, but it is a fight of God Almighty against the Devil’s organization; and that the part to be performed by the Christians on earth is to faithfully represent the Lord by telling others of God’s purposes, and thereby to show forth his praises. The Bible Students are earnestly attempting to do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The International Bible Students Association is not seeking membership and has no membership roll. All who believe in the truths taught by Jesus and the apostles, and who now believe in the presence of the Lord and that the time has come for him to set up his kingdom, and who desire to participate, and to the best of their ability and opportunity do participate in giving the witness to the name of Jehovah, are counted in as members of the Association or Society. All such, in obedience to the admonition of the Apostle Paul, are standing shoulder to shoulder, fighting for the gospel of Jesus Christ and never quailing before the enemy. These have entered into the joy of the Lord; namely, seeing that the time has come for the establishment of the kingdom and the vindication of Jehovah’s name, it gives them great joy and delight to tell this good news to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Bible Students, in the performance of what they understand to be their covenant and in diligently trying to be witnesses for Jehovah, are now doing their part to hold up the standard of the Lord to the people, to remove the false doctrines that have stumbled the people and point the people to God’s great way of returning to him, and thereby are bringing consolation to all those who desire to be free. Believing that the time has come when a witness must be given to the kings and rulers of the earth, as well as to the peoples, they are earnestly putting forth their best efforts, gladly spending what little money they have and also spending their time and energy in spreading amongst mankind the good news that Jehovah is God, that Christ Jesus is the King of kings and Lord of lords, that God has set him upon his throne and that he bids all the peoples of earth to give heed to his message and to render obedience to his rule. It is now the privilege and joy of the Bible Students to make known to Christian peoples and to all peoples of good will that the kingdom, for which Jesus taught his followers to pray, is here; and therefore with gladness they are declaring that the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark5"></a>ANNUAL MEETING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Pursuant to notice duly given as provided by law and the charter and by-laws of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, a corporation created and organized under the laws of Pennsylvania, the annual meeting of said corporation was held at Carnegie Hall, Allegheny, Pittsburgh, at 10 a. m., October 31, 1927.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The meeting was called to order by the president and opened with prayer. There were present at said meeting the officers and a number of shareholders of the Society. Reading of the minutes of the previous meeting was dispensed with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The president presented to the corporation his annual report. The report being voluminous, it was not deemed wise to read it all. Excerpts were taken from the report, and a general statement made concerning the work throughout the field. The report was unanimously approved by members of the corporation and was ordered printed in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font3"> for the year 1928. The report follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To the Lord’s Anointed in the Earth :</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As president of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society it is my privilege to submit to the people of the Lord, on earth, the report that follows. I first call attention to the Scriptures showing why Christians are engaged in any work on earth, and then to the work that the anointed ones are doing in the name of Jehovah and of his beloved Son upon the earth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>GOD’S ORGANIZATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Sing praises to the Lord, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.&quot;—Psalm 9:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">M</span><span class="font3">ANY professed Christians have difficulty in understanding why the Bible Students are so persistent in their efforts to tell others about the kingdom of God. Frequently the question is propounded: Why do the Bible Students continue to call upon the people with books and other Bible literature and try to induce them to read ? Is it an effort on their part to make money and to get converts? Is the purpose to make their organization strong in the earth? True Christians should always be able to give a Scriptural reason for what they are doing. It seems appropriate that answers to the above questions be here given. First, let the questions propounded be answered in the negative. The Bible Students are making no effort to convert the world nor to acquire money nor to increase the organization in numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The words of the Psalmist quoted in the above text are prophetic. At some time they must have a fulfilment. The prophecy states that Jehovah dwells in Zion, and that some are to sing forth his praises and tell the people of his great doings. From the words of the Psalmist this song of praise is not to be given in heaven but on the earth, for the reason that it is to proclaim Jehovah’s name to the people and tell of his marvelous works. The people are on the earth; therefore the declaration must be made on the earth. It is also manifest that the class which fulfils this prophecy must be in complete harmony with Zion and joyfully carry out the commandments.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark9"></a>ZION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">An understanding of what is meant by Zion and what relationship the true Christians bear thereto will enable one to more clearly understand what is the duty of a Christian at this time. It should also make clear what constitutes God’s organization. Zion is the name of God’s organization. Zion is symbolized by a city. Jerusalem, a city, was a symbol of God’s people; while Zion more particularly represented those people of God forming a part of the city and who were charged with special duties and responsibilities. There was a Zion in picture. There is a Zion in reality. The former foreshadowed the latter. God chose Israel as his people, established them in the city of Jerusalem, made Zion the official part of that organization, city or people, and put his name upon that people and charged them with certain responsibilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Head of real Zion, which constitutes God’s organization, is his beloved Son Christ Jesus. He is the foundation of that organization, as it is written: “Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.”—Isaiah 28:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those who are begotten and anointed by the power of God and thereby brought into Christ are united to the foundation stone and become a part of God’s organization. (1 Peter 2:5-9) As long as they remain faithful and true to the Lord they continue a part of God’s organization. Many may claim to be the Lord’s; but only those are of his organization who have covenanted to do his will, and who are endeavoring so to do. In order to continue in his organization all such must be obedient to God’s commands. It is written: “Be ye clothed with humility; for God resisteth the proud, and showeth favor to the humble.” Humility means a willing and joyful obedience to the commandments of the Lord. The conditions for final exaltation require full obedience, which means to be clothed with humility. (1 Peter 5:5, 6) God’s organization therefore consists of those who are in full harmony with him and members of the body of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has chosen Zion for himself, which means that he uses Zion for his own purposes. “Pot the Lord hath chosen Zion: he hath desired it for his habitation.” (Psalm 132:13) Again, it is written: “His dwellingplace [is] in Zion.” (Psalm 76:2) Jehovah has put his name there, and he will use Zion for his purpose. Therefore Zion is God’s organization. To remain a part of Zion one must be at peace and in harmony with God and joyfully obey his commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is Zion that produces and gives birth to the kingdom of God, which is to be God’s righteous government on earth for the benefit of man. The time of the birth of that new nation must be the time when God installs Christ Jesus as king. “Yet I have installed my king, on Zion my holy mountain.” (Psalm 2: 6, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham) </span><span class="font3">From the time Jesus ascended on high and until God installs him as king, the Scriptures show that he awaits God’s command to take action against the enemy, the Devil and his organization. Christ the King is the rod of strength sent forth out of Zion to reign. (Psalm 110:1, 2) Since the kingdom is to be for men and men must be brought to a knowledge of the truth, it follows that there must be some representatives of Zion on earth. Some part of God’s organization, which is called Zion, must function on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It must be true, then, that a part of God’s organization is invisible, while there is some part of it visible to man; and that this condition must continue until the last member of the royal family is taken from earth and glorified. If we can ascertain from the Scriptures definitely what God requires of Zion on earth, and then if we can find an orderly body of men and women on the earth fulfilling these Scriptural requirements, undoubtedly we should be able to determine who on earth constitutes God’s organization. If we are thus able to locate God’s organization on earth, then all who are properly and sincerely devoted to the Lord and who love him will diligently strive to be in harmony with that organization.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark11"></a>REQUIREMENTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Concerning Zion it is written: “The Lord is great in Zion, and he is high above all the people.” (Psalm 99:2) To those who are members of Zion, God is great beyond all others and there is none to compare with him. Again it is written by God’s prophet: “Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.” (Psalm 50:3) That does not mean that those of Zion who are on earth shine, but it does mean that they make the name of God to shine by declaring his honor and praise to others. This conclusion is corroborated by the words of the Psalmist: “Sing praises to the Lord, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.” (Psalm 9:11) To the same effect it is written: “Blessed be the Lord out of Zion.” That means that those of Zion will be blessing and praising the name of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Apostle Peter, after telling of the laying of the chief corner stone of Zion in completion and how the true followers of Christ as living stones were made to conform to that chief corner stone, then says of and concerning them: “But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.” —1 Peter 2: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These scriptures positively prove that it is required of the members of Zion on earth to show forth the praises of God. They are called and put into positions in Zion for that purpose. If they love the Lord God, they will keep his commandments and will be unselfishly devoted to him; and this is required in order to continue in Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Furthermore, God says to those on earth who are of Zion: “Ye are my witnesses, that I am God.” (Isaiah 43:12) This scripture requires that the members of Zion on earth give testimony to the fact that Jehovah is the only true God and beside him there is none other, and the further fact that his kingdom is his means of blessing the human family. Thereby they show forth his praises in order to glorify his name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark13"></a>WHO FULFILS REQUIREMENTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The Scriptures show that God set his beloved Son upon his throne in 1914. This is fully corroborated by the physical facts in fulfilment of prophecy. Then followed the war in heaven, in which Satan was cast out to the earth. Further Scriptural proof and the physical facts show that the Lord came to his temple in 1918, which marks the time that he places his approval upon those whom he found faithfully attending to the interests of his kingdom. These he invited to enter into the joy of the Lord. (Matthew 25:21) The prophet shows that these are they who constitute the members of Zion on earth. Through the prophet the Lord says to them: “Awake, awake; put on thy strength, 0 Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, 0 Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.” (Isaiah 52:1) This would clearly indicate that the members of Zion would be awakened to a realization of greater responsibility and greater privileges in carrying out the will of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The prophet of God also shows that at this time these members of Zion were brought under the robe of righteousness and given the garments of salvation and did enter into the joy of the Lord and greatly rejoiced. (Isaiah 61:10) This scripture means that they received the approval of the Lord for faithfulness up to that time; that they were able, by the witness of the holy spirit, the Scriptures, and the Lord’s dealing with them, to identify themselves with the saved class. To continue in that favored position requires thereafter continued obedience. This continued obedience would afford greater opportunities of service to the glory of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After the Lord’s coming to his temple the true followers of Christ on earth began to realize the time of the fulfilment of these scriptures relative to this favored position of the members of the body of Christ. They also recognized that the World War and the attending events from its beginning up to its end were proof of the Lord’s coming and the end of the world and the time for the establishment of the kingdom. They then realized the importance of the command of the Lord when he said: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall the end come.”—Matthew 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then they began a strenuous campaign to carry out this commandment to advertise the King and the kingdom. From that time forward they continued to carry the good news to the Jews and to the nations of earth, telling them of the goodness of Jehovah and his beloved King and the kingdom. Again God through his prophet designates such faithful ones on earth as members of Zion when he said: “0 Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; 0 Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!”—Isaiah 40: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The prophet also shows that these same faithful Christians constitute the feet members of Christ; that is to say, his last members on earth doing his work under the direction of Christ Jesus the Head. The same prophet also identifies them as a part of Z.ion or that part which is on earth. “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth! Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing; for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion.”—Isaiah 52: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In view of these corroborative and harmonious scriptures it is not presumptuous for the Bible Students to say that there is no other organization on earth which is wholly and exclusively devoted to giving glory to the name of Jehovah and proclaiming the message and the plan of salvation. It is not boasting for them to claim that the true and faithful Christians who are engaged in this work in obedience to God’s command constitute Zion on earth. It is not to be understood that everyone who claims to be of the International Bible Students Association is of Zion. The Lord knows them that are his. We can, however, with safety and propriety say that every true Christian on earth who is working harmoniously with his brethren of like precious faith and in the name of Jehovah to proclaim his King and kingdom by carrying the message of truth to the people, constitutes Zion on earth. It is our understanding, therefore, when we speak of the Society, that the Society, as God’s organization, is properly called Zion on earth; that it is the organization upon which God has put his name; and that it is made up of the true and faithful followers of the Lord Jesus Christ, who are now fearlessly and lovingly obeying God’s commands in singing forth his praises and announcing his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Zion, that “faithful and wise servant”, the temple class on earth, and the Society, within the meaning of the above scriptures, are the same and are composed of the same people. It is not for one to judge another as to whether or not he is of this class; but it is the privilege of each one to judge himself and measure himself according to the Scriptures and determine whether or not he is of Zion. Those who conclude, in the light of the Scriptures and the facts, that they are of Zion realize that tills is the day of the Lord in which the Lord is beginning to manifest his power in the earth and which will reach a climax in a great demonstration of that power and the overthrow of Satan’s organization. These realize that they are encompassed about by enemies and would be instantly destroyed by the enemy except for the Lord’s protection. They further realize and appreciate the blessed truth that those who are of Zion have entered into the secret place of the Most High and are privileged to dwell in the shadow of the Almighty. Concerning that time it is written: “In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not; and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.”—Zephaniah 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By the Lord’s grace they claim this precious promise as to themselves, and therefore they fear not. They hear the command of the Lord saying to them of Zion, “Let not thine hands be slack.” They conceive it, therefore, to be the duty and privilege of each one to be zealous and energetic in the Lord’s service and to lovingly encourage and beseech their brethren to always be diligent in the service. (Romans 12:1) Such is the reason for the activities of the Bible Students as set forth hereinafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This report is not made because the law of any earthly organization requires it to be made. It is not made because the charter of the corporate body of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society requires it to be made. It is made to the brethren throughout the earth for the purpose of encouraging them. It is intended that each one might have some vision of how the Lord is blessing his work, and thereby may take courage and press on in doing what is found to be done and to continue to boldly make proclamation of the message which the Lord has commanded them at this time to proclaim. It is with pleasure, therefore, and with much gratitude to God and to our Lord Jesus Christ, that the following facts are submitted for the consideration of the true followers of Christ that they might take courage and continue .to rejoice.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark15"></a>HEAD OFFICE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Christians are directed by the Lord’s Word to do everything in order. It is also proper that Christians should carry on their operations in harmony with the law of the land in so far as they can consistently do so with their covenant to do God’s will. The law of the land provides that a number of persons may form themselves into an association or society under a given name and act as one person in performance of matters of business. Such an arrangement is called a corporation or an incorporated body. Any person withdrawing from the association (or society) would in no wise affect the title to property nor the operation of the association or society, where such an arrangement is made. While the Society as heretofore defined strictly consists of all the fully consecrated and anointed ones of the Lord, yet it was deemed wise and proper to have a corporate body under a given name that the work of the Society, or Christians, might be conducted in a more orderly manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Accordingly the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society was incorporated and organized under the provisions of the laws of the State of Pennsylvania. The Peoples Pulpit Association was incorporated and organized under the laws of New York. The International Bible Students Association is incorporated and organized under the laws of England. All three of these corporations are servants of the Society, that is, the anointed body of Christians on earth; and all function as one under the direction of the same official organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The head office of the Society’s organization is at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, N. Y. All departments and matters pertaining to the work in every part of the earth are directed generally from that address. Effort is made to have the most efficient organization possible. The true motive for all service to the Lord being love, the organization functions much better than any worldly or selfish organization could function. Love covers a multitude of defects. Of course the organization is not -perfect because composed of imperfect beings, but it strives to carry on in the spirit of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is to be expected that from time to time some will become weary in well-doing and drop out, while others being overreached by the enemy will become opponents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The faithful and true do not permit these things to disturb them, but go on diligently serving the Lord as he points them to the right way. The brethren, heeding the Scriptural admonition to bear one another’s burdens, by the Lord’s grace get on well with his work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The number engaged at the Brooklyn headquarters now is nearing two hundred. It became quite clear that the quarters were too small to properly care for those engaged in the work. Hence ways and means were sought to enlarge the premises. In December of 1926 the lot adjoining the property at 124 Columbia Heights was purchased; and early in January the three buildings situated on lots 122, 124 and 126 Columbia Heights were torn away and the erection of a new building begun. That building is now nearing completion. It consists of nine stories, including the sub-basement, and contains approximately 80 rooms. These are in addition to the building that is situated at the rear of these lots. On the top floor of the new building will be located the executive offices of the Society. The official address will continue to be 124 Columbia Heights. The entire premises will be occupied and exclusively used for the Society’s purposes. It is hoped that the more comfortable quarters will enable each one to render more efficient service to the glory of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The new building will provide rooms for both class and individual study, so that the evenings may be devoted to the spiritual upbuilding of the members of the household. The Bethel home is not a place for physical ease, nor is it a rest sanatorium. It is a place for strenuous service. No loafers are kept there, and none are welcome. Drones do not belong in the Lord’s service. After the usual duties of the day and the necessary class and individual study in the evening, there is no time for visiting. That is a good thing, because no opportunity is afforded for gossiping. The anointed ones are more keenly appreciating the fact that God has called them for a purpose, that there is much to be done; and they desire to get on with the work at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The organization of the Bethel home is not perfect, of course, but it is good and functions by the Lord’s grace. The president is the head of the house; and by the terms of the charter of the organization and the rules governing in it, it devolves upon him to determine who shall be members of the family. This being the headquarters of the Lord’s work on earth, every effort is made to have all members of the family efficiently perform the duties assigned to each one. There is a superintendent of the home, whose duties require him to generally look after the details of the house, the feeding and caring for the family and the comfort of the rooms. There is a housekeeper, who performs the duties usual to keeping a house of Bethel’s size. She is assisted by other sisters in looking after the rooms and'the house generally. In the kitchen is a trained and competent ehef, who together with his assistants prepares the food for the family. The dining-room is served by a number of brethren. The furnace, plumbing repairs, etc., are looked after by brethren assigned to that duty. All of these brethren are consecrated to the Lord, and take their turn in teaching Bible study classes and in proclaiming the message of the Truth in such other ways as the Lord has provided. There is no other home in America like it. Probably there is not another exactly like it on earth. There are families similarly organized in London; in Bern, Switzerland; Magdeburg, Germany ; but not an exact replica of the Bethel home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Bethel home is a happy one because it is the Lord’s house. Of course strict rules and regulations must be had and enforced. The Lord disciplines all of his children, and we should endeavor to discipline ourselves. No one is at Brooklyn headquarters because he has a full right to be there. All who are there are there by the grace of God. To be a member of the house of the Lord even on this earth is an important and serious matter. It is a wonderful privilege; and the Lord placing one there, he should remain at his place of duty until the Lord takes him away. The brethren are more fully appreciating this fact than in former days. They are realizing that it is just as important, if not the most important part of the Lord’s service on earth; and they are faithfully striving to be examples to the flock of God in performing the duties assigned to them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark17"></a>COMMISSION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">God has commissioned or authorized his people on earth to do certain specific things. Among the things that the commission of God directs his anointed ones to do are these: Tell the good tidings to the oppressed; bind up the broken-hearted; proclaim liberty to the captives; and the opening of the prison doors to them that are bound. The obligation rests upon every member of Zion to perform the duties prescribed by this divinely-given commission, in so far as possible, because each one who loves the Lord God also loves his brethren. He is anxious to aid his brethren to see their privileges </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">service and to encourage them to engage therein. Such is one of the purposes of this report.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark19"></a>THE RADIO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The oppressed people embrace the masses of humanity and are oppressed by the official part of the Devil’s organization. These must have some opportunity to learn the good news of the kingdom. God has made ample provisions for them to learn thereof and be relieved of their burdens. The broken-hearted include many who have suffered either directly.or indirectly from war, fraud or injustice. God has provided the balm to heal their hearts. The captives are those who have fallen into the trap or snare of the evil one, which trap is set and baited by the ecclesiastics, who are servants of the evil one. These captives must have an opportunity to find the way to freedom. The prisoners are those who are held in the denominational religious systems, and who by reason of fear resulting from threats or coercion know not how to escape. The prison doors must be opened, because God has commanded such. The members of Zion cannot well enter these prisons; but they can proclaim the good news from afar and encourage and strengthen the prisoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Long centuries ago God foresaw the conditions now being experienced. He provided the radio, whereby the members of Zion can speak at long distances to those who are kept in the prison house of the ecclesiastical systems. In due time he brought the radio into operation to meet the present conditions and to be used to serve upon the peoples of earth notice of his intention to set up his kingdom. Of course Satan the enemy is expected to do all within his power to prevent the broadcasting of the truth, which would be a comfort and aid to the prisoners. The Lord’s anointed have had to encounter this opposition in their daily efforts to make known the good tidings of the kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark21"></a>STATIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Radio Station WBBR is owned by the Society. Fot some time it operated upon the favorable wave length of 416.4 meters, and was sending out the good tidings with great force and through the prison walls. It was reaching many at a long distance. Its wave length was suddenly reduced to the less favorable one of 256 meters. Acting upon its legal privilege WBBR filed an application for a hearing before the Federal Radio Commission, asking to be placed upon a more favorable wave length. At the conclusion of that hearing the decision of the Radio Commission was against WBBR. The hearing, however, was not without good results. It seems quite certain that the Lord lets the adversary go so far and no farther in operation against him and his anointed; and that in his own good time and way he makes the wrath of the enemy to result to God’s praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord used the conditions arising at Washington, D. C., in the hearing of the above case to provide for the greatest broadcasting arrangement ever -on earth up to that time. The lecture “Freedom for the Peoples” was delivered by the president of the Society at Toronto, Canada, to a visible audience approximating fifteen thousand people. Fifty-three radio stations were tied together by wire connections; and the lecture transmitted from the auditorium at Toronto to the central station in New York known as WEAK, and from there sent to all parts of the United States, and was heard clearly from Maine to California and from Canada to Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Within the area served by these stations are more than six million receiving sets. In numerous places large companies were assembled in halls, while other companies were in private homes; and it has been recently estimated that the audience ranged from fifty to seventy-five million persons. Of course, no one can tell the exact number. Great numbers of letters were received from every part of the United.States and Canada, requesting copies of the lecture. A full report was printed in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font3"> and in response to these requests more than twenty-nine thousand copies were sent out. This publication was followed by the issuing of a booklet, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom for the Peoples,</span><span class="font3"> which contains the lecture and the resolution passed at Toronto, and which has already been printed and shipped out to the classes for distribution to the number of 1,898,796.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The far-reaching effect of the aforementioned radio hook-up cannot now be well estimated. Reports from every part of the country are to the effect that it broke down a tremendous amount of prejudice, and opened the eyes of great numbers who are now willing to listen to the message concerning the kingdom of God. Heretofore the clergy have misrepresented the message of the Lord’s kingdom and grossly misrepresented and slandered the servants of the Lord, and have thereby prejudiced the minds of the people against the Bible Students and against the Lord’s message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The lecture “Freedom for the Peoples” broadcast over fifty-three stations, and heard by so many, exposed the duplicity of the clergy and enabled the people to begin to see them in the true light. The people are now beginning to learn that organized Christianity, called Christendom, is a fraud and a snare and an instrument of the Devil to work against the interests of mankind. The people have been bearing up this organized system for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">long while; and now seeing that the ecclesiastics are in an unholy alliance with the profiteers and professional politicians, it is to be expected that the common people will withdraw their support, and it is quite manifest that such is progressing just now. This is gratifying, because it seems to be clearly in fulfilment of the prophetic utterances found in the Scriptures. This tends to strengthen the faith of the Lord’s servants in every part of the earth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark23"></a>OTHER RADIO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The Society owns and operates a five-kilowatt radio station with studio at Chicago, Illinois, which is devoted to the broadcasting of the kingdom message. This station has served people with the glad tidings of the kingdom as far north as the extreme part of Alaska, and south to the northern part of South America, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast, and has been heard in Australia and Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By contract and arrangement the Society also does the exclusive broadcasting of all Biblical matters over WHK in Cleveland and KFWM at Oakland, California. These stations serve a wide area, and the letters coming from the people indicate that great numbers are benefited and comforted by what they hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to the above, the Society owns and operates four radio stations in Canada; and these stations well cover all the provinces from the Maritime Provinces to the Pacific Ocean. These stations are served regularly by consecrated children of the Lord. The sacred songs and other sacred music broadcast are greatly commented upon and enjoyed by the common people. The music of all the Society’s stations has come in for much ridicule at the hands of opponents, the claim being made that it is amateur and not up to the standard. Attention is here called to the fact that it was the common people who heard the Lord gladly; and the same class of people now hear the message of the kingdom gladly. This is evidently the class that the Lord wishes to be reached. As a general rule this class of people are not so highly educated in music as that term is generally understood. The music that appeals to them is that which stirs their hearts and minds to an adoration and ■worship of Jehovah. The songs of praise to the great Creator of heaven and earth, the soul-inspiring music of the old masters, who were moved by the spirit of the Lord to write them, are the ones which the common people love to hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This is the very kind of music that is seldom if ever heard over some of the so-called most popular stations in America. It can therefore be confidently said that the stations that are operated by the Society furnish the very kind of programs that are beneficial and helpful to the people, and that they provide the very things that the people need for their aid and comfort. This is another evidence that the Society is doing the Lord’s work by means of the radio just as he intended it to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The anointed therefore with confidence can go on, knowing that the Lord will not permit the enemy to stop the broadcasting of the message of his kingdom, unless it is his good will that such shall be done. If that time should come, then the Lord’s people would know that it is proper, that Jehovah had served all the notice upon the people that he desired to serve at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to the above radio stations, owners of many other stations have been approached by the consecrated in various ecclesias, and arrangements have been made to regularly broadcast the message of God’s kingdom. At the end of this fiscal year the total number of stations in the United States and Canada broadcasting the message of the Truth, including those owned and operated by the Society and those from which time is bought by the various ecclesias in different parts of the country, aggregate the total of, to wit, ninety-five. Many will say that this is miraculous, and indeed it is. It is the Lord’s doing, and marvelous in out eyes. The radio belongs to the Lord, and he will have it used to just such extent as he desires it to be used. The brethren therefore in every part of the earth should be encouraged to use every available means at hand to make arrangements to use the radio for telling the prisoners of the glad tidings. Those who are restrained by their prison-keepers, the clergy, from attending public meetings can sit in their homes and turn the dial and listen to the message coming through the walls, telling them that Jehovah is God, that Christ is King, and that the day of deliverance is near at hand!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to broadcasting the kingdom message in America and Canada, our brethren in Hawaii have for some time been regularly broadcasting. Also our brethren in Australia have sent forth the message of the kingdom over the ether and are continuing so to do. The same glad tidings have been broadcast in Spain, in Holland and in Denmark, which latter stations with powerful equipment have sent the message throughout Britain and Ireland and many of the European countries. The brethren in other parts of the earth are taking advantage of every opportunity possible to make arrangements for the broadcasting of the Truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It will be observed in considering the report that the public meetings addressed by speakers in public halls have not been so well attended during the past year; but this is fully explained when we take into consideration the fact that great multitudes, far beyond any that have ever heard in public halls, have been getting the message by radio in their homes. Ample proof of this is furnished by the number of letters that are received, showing the great numbers that are gladly receiving the message of Truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It will be further observed from the report that the circulation of books and booklets throughout the earth is greatly in excess of that in any former year. This can be largely accounted for by reason of the use of the radio. Those who go about from door to door with the books frequently report that when a house is approached having a radio set, it is only necessary to mention that these books contain the message broadcast by the Bible Students, or something to that effect. Those who have heard by radio invariably desire to have the lectures in printed form. These appear regularly in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> and now in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower.</span><span class="font3"> This opens the way for the sale of the books and booklets; and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">witness that God intends should be given goes grandly on, to his glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The radio has also furnished a wider field for service by the brethren of the various ecclesias. To put a program on requires a speaker or one who is a good reader. Almost every class throughout the land finds amongst its numbers one or more brethren who are competent to proclaim the message of the kingdom by radio. It can therefore truly be said that the message during the past year has been preached to more people than at any other time during the Christian era. This ought to be exceedingly gratifying and encouraging to everyone who loves the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Truth is also broadcast from the Society’s stations and other stations in German, French, Polish, Italian, Swedish, Norwegian and other foreign tongues. This enables those in the United States who have come from a foreign country to hear the message of Truth in their native tongue. There are competent brethren in the Truth who speak these languages who regularly serve at the radio stations.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark25"></a>BOOK MANUFACTURE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The wide advertising of the King and the kingdom by radio has greatly increased the demand for books, booklets and other literature. This necessitates the manufacture of more books and literature. No one but the Lord, knowing the end from the beginning, could have timed everything so exactly and arranged it so perfectly. Ten years ago the Society was printing and manufacturing no books whatsoever. Now it prints and manufactures all the books, booklets, magazines and other publications that it sends out. The work is all done by consecrated hands, and the Lord continues to add his blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the annual report of 1926 reference was made to the fact that the Society had purchased a lot and had begun the erection of a new factory building. This building was completed and ready for occupancy February last. The printing and book-binding machinery was moved into it, and work begun. The building covers a lot of ground practically one hundred feet square and is eight stories high, with a freight elevator and a passenger elevator, light and well ventilated, and furnishes a splendid home for the manufacture and shipping of the books and booklets and generally for the work that is carried on in the office in connection therewith. This building and the equipment are a real joy to those who have had a part in the work at headquarters during the past six years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The progress of the printing and manufacturing of books by the brethren during the past few years is marvelous. When it began, our brethren knew nothing about the use of the machines. They had to learn. As a comparison with what they can now do and what they were able to do at the beginning, the following is an instance: A large press was manufactured in Germany for the Society and shipped to Brooklyn. It was necessary to bring an expert mechanic from Germany to install the press. This expert together with several helpers took two months in which to put it up and get the machine in operation. Within two years thereafter another press of the same size and make was bought in Germany and stripped to America. It was erected by one brother in the factory, together with others who assisted him; and this was done in three weeks. Many marvel at what the brethren are able to do. Men of the world cannot understand it. It is plain, however, to those who are devoted to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When the time came for the erection of the tabernacle in the wilderness, God directed Moses to speak unto the children of Israel and say to them that they should bring an ottering “every man that giveth it willingly with his heart”. (Exodus 25: 2) In the construction of the tabernacle work was to be done in stone, wood-carving, gold and silver, which required skilful workmanship. God called certain men to do this work and it is recorded concerning them, “And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship; and to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in the cutting of stones to set them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.” (Exodus 35:31-33) By this we understand that the Lord specially qualified men to perform this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It must be conceded that the preparation of the Lord’s message to be sent to and enlighten the people is of like great importance, and the Lord God could just as easily qualify men in the use of machinery to manufacture books as he could qualify them to do skilled labor in connection with the tabernacle. The brethren who served for the tabernacle construction did so willingly with a pure heart. The brethren who have served in the erection and operation of the machinery to manufacture books and booklets, have done so willingly with pure hearts devoted to the Lord. The results have been beyond the understanding of worldly men. The results should be and are encouraging to all who are in the Lord’s service. Ordinarily men who operate such machines must serve an apprenticeship under one who knows and learn gradually, but even then they are not prompted by the right spirit to do the best work When one is thoroughly devoted to the Lord and anxious to learn and trusts in the Lord and then puts forth his best efforts, he may depend upon it that the Lord will help him. The proof of this is shown in the progress of the Society’s plant for the, publication of its books and literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brother Martin is the manager of the factory and office at 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn, N. Y. He has been keenly interested in and participated in the progress of the printing works from its inception. In his report to the president of the Society made at the end of the fiscal year he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It was a great day when the Lord put it into your heart to let us get out the big edition of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> No. 27 in the Lord’s own factory and with the Lord’s own help. That seems like a long time ago now. Things move so rapidly. And yet it is only seven years. And in those seven years what wonders have been wrought as regards the Lord’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I have forgotten now how many carloads that special edition of four million copies made, but it would have made a fair sized train, and it was all run olf on one big rotary press, the one that we still fondly call by the name “the old battleship”. That old battleship has been a good friend to us all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">You will remember that when you first tried to buy a large rotary press, right after the war, the first answer was that there were only a few of them in the country, and that they were all busy, and there was no chance whatever of getting one for many months, longer, indeed, than it seemed right to wait.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But at the right time the Lord opened the door; and the big rotary came into our hands, came into the hands that knew nothing about its construction and operation. But the Lord knows how to quicken the minds of those who have committed their all to him. And in a few days, one might almost say, but surely in a very few weeks, we were able to make that press hum; and it is still humming, doing work that even its makers never knew it could do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That was a very, very little print shop in which we first put the battleship to work; that is to say, little as compared with our present ideas and present surroundings. The whole floor space available for factory operations was only 3000 square feet, distributed over three floors; and the whole force working on production of printed matter was only twenty brethren. Only the Lord’s help made it possible to do what was done. Previous to that issue every bit of our printing had been done by outside concerns, and we were always dependent on them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark27"></a>THE DAY OF THE BOOKLETS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">It was another great day for the Lord’s work when you wanted to know if it would not be possible to get out our own booklets on the battleship. It did not look at all feasible at the start. For one thing, the makers themselves said it could not be done. It never had been done, and therefore it was useless to try. But we tried, and you know the result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Back there in 1920, when the boys first started to make booklets on the battleship, the total number of booklets made per day averaged only a thousand, but by the next year it was 3,000 per day, by 1923 it was 6,000 per day, by 1926 it was over 10,000 per day, now it averages 15,000 for every day; and these booklets are all made on the same press. Experience and the Lord’s blessing have accomplished these results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As you know, all our booklets are wire-stitched. On our first stitcher two workers could stitch 2,000 booklets in a day, or at that rate, when they had them to stitch. Now, with an improved stitcher, which makes two stitches at once instead of separate stitching for each wire; two expert operators will each stitch 25,000 of the booklets in one day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Similar progress is to be noted on the folding of the booklets. The folder, you know, is our own invention, and very efficient. Two brethren on this folder displaced twelve when we folded them by hand. At the outset a capable brother could fold 10,000 booklets a day on the folder; today a brother, disciplined in the use of hands and eyes and muscles, folds 30,000 on the same machine, a remarkable achievement.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark29"></a>THE DAY OF THE BOOKS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Greatest day of all was the day when you wanted to know if there was any good reason why we should not print and bind all our own books. It was a breath-taking idea, because it meant the opening of a complete typesetting, electroplating, printing and binding plant, with the operation of more than a score of unfamiliar machines, mostly machines we never knew were made, and the necessity of learning more than a dozen trades. But it seemed the best way to meet the war prices charged for books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">You leased the six-story building at IS Concord Street (with tenants on two floors) ; and on March 1, 1922, we moved in. You bought for us a complete outfit of typesetting, electroplating, printing and binding machinery, most of it new, some of it second-hand; and we started work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One of the great printing establishments which had been doing much of our work heard of what we were doing and came, in the person of the president, to visit us. He saw the new equipment and sagely remarked, “Here you are with a first-class printing establishment on your hands, and nobody around the place that knows a thing about what to do with it. In six months the whole thing will be a lot of junk; and you will find out that the people to do your printing are those that have always done it, and make it their business.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That sounded logical enough, but it left out the Lord; and he has always been with us. When the bindery was started he sent along a brother who has spent his whole life in the binding business. He was of great use at the time he was most needed. With his assistance, and with the Lord’s spirit working through the brethren who were trying to learn, it was not long before we were making books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At first the book production did not go so fast. Books cannot be rushed, anyway. But during the first year that we did our own binding we managed to bind 2,000 per day, and that seemed like a good many at the time. The next year, we bound 3,000 per day; and in 1924 we jumped to 5,500 per day. In 1926 we were binding 8,000 per day; and now, with our new machinery, we are producing 10,000 to 12,000 books per day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With our new rotary press, just brought in from Germany, we shall be able to produce 18,000 to 20,000 bound volumes per day, with no very great increase in number of workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When our brethren first started to sew books they could sew 500 books a day; now they have become so expert that one of them turns out 3,000 per day. This involves very close coordination of hand and eye, and ceaseless industry from morning until night. This kind of help cannot be obtained outside, at any price. We often have people go through our plant who marvel at the speed with which our brethren work; and, in the case of worldlings, they wonder what must be the fabulous wages which we pay them to get such work done.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark31"></a>THE DAY OF THE FACTORY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The greatest day of ail was the day when you bought this property and began to plan the erection of what is now admitted even by its critics, to be one of the finest printshops in the center of the world’s printing business, namely, New York City. We cannot say less for our new factory. It is everything that a print-shop should be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The general plan of the building is perfect for our work. The work all moves downward from floor to floor by gravity, and in the natural order: Offices on the top floor, where they belong; typesetting on the next floor, where it logically follows; the plates go down to the next floor, the sixth, where the printing is done; mailing and booklets take up the fifth; binding comes on the fourth; storage, on the third; shipping, on the second; paper stock, garage and power-plant, on the first. Nothing could improve on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Despite the tremendous increase in production of books and booklets, our factory force, 1. e., the actual book-making force, has increased only from twenty to ninety-five. Improved machinery, greater experience, better factory facilities, have wrought the changes; and over all has been the Lord’s blessing, without which our efforts would have been of little avail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A feature of our new building which has excited general admiration of printers and others is that, when the building was made, all the electric light and power conduits were laid in the floor, completely out of sight. As additions are made to the machinery from time to time no fresh wiring is necessary. The places where the new machines are to stand were plotted while the building was in process of construction, and all provision made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The only work the three-ton freight elevator has to perform is to carry the paper stock from the first floor to the pressroom, which is on the sixth floor. From there the paper, in the form of books and booklets, finds its way by gravity from one operation to another until it finally lands on the shipping floor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The front hallway, on the first floor, and the entire top floor, are most attractively finished, all lending an air of cheeriness to workers and visitors. The fourteen-passenger elevator is ample for all our needs and will empty the building in a few minutes. There is not a better heated, lighted or ventilated building in New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The power-plant of 340 horse-power furnishes all the light and power used in the building and allows a generous margin for growth. The building is strictly fire-proof. The drinking water is continually flowing to all floors, the surplus running into the roof tank. Toilet accommodations are adequate and sanitary. All this keeps the workers in good physical and mental condition, able to do their best work.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark33"></a>OTHER FACTORIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">What is here said about the Brooklyn factory may also be said about the Society’s manufacturing equipment at Magdeburg, Germany, and Berne, Switzerland. Magdeburg is not quite so extensive as Brooklyn, and Switzerland is less, but each one has done splendid work and in proportion to the number employed and the equipment used. The Lord has put his spirit upon the brethren there and blessed their efforts, as will be seen by the reports from these respective countries.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark35"></a>PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The production of books and other publications at the headquarters in the United 'States during the year 1927 is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Bound books &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2,205,548</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Booklets &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,293,905</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Total books and booklets &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6,499,453</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This is a total increase of production of books and booklets for 1927 over 1926 of 3,555,892 volumes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year this factory has produced and sent out </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3"> to the number of 1,576,300 and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> to the number of 1,864,900. Free tracts, including the volunteer distribution of the early part of the fiscal year, 1,171,400; handbills, 5,566,650.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It must be kept in mind that the production of the factory was interrupted for some time while the presses and other machinery were being torn down and removed from 18 Concord Street and erected at 117 Adams Street. There was a decided inefficiency of operation throughout the entire plant for this reason. But notwithstanding this inefficiency the increased equipment and facilities, and the better equipment of the brethren who do the work, resulted in an increased production for 1927 over that of 1926 as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Bound books Booklets</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2">1,066,471</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">2,489,421</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">This showing is gratifying when we take into consideration the many handicaps that were encountered during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the fiscal year the following shipment of books and booklets was made to classes, colporteurs and branches, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Booklets (English) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2,551,963</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Bound books (English) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,610,084</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">making a total increase of 828,423 over that of 1926.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Bound books (foreign) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57,367</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Booklets (foreign) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;327,036</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The total shipment of books and booklets from Brooklyn headquarters during the fiscal year of 1927 aggregates 6,445,246 copies.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark37"></a>FIELD ACTIVITIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The week of August 28 to September 5 inclusive was set aside as general service week. reports from all parts of the field, America, Europe, Asia and Africa, show a decided increase over that of 1926. The actual numbers of the workers in the field have been slightly less than in 1926; but the zeal and earnestness manifested have been greater and the blessings, of the Lord greater and the results greater. In the United States reports from 657 classes out of 866 classes organized for the work, show that 9,398 workers were in the field during I. B. S. A. week. These workers disposed of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">1,040 sets of 7 volumes 1,351 sets of 8 volumes 18,254 copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God,  </span><span class="font2">31,499 copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">making a total of 67,981 bound volumes. In addition to that, these workers sold that week 189,456 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The importance of the kingdom work would warrant more than one service week during the year; and if it seems possible for the brethren to engage in it for more than one week during 1928, the arrangement will be made. We invite suggestions from all parts of the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the United States there are 866 classes organized for service work. There should be more. There are 509 sharpshooters in the field. In 1926 there were 1,540 workers in the field each week, whereas in 1927 there were 2,406. In 1927 these workers disposed of a total number of 352,959 volumes. The class workers during the same period sold 1,098,001 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some of the brethren have not appreciated the difference between the work of the church as foreshadowed by Elijah and Elisha. The above is a fair illustration. Prior to 1918 the work amongst the classes generally was to arrange for a pilgrim visit and listen to discourses, and to arrange for public meetings and call on those who left their names at the public meetings. In other words, most of the preaching was done by the pilgrims and other speakers. Particularly in the last few years, since the organization of the class service work, an opportunity is afforded for every member of the classes to do some preaching. By preaching is not meant merely talking with one’s mouth, but it means a proclamation of the Truth. Preaching the Gospel to the people, means bringing the people in contact with the good news of the kingdom. Even the small sixty-four-page booklet contains that which is equivalent to at least four sermons, and a four-hundred-page book is equivalent to thirty-five or forty sermons, at a low estimate. Besides, when one reads he usually gets more benefit than from listening to another talk. The class service work has afforded an opportunity for all who engage in it to carry the message to the people in a more effective manner than has ever been done before. It is gratifying to see how the Lord has blessed it during the fiscal year just closed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark39"></a>COLPORTEURS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">In times past colporteurs have done the larger portion of the work in the field. They continue to do their portion of it. Their forces are greatly augmented by the class service workers, however. During the fiscal year of 1927, 398 colporteurs have devoted their entire time to the service, and an average of 397 auxiliary colporteurs have devoted a good portion of their time to the field service, making a total of 795 engaged in the active field service as compared with 721 for 1926. The reported sales of these faithful workers in the field during the year are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sets of 8 volumes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11,839</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sets of 7 volumes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,866</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;135,137</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">or a total of 151,842 sales, and a total of volumes of books sold 263,911.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The total sales of bound volumes of books by class workers and colporteurs during the fiscal year is 616,870. This is a less number of sales of bound volumes than in 1926. The sale of booklets by classes and colporteurs during the fiscal year was, to wit, 1,568,982, which is a large increase over that of 1926. An examination of this shows that there have been less volumes of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures</span><span class="font3"> placed in 1927 than in 1926, but the sales of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Harp</span><span class="font3"> and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font3"> have shown a decided increase in the sale of bound volumes, and there was a still greater increase of the sale of booklets.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark41"></a>THE FAMILY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">During the fiscal year the members of the Bethel family have devoted a part of Saturday and a part of Sunday to field service work. The results have been unusually good. Being in the vicinity of Radio Station WBBR, there has been a decided increase of sales, and a great number of people have been witnessed to by the family. This is a little diversion from their routine work in office and factory, and all who have engaged in it have received a great blessing therefrom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark43"></a>PILGRIM SERVICE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The term pilgrim hardly conveys the proper thought with reference to the brethren who are engaged in this kind of work. A pilgrim is a wayfarer or traveler; and while some of the brethren travel a long distance and can properly be called pilgrims for that reason, some of them travel less. During the fiscal year 1927, those who are in the field all the time have been assigned two days at a place; and at least a portion of that time has been occupied in canvassing for the books and encouraging the classes to likewise engage in this work. This has been very much blessed by the Lord, and shows a decided healthy growth of the brethren in spiritual matters and in zeal for the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A large number of the brethren who have done public speaking are those from the Bethel home who serve classes on Saturday evenings and Sundays, aside from the use of the radio. These have also spent some time in the respective classes, encouraging them in the canvassing work on Saturday afternoons and Sunday mornings. These traveling brethren or pilgrims not only serve the classes and the public, but they serve at funerals When requested so to do. Funeral services of course are always free. This particular branch of the work in the United States is directed from the Pilgrim Department, and includes not only the English-speaking brethren but brethren who speak other languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The following is a brief report of the number of brethren engaged in this part of the service during the year in the United States, showing the nationality, the number of each, public meetings held, attendance, class meetings and attendance, and miles traveled, to wit:</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark45"></a>FREE LITERATURE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">At our annual convention during the past few years it has been customary to pass a resolution and have it to form a part of the literature for free distribution. A large number of these tracts have been printed and put out amongst the people; but results obtained hardly seem adequate for the effort put forth, because much of the literature was wasted. This and other things bearing on the matter seemed to indicate that it would be the Lord’s will that the resolution passed by the general convention at Toronto, and the attending lecture in support thereof, should not be distributed free but should be put in booklet form and sold to the people at the nominal price of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">5$.</span><span class="font3"> It is believed that where people pay something for a book or booklet they are more likely to read it than if it is given to them. The chief purpose of putting out literature is to aid people to understand concerning Jehovah and his great plan. Taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances, the Society concluded to print the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom for the Peoples</span><span class="font3"> and send it out to the classes and have them sell it. As above stated, 1,898,796 have thus far been shipped out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is hoped that the brethren will be able to canvass every house in the land, and place as many copies as possible. Already the results are gratifying. This booklet during 1927 will take the place of free literature heretofore distributed. It is being translated into the foreign languages and will likewise be circulated amongst the peoples of other countries.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark47"></a>CORRESPONDENCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">A very large correspondence is carried on at the Brooklyn headquarters. The purpose is to aid the brethren throughout the land to answer perplexing questions that may arise. There is also a large amount of correspondence in connection with the routine work. A great many of the letters are addressed to the president of the Society personally. An attempt is made to answer all of these; but sometimes it is found that the press of other and more important matters makes it necessary to delegate this to some other part of the organization. The Society maintains a regular correspondence department that deals with the general affairs of the Society. During the fiscal year of 1926 this correspondence has been large. The number of letters and cards received was 218,820; the number dispatched, 212,424.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THE WATCH TOWER</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3"> may be properly designated the official journal of the Society. It is published by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. It carries a list of the speakers that are sent about to the various classes of International Bible Students. It also publishes a list of the radio stations that are broadcasting the kingdom message. It carries brief notices of such other matters as are of special importance to its readers. The chief object of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3"> is to call the attention of the consecrated to the great truths of the divine plan as the Lord seems pleased to reveal them to his people. Effort is made to have one leading article in each issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3"> discussing some important truth. There is no claim, of course, that these are infallible. The Lord has promised that the light shall increase upon his Word as we come nearer the perfect day. We should therefore, in harmony with this promise, expect increased light upon the Scriptures. This does not mean new light, but it does mean a better understanding of what the Lord has given to his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The classes of Bible Students generally have adopted a regular </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font3"> study, which is held once a week, and in many cases two or three times per week. The study is on the first or leading article of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower.</span><span class="font3"> This study is led by some competent brother. Questions following the article are published; and these questions are propounded by the leader and discussed by the class and the text of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3"> itself bearing upon the question is read. Another method often adopted is to first read the paragraph, and then have questions propounded upon that paragraph and carefully considered by all present. Where the spirit of the Lord prevails and there is an earnest desire to get at the meaning of the matter, the classes are generally blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of course, there are those who from time to time say unkind and scurrilous things concerning some who are engaged in the Lord’s service, and others write asking that replies be made through </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower.</span><span class="font3"> This will not be done, however. The purpose and intention of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3"> is to aid the brethren, and not to be drawn into controversies. The Devil would be pleased to have its columns used for controversies and thus crowd out the truths that the Lord’s people need. Those who are really devoted to the Lord have confidence that he is managing his work; and they trust him to take care of any one that may be derelict in the performance of duty. They therefore give no heed to those who make an effort to destroy and not to build up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The reports from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font3"> readers show that during the year they have been greatly blessed. This is gratifying to those who have to do with its publication, as well as to those who read it. During the fiscal year, in addition to the renewals of subscriptions there have been 12,480 new subscriptions added to the list. The total number of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3"> published during the year is 1,583,500.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark50"></a>THE GOLDEN AGE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord’s blessing continues with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font3">magazine. Each issue carries one or more radio lectures. Besides the one reading and using the radio talk first, others in different parts of the country and in different stations are privileged to use these lectures and read them over the radio. Its columns also carry other matters of interest, and it has been a source of help to a great many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to the renewal of subscriptions during the year, there have been added 12,025 new subscriptions. Many of these have been from those who have heard the message of Truth broadcast from some radio station. Announcers at the radio stations frequently call attention to the fact that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> carries these lectures and thereby advise the hearers where they may get the lecture in print.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark52"></a>CONVENTIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">During the fiscal year the International Convention of the Society was held at Toronto. That convention was evidently arranged by the Lord, and it had the blessing of the Lord beyond doubt. It greatly stimulated the brethren who attended, and doubtless increased their zeal; and the result is shown from the service week that followed. The radiocasting of a good portion of the program, and particularly that of the resolution and public lecture, encouraged the brethren in other parts of the country to make effort to broadcast the Truth; and doubtless the convention indirectly affected the increase of broadcasting that is now being carried on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many other conventions have been held throughout the United States and Canada during the year. One particular feature about these conventions has been that a portion of the time, as least a half day, at each convention has been set aside for field service. A number of the conventions have devoted a whole day to field service. This has encouraged many who have never heretofore participated in the field service, to engage in it; and the Lord has added his blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Members of the Society who speak other languages than English have held conventions throughout the United States during the fiscal year. The principal one of these was held at Detroit in July. Reports from that convention show a decided impetus to the work; and that those attending received many blessings, and these blessings overflowed to the benefit and encouragement of the brethren at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Conventions held in Switzerland, Germany, Denmark and Scotland during the year, reports of which have appeared in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font3"> have been a decided encouragement and a great blessing to the brethren of these countries.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Because there are more Spanish people in Southern California it has been thought wise to conduct the Spanish work from there. Brother Montero has been looking after this work for some time. There are some Spanish classes in the United States, and some in Mexico, that receive attention from the Society through its representative. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3"> is published every other month. In addition to this, another edition of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3"> is published in Madrid, Spain, and the subscribers in America receive copies of each. During the year books were sold to the number of 1,037, and booklets 5,000. Free tracts containing the London Resolution were distributed to the amount of 20,000, and other free tracts 10,000. Letters received 931; dispatched 955; packages sent out 440.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is no one giving full time to the colporteur work, but the class workers are organized and carry on the work. Service Week was specially blessed by the Lord. During that week 896 books were sold. Now the Spanish brethren are devoting Saturday afternoons and Sunday mornings to the service, with good results. Two Spanish brethren in Texas visit the classes and serve them. The Lord adds his blessing to their efforts. It is said of them that they are not particularly learned; but they have the spirit of the Lord, and that is the class that the Lord is blessing and reaching at this time.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark156"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark157"></a>FINANCIAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">It is remarkable the amount of work that is carried on by the Lord’s people with a small amount of money involved. The Good Hopes or Tract Fund during the fiscal year has not been so great, as will be seen. During the fiscal year the Good Hopes Tract Fund totaled $170,685.89. Balance from 1926 $608.82, or a total of $171,294.71. Disbursements out of that were made as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By pilgrim expense &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$29,864.00</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark158"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark159"></a>LOCAL DEPOTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to the printing plant maintained by the Society at Brooklyn, it maintains three local depots in the United States, to wit: Chicago, St. Louis, and Oakland, Calif. At each of these depots there are job-printing presses, which presses do the printing of the handbills and small advertising matter for the classes within certain zones. At each of these depots a stock of books is kept for quick shipment. Books are shipped to the depots in car-load lots, thus reducing the cost of transportation. They are reshipped from these depots to the classes within the respective zones. By a uniform system of transportation charges, the Society is enabled to make the price of the books the same in every part of the United States. In addition, these depots furnish a place where the colporteurs and class workers can get their supplies quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The brethren in charge of the depots respectively, have their opportunities of service as elders of the local class or over the radio. Orders for books sent to the headquarters at Brooklyn are filled by the head office from these local depots. The cost of maintaining the depots is easily covered and more by the reduced cost of transportation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Viewing that part of the field as a whole throughout the United States, the results for the year 1937 are very gratifying. We give thanks to the Lord and take courage and press on, knowing that the kingdom is at hand.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark160"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark161"></a>FOREIGN COUNTRIES</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">The operations of the Society in the various countries of earth are directed from the head office at Brooklyn. Each branch has a local manager. A uniform system of operation has been adopted in each of the foreign offices, and the effort is to all work exactly on the same line, in so far as that is possible. Below is given a brief account of the work in each of the countries mentioned.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark162"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark163"></a>BRITAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">It is a very notable fact in Britain and Ireland that the clergymen are now openly repudiating the Bible. It is heart-cheering at the same time to see the Lord using his anointed ones in these countries to make a wider and more effective witness to Jehovah and his kingdom, than ever before. The convention in London last year provoked the clergy; and the line between them as &quot;Satan's representatives and the Lord’s servants has been drawn in a more marked degree. This is desirable to many good people. The result is that more people are ready to listen to the Truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The local manager, Brother Hemery, gives a succinct summary of the work in that land. The following is a quotation from his report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At once I can say that the work year just closed has been the best we have known in Britain and Ireland; for, as the details which follow show, there has been very considerable increase in all branches of service and activity. Increase must to some extent be measured by output of books, even though that may not be considered the greatest thing. Under the present circumstances, however, increase in output is a necessary part of faithful service to Jehovah; it certainly tells whether or not a full measure of service is being rendered. When we can report, as we do, that three-fourths of a million books and booklets have been sent out of the London office during the past year (the actual number is 752,071), we have great cause for rejoicing; for the figure is a very large one. It means that the friends have been very active in the Lord’s service; and also, as all experience shows, that a great many faithful servants of the Lord have enjoyed his blessings through realizing their privileges of service. The figure, when taken in comparison with previous years, speaks of a healthy work, of desire to serve the cause of Jehovah, and to work under his guidance through the arrangement he has made for his people’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The SERVICE work has resulted in the sale of 444,414 books out of the three-quarters of a million sent out from the office. This is a very considerable increase on last year, and is encouraging in view of the fact that on the special occasion of the London convention of last year 120,000 booklets were sold in one day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The COLPORTEUR work -shows no increase in the number of workers, but the total output of 257,425 books is an increase of 56,000 volumes on last year’s figures. This means that more time has been spent, and a greater ability in gaining sales. A less number of sets of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Studies</span><span class="font2"> has been sold during the past year, but we confidently expect that the cheaper rate at which the books are now being sold will result in a great increase. A very considerable colporteur work has been done in Ireland, but there are only a few apparent results of the labors. It is impossible to establish classes in the country districts in Ireland. The colporteur service is very highly appreciated; and we constantly pray for these servants of the Lord who from day to day, often under difficult circumstances, seek to spend their time in the service of Jehovah, carrying the message of truth from door to door. The Lord blesses these faithful ones in their experiences, making them ready channels of blessing for himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The COUNTRY WITNESS work has been active during the year. The brethren engaged have speeded up. The various parties have held 1981 meetings, with public attendance of 26,013 persons. Besides the lectures these brethren have distributed 750,000 advertisements, each with some word about the kingdom, and have sold 19,538 volumes. Besides places previously visited 363 places have been visited, most of which have had no witness for several years. Chiefly through this service, this England of many villages and small towns away from the rush of commercial life, and many parts of Scotland and Ireland, have been given an opportunity of hearing of the establishment of God’s kingdom of righteousness. Of late years we have made more definite endeavor to leave after each witness a little company of interested friends who would carry on the work. This endeavor has been productive; for as a result forty-five new classes have been definitely formed during the year. Some of these are already sending in their weekly service reports, and making public witness efforts; and besides these there are other little companies being eared for by classes in the neighborhood, and these promise well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The PILGRIM service is now comparatively small, and the preaching curtailed. The brethren spend a considerable portion of their time leading the classes out into the service work, and in endeavoring to encourage them in that work of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Forty-eight new classes have been formed during the year. The letters dispatched number 53,596; and those received, 36,652.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In connection with the Service work it seems appropriate to mention the work done by the London Bethel service party. By the arrangement which you made the brethren in the Bethel here are freed for Saturday service; and each week, unless circumstances prevent, the party goes out on service. Besides that, Sunday morning opportunities are used; and week-night hours are often seized that the work may be as productive as possible. During the year 17,035 calls have been made, resulting in the sale of 6349 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While it is a pleasure to report an increase on last year's figures, and to show a total of sales of over 750,000 books, yet on analysis and reviewing the situation it is quite apparent that much more can be done. If we say that there are nearly 6,000 workers who have put out this, it means that per week they have sold only at the rate of one and a half books on each occasion of canvass; and it further means that there are very many of the Lord’s people who are not using their privileges of service, nor realizing the responsibility which lies upon them as servants of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is a pleasure to report that the brethren who have the work at heart are one in spirit, and that those who no longer walk with us do not leave gaps in the ranks of the workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The ordinary outlook for the sale of books seems as good as ever; but in view of the great reduction in the price of books which you arranged when you were here, and which commences with our new year, the situation may be considered as much more favorable to the Lord’s work; and we confidently expect that the sales during the coming year, apart from the new booklet, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom for the Peoples,</span><span class="font2"> will approximate the total of one million copies. Besides, the fact that the books already published are now to be sold at a rate which precludes any possible demur because of cost, the fact that a new book is promised, and that so many places still remain to be worked with the books we already have, it may be considered that all our territory is renewed to us. In view of this, great is the opportunity for all who are able so to do, to arrange their life so as to give their time to the Lord in the colporteur service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The recent Glasgow convention when you were with us was the means of a great stimulus to the brethren. We have had no time just like it for that, not even excepting the London convention of last year. That did its own work; but in Glasgow there was a realization of a shortness of the time, the urgency of the work, and the privilege of service. Nearly all the brethren assembled there went out to work on the service day of the convention, and their labors were unusually profitable in sales.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The outlook for the work is favorable; for though the trade conditions are not good, they are no worse than they have been during the past two years, during which time our</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">output has greatly increased. There is no great change visible in the political or financial situation; the politicians have no plans which seem on the one hand to be of special service to the people, nor any drastic measures to propose. The extreme left of the Labor party is not strong enough to bring about any drastic change. But the lowering of the selling prices of the books is certainly going to make a great difference to the brethren and in the output. The brethren will be greatly stimulated, especially as they realize the possibilities of wider and greater service. Here is our opportunity while the winds of trouble are quiet. The brethren are looking forward to putting out the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom for the Peoples</span><span class="font2"> booklet. They want to give a witness to the peoples, both to the rulers and the ruled, that God is establishing his kingdom, having set his King upon his holy hill, and specially to tell the people that the time of freedom has come; that those who will seek the face of the Lord may realize it, and that God will soon break down all the bonds which have held the human family under Satanic organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While the showing is very good for the year, the donations are £1,150 short of what they were in 1926; but that is a good amount for the country in its present condition. However, the brethren have not been put to so much local expense in public meetings as in former year's, and it appears that the amount might have well been more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I think it may be said that the paper-covered </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance </span><span class="font2">book has been the outstanding feature of the sales. I am glad we had such a large quantity. The new issue of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott</span><span class="font2"> is much appreciated. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book,</span><span class="font2"> of which we sold 5,719, has been profitable in every way and specially is an encouragement to the brethren. I believe the book has done much to lift the brethren into a newer and better conception of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We are all glad to have a share in the work of the Lord, the greatest of all works; and we want to live up to our privilege and responsibility. I speak for all the loyal and faithful brethren in Britain in regard to our appreciation of all that is done for us in providing us with means of service, and also in sending to you their love. To this I</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The Lord’s blessing has been upon the work in Canada during the fiscal year. That is a broad expanse of territory, much of it thinly populated and hard to work. The zealous anointed ones of the Lord, however, have pushed on in the work; and the results bear evidence that the Lord has added his blessing to their efforts. The radio without doubt has been a great help to the work in Canada. The opposition of the clergy has also helped some because the more they fight, the more the people desire to know what is the cause of the trouble. Generally the clergy pursue the course of quiet hunting, or making all the disturbance without being openly in the fight. In Canada, however, and some places they have been somewhat bolder than this. Their efforts in Toronto during the convention served as a boomerang.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are a great many good Catholic people in Canada who are hindered from hearing the Truth by their prison keepers. The same may be said of the Protestants. The radio is opening the prison doors; and the faithful anointed ones are proceeding to hand in the real food to the prisoners, that they may get strength and come forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The local manager, Brother Salter, has well covered the situation; and the following is quoted from his report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The message we love so well has gone forth with everincreasing momentum; and as a consequence the witness in Canada and Newfoundland has far surpassed in every way any other ever given in the history of the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Perhaps no department of service reflects the Lord’s blessing to a greater degree than that of the Service Department Yet no single department can claim the glory for the-work done; for the service work has gone on as in other years, but a rapid succession of events in which the Lord’s hand has been clearly traceable have led to a happy conclusion. The first event of importance was the dedication of Radio Station CKCX in Toronto, in November. Since then, every new radio station added to the list of those broadcasting the Truth, has meant a permanent increase in book sales. Radio advertises the Truth and paves the way for the placing of the message of the kingdom. To follow up the work a well-organized group of workers was necessary, so that the next step was to arrange the service so that every able-bodied child of God would have a part therein. This was done. Classes large enough to be organized for service work have carried on their work, as previously, through the director; but smaller classes were requested to organize themselves into service units and carry on their work through the secretary, forwarding their reports on forms arranged for the purpose. Isolated friends were asked to report their work as individuals. I feel safe in saying that every one physically fit and fully consecrated in Canada and Newfoundland had some part in the work this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Fewer colporteurs engaged in the work this year than last, owing to the fact that workers hitherto engaging in the service spasmodically were transferred to sharpshooter service. This left an open field for those who were faithfully devoting the proper time to the colporteur work. The result was that while fewer colporteurs were in the active field, their sales have exceeded those of last year, due to increased efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The greatest Increase has been shown in the activities of class workers. The report of almost every class shows that a larger number of workers engaged in the work, a greater number of hours were spent in the service, and their sales show a tremendous increase over last year. Their hearts have been set upon their God, and his .blessing has rested upon them. A number of the classes lying in proximity to each other have been amalgamated and placed under one competent direction insofar as service work is concerned, so that through unity in service each might be strengthened by the warmth of kindred fellowship. This has been much appreciated by the friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sunday canvassing, too, has been taken up with vigor and many report that their sales show a one-hundred-percent increase when canvassing on this day. The Toronto office staff workers, too, are now organized as a separate unit; and their sales contributed in no small measure to the year’s success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">PILGRIM</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The number of pilgrims engaged in the work was five, and auxiliary pilgrims seven, while the attendance at 836 public meetings numbered 121,394, being a decrease of 22,184 as compared with 1926. And at 1,197 class meetings the attendance numbered 75,803, a decrease of 16,467.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Both the classes and the pilgrims feel very much the lack of public interest so far as attendance at public meetings is concerned. It seems that in point of fact very few of the public attend; indeed, the public meetings have been almost entirely composed of the friends. As a consequence the pilgrims feel that so far as the public is concerned they are to a considerable degree but “beating the air”. A public meeting is for the purpose of declaring the plan and purposes of God and his judgments against the present wicked order. To keep on day after day and week after week dedaring the same message to those who constitute a public audience in name only, an audience that knows the plan and Jehovah’s judgment as well as the speaker, is anything but inspiring to the one serving and to the friends who, at much cost and effort, have arranged for the meetings. On the other hand, when the class meetings have been held in the evenings and the pilgrims have taken part in the canvassing work, the blessing therefrom to the friends has been quite marked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SCHOOL TEAMS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Again the Lord’s blessing has rested in no uncertain way upon the activities of the school-team workers. These brethren have very faithfully gone from school to school and place to place with the message of truth, despite the past season being one in which service was rendered with difficulty owing to rains for many months being exceptionally heavy; but the results are very gratifying indeed. As compared with last year they are as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">$1.27</span></p></td></tr>
</table>
<p><span class="font2">While the above comparison shows a slight decrease both in attendance and sales, this is more than accounted for by the fact that the unseasonable weather resulted in very small attendance at the many meetings, sometimes the storms being so bad that none were in attendance. The adversary seemed to do his utmost to prevent this service, but the witness was made despite him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">FOREIGN</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FRENCH WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Apart from the activities of the French class at Montreal and the class at Chiswick in Northern Ontario, the witness among the French-speaking people has been largely confined to the colporteur service. These brethren have courageously carried on the attack in the very center of Catholicism, and |ime and time again have met with much opposition by the authorities in the Province of Quebec. They have been arrested, the cases have been fought, and they have been released, the Lord blessing our efforts in defending the brethren in the courts and in each case granting us a victory. Despite our continual victories it seems to in no way deter the vigorous effort of the Catholic clergy, through the police, to stop the witness, and at the present time we have two cases pending in that province.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">GERMAN WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Owing to the fact that the German-speaking brethren find themselves through force of circumstances almost entirely engaged in providing things necessary, few indeed appear to have time to engage actively in the service work among their own people. During the year the witnessing to people of that nationality through public meetings was practically at a standstill, while there were no German colporteurs in the field. It is our hope, though, during the coming year to have a school team of German-speaking brethren visit the various German settlements, putting on meetings In their school houses and doing colporteur work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">■UKRAINIAN WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the Lord’s providence few brethren have been raised up among these people capable of serving either as regular or as auxiliary pilgrims. As a consequence that phase of the witnessing has been confined to one or two brethren who could give part time to the service. The witness has been largely confined to the service work, and a considerable testimony thereby has been given. The friends were somewhat disturbed by reason of the activities of the adversary in trying to cause division; but I am glad to report that the unrest did not endure long; The friends quickly discerned the spirit of those who were opposing, and would have nothing to do with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The witness among the foreign-speaking people In this country Is not so great as I would like to see it, by any means; but owing to the fact that the foreign-speaking brethren are scattered over a tremendous territory, that few indeed seem to have time to give to the service, it seems impossible to make the witness one would like. However, the Lord in his own due time will, no doubt, raise up the ones he would have serve, to the end that the witness he desires made may be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RADIO</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The witness by means of radio has increased greatly, as reflected in the interest being shown continually by the public. The present fiscal year opened with three stations in this country broadcasting the message of Truth; namely, the ones In Saskatoon, Edmonton and Vancouver. In November of the year, CKCX at Toronto was officially opened by you; and as you are aware, the audience upon that occasion was very great, evidenced in the correspondence, telegrams and telephone messages received. Through these four stations a mighty witness has been given; but the Lord has determined that the radio activities in this country shall not be confined to these four, and as a consequence has opened the way whereby we are now broadcasting over twelve stations in Canada, including the four above mentioned, and during the year have occasionally broadcast from a radio station in St. John’s, Newfoundland. The stations from which we are now broadcasting are as follows:</span></p>

</table>
<p><span class="font2">At all the stations above, excepting St. John’s, Newfoundland, programs are being broadcast regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Great as has been the witness through the regular broadcasts from these stations, the climax of all witnessing in Canada came upon the occasion of the general convention in Toronto through the tremendous hook-up of fifty-three stations, the greatest hook-up the earth had ever known up to that time. Upon this occasion, in the Lord’s providence, you were blessed with the privilege of delivering the message, which was the greatest witness, beyond all question of doubt, ever given of the Truth upon the face of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Year upon year the witness seems to reach a climax beyond which it would appear impossible to go, until the kingdom be fully established; and yet each year reveals a greater witness. How manifestly the Lord’s blessing is upon his people in their every effort to testify to the presence of the King and his kingdom!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVENTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All told, sixteen conventions were held, of which eight were for the English-speaking brethren and eight for the foreign. All the conventions seemed to be, as always, used of the Lord for the blessing and encouragement of his people; and while that is true regarding them as a whole, it is particularly true regarding the international convention held in Toronto. It was used not alone as an occasion for a mighty witness, but did encourage his people to a very marked degree, causing them to return to their homes more determined than ever to spend and be spent in his service, which condition is revealed not alone by the correspondence received from the friends since their return but also by the immediate increase in general results in the service work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">CLASSES IN GENERAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The classes everywhere have, on the whole, become better organized than ever before to carry on the work committed to their care. This applies not alone to the service work but to the activities of the classes in general. However, when a class has reorganized and put its activities upon an efficient basis there have been those who have objected and contended against doing things efficiently. This opposition has not been general, but has been confined to one or two classes. The suggestion in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font2"> some time ago that it would be well for the chairman and the secretary to be changed once every two years, was not received very kindly by some brethren in Vancouver ; and as a consequence before very long they found cause for complaint, resulting in a long-expected division in that class. Today, from reports to hand, those remaining are more united in spirit, joy and zeal than ever before. All feel assured that a greater witness than ever will be carried on in that part of the field. Generally speaking, there has been little of the spirit of division in the classes. All seem to appreciate the Lord’s provision for them in his arrangements in the earth, and with gratitude for the blessings they have received in the Truth are actively engaged in making the witness that is due to be made. Very manifestly they possess the spirit of Elisha; for now in place of the few’, as in years gone by, doing the witness, the church as a whole is testifying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">CANADIAN STAFF</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In speaking of the staff I do not confine the term to the brethren in the office and factory here, but include those who are in charge of the various radio stations in Western Canada, and am happy to report that all members are very faithfully and zealously caring for the duties placed in their hands, working together as one man, to the Lord’s praise and glory, and as a consequence are experiencing great peace of heart and mind and abounding in the joy of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">THE WATCH TOWER</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I feel that this report would not be complete if I failed to mention the strength and joy received by the friends everywhere through the articles contained in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower, </span><span class="font2">brightening their pathway and strengthening their resolution to spend and be spent in the service of our King. When I express my own appreciation and gratitude I speak the sentiment of all the Lord’s people in this country. At the same time I would like to express also the great love of us all for you personally as a servant of the Lord, having oversight of all the churches, and to assure you of our loyal and faithful cooperation in your efforts to bear testimony to the King and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">AUSTRALIA</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark165"></a><span class="font3">Australia is a large country in area. It is a part of Christendom., and it is manifest that the Lord will there have the witness given. The brethren are earnest and zealous, and the Lord’s blessing has been upon them, and during the year they have accomplished more than in any previous year: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures</span><span class="font3"> placed in the hands of the people to the number of 13,929 volumes; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God, Deliverance</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort for the Jews,</span><span class="font3"> 42,098 volumes; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Scenarios</span><span class="font3"> and booklets, 56,825. This together with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Peoples Pulpit,</span><span class="font3"> free tracts, etc., to the number of 1,258,289, makes a grand total of pieces of literature distributed, 1,371,141.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord has opened the way for broadcasting the Truth in Australia; and while the Society is proceeding with the construction of its own stations under adverse conditions, other stations are permitting the message to be broadcast to the people. In submitting his report the local manager, Brother Johnston, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The past year has been the busiest of our history and the most useful. You will see by our figures that we have almost doubled the output of Studies and booklets for the previous year, having placed 112,852 volumes and other literature. Bearing in mind that this represents books sold and not free literature, we may safely say that this is a record in the history of the branch. The distribution of free literature has not been so great, but we believe better results have been secured in that the books paid for will be more likely to be read. Much of this happy result is to be ascribed to the demand for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance,</span><span class="font2"> of which we have placed 12,228 and 21,785 cloth, and 5,965 paper, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The recent I. B. S. A. Week was a great inspiration and encouragement to the brethren here. Sunday colporteuring was approached with some trepidation by those who feared to offend the conservative susceptibilities of the public. The result was a joyful surprise. Few offered any objection whatever; and a greater number of books were sold on the two Sundays than during the week. Many who had never been out before ventured during I. B. S. A. Week, and the Lord blessed their labors with success. I confidently anticipate a greater interest in the service work and larger returns as a result of that effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While in the Lord’s providence we are held up by government inactivity in the building of our radio station, we are nevertheless on the air in various parts of the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The kingdom message is attracting attention wherever broadcast, and adding to the sale of books in these districts. I am very grateful to the Lord for these privileges of service and also for the valued assistance of the staff of the Australian branch and the earnest cooperation of the classes and brethren throughout Australia and New Zealand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I take the occasion also to express the appreciation of the brethren in Australasia of the great help received from yourself and the dear brethren at Brooklyn, financially and otherwise.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark166"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark167"></a>ARGENTINE, SOUTH AMERICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The workers in the Argentine Republic of South America are few in number, but they are zealously doing their best, and the Lord is blessing their efforts. No colporteur is able to make his expenses; therefore the expense must be borne by the Society. During the year 485 meetings have been held for the interested and the public, with an attendance of 20,855; free tracts distributed to the number of 202,900; letters received 746, dispatched 660; books and booklets sold 4,512; Bibles 121, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> and other miscellaneous publications 1,212; subscriptions to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> 366, and to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3"> 260.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The local manager says: “The Lord has greatly blessed us, and we are very thankful to him. The Service Week was a very fine one. Everyone that could go out went out, even sisters seventy years of age. Everyone is happy and glad, and we are really enjoying the great peace of the Lord.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark168"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark169"></a>ARMENIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">While there are few in Armenia interested in the truth, yet the witness is being given, and the Lord is showing his blessing. The brethren there visit Palestine, Egypt and the French possessions. The following is a quotation from the report of the local manager:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It Is with great joy and thanks toward our heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus, who have strengthened us and offered us opportunity where we visited Palestine, Egypt and France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the year we have visited twenty-six cities and villages, and organized three classes (Furlen, Shullek-Belrut, Aleppo and Mareill).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thirty-nine public meetings have been held, with an attendance of 3,850; and 91 class meetings, with an attendance of 2,220.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Photo-Drama of Creation was shown, arousing great interest. Seventeen times the Photo-Drama of Creation was shown amongst the Armenians, with an attendance of 2,100.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the year we have sold the following books and booklets: Armenian 1,993; Arable 188; English 125; French 90; also 1,135 were given freely to those who really were too poor to buy but are highly interested in the Truth; and also 2,320 Armenian </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font2"> were freely distributed or sent to different parts. Also 3,700 copies of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">World Powers Addressed</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Message of Hope</span><span class="font2"> were distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">AUSTRIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The work in Austria has been under a great handicap for the past few years. The fiscal year 1927, however, shows a wonderful increase and a great impetus thereto. The zeal of the brethren and their joy in the service are very manifest. The books and literature placed in the hands of the people during the year 1927 were more than twice the amount that went out to the people in 1926. The Austrian people are much in sympathy with Germany ; and because of their better relationship, the work in Austria is done particularly in connection with the Magdeburg office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was found advantageous to have a distributing depot in Vienna instead of a more expensive family that had been maintained. The books and literature are shipped from Magdeburg, where they are published, and reshipped from our depot at Vienna. The classes are encouraged to put but the books and other literature, and this they are doing with a zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark170"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark171"></a>BLIND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The Society makes an effort to carry the witness to those whose natural eyes see not, and to illuminate their minds so they may perceive and understand concerning God’s kingdom. The branch for this part of the work is maintained at Logansport, Indiana. There has been a steady growth in the work for the blind during the fiscal year. In addition to the work that is carried on from Logansport, an effort is made to witness to the blind in Canada, Great Britain and other lands. The radio is opening the way to reach some of the blind who otherwise could not be reached. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3"> is printed in small numbers in the Braille and distributed to Australia, England, Canada as well as the United States and to the public libraries in Chicago and Pittsburgh. During the year this branch has loaned copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3"> to twenty-five readers. After one reads it, it is passed on to another; so that there are probably many more who read it. The prayer-meeting text comments are published monthly and sent to Australia, England, Canada, and the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some do not understand the meaning of the word Braille. That means a kind of printing for the blind. It is not a language, and it cannot be read with the eyes, but is read by following with the fingers. It is a method of printing for the blind. It requires a great deal of work to print a book in the revised Braille. One-half of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font3"> requires three volumes and costs nine dollar’s to produce. Booklets, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort for the People, A Desirable Government,</span><span class="font3"> each in a large volume, cost one dollar to produce. Articles from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font3"> three dollars per year to produce them. These publications, however, are loaned from the Society’s branch office at 1210 Spear Street, Logansport, Indiana, to any blind readers who desire them. Brother A. L. Ball is the local manager. Colporteurs and class workers can aid the blind with whom they come in contact by communicating to them how they can get literature for their benefit.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark172"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark173"></a>BRAZIL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The witness work in Brazil is young; but yet it is proceeding in a healthy way, and many are given opportunity to hear the message of the Truth. During the year there have been 55 public meetings, attended by </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2,891</span><span class="font3"> persons. There are now seven classes in Brazil, meeting together for regular study. These are organized for the service work and participate therein,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year 431 regular meetings have been held by the classes. Eleven have symbolized their consecration. Free tracts have been distributed to the number of 56,100 in the Portuguese language, and other printed matter in other languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is not to be expected that a great many will make a full consecration to do the Lord’s will and be begotten of the holy spirit at this time. The Lord is giving a witness in the earth concerning his name and what his purposes are after the establishment of his kingdom. There are doubtless, however, many hearing who will be in a condition of mind to receive the kingdom in due time. The prospect for the work during the year ensuing seems to be great.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark174"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark175"></a>BRITISH GUIANA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">When it is considered that the anointed ones in British Guiana are few in number, and the people generally very poor, and other handicaps, the result of the year’s work in that land brings joy to one’s heart. During the year books and booklets have been placed in the hands of the people to the number of 8,559. We can do no better in making this report than quote the following, from that which comes from Brother Phillips, the local manager of the British Guiana branch:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have much to be grateful to the Lord for, when we review our experiences during this period; for in spite of unprecedented drawbacks we have been able to do more work than usual, and have had many instances of the Father’s loving care and protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This year we had no drought, but the opposite, heavy rains from January to August, which hindered our work for eight long months! However, the workers rose to the occasion; and we now have an average of 35 In the field, as against 12 in 1926.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Most of our work Is done on Sundays, as the people are too poor to buy on any other day; and, judging by the monthly </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletins,</span><span class="font2"> etc., we seem to be among the pioneers in this feature of the work, having started to specialize in it during 1925! Although the idea of the ancient “ecclesiastical Sabbath” is still strongly entrenched here, we have found none who object to our work on such days, as, indeed, they cannot with reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The advent of 5,000 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font2"> books in the paper edition served to stimulate our zeal considerably; and we have great pleasure in reporting that this shipment, which arrived in February and which would normally have lasted us for three years, has now been completely sold out. We regret that we cannot obtain more copies of this edition, as the price is just right for the poor people here. However, we are looking forward to great service with the new booklet, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom for the Peoples,</span><span class="font2"> a shipment of which has just come to hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As already reported, the Easter season was one of great joy to us, as twenty workers traveled to the country of Berbice, and, joining the six workers there, covered practically the whole of that territory with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance,</span><span class="font2"> 1,000 copies of which were sold in four days. We also had the pleasure of partaking of the Memorial there; and the campaign was brought to a close with a public lecture in the Town Hall, New Amsterdam, the subject being “The Destiny of Men and Nations”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If poverty were not reigning supreme here at present, we should be able to do much more work; for under these conditions the people cannot afford to buy more than one book at a time. We have, therefore, to cover the territory over and over again. This Increases our expenses considerably; but we are still content to “spend and be spent” in the Master’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our work for 1927 has been confined to the counties of Demerara and Berbice, which we have quite covered, with the exception of some small patches; but we are arranging for a thorough canvass of the county of Essequibo, which has not been tackled for some years. The result will be included in our 1928 report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The distribution of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Testimony</span><span class="font2"> tract was joyfully undertaken, and a copy mailed to every preacher in the Colony. With the exception of one little fellow, who gave a yap or two, these dumb ones held their peace, and endeavored to appear wise! All the rulers, great and small, were also served.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Although the average attendance is a little less than in 1926, the Class in Georgetown is in good condition; and the workers (We wish we need make no difference!) continue to joyfully and enthusiastically do the Lord’s work in his way. We find so much joy in the service that we sometimes wonder if there is any more joy laid up for us in the future!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Throughout the year the Father has preserved and encouraged us, by the feasts in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font2"> reports of the great conventions, and the manifest blessings in the new arrangements at Headquarters. We are striving to be sufficiently grateful to him for all his favors, and to be worthy of a part in the first resurrection.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark176"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark177"></a>COLORED</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord has shown by his blessing added that it -was his will that a separate branch of the work be carried on for the Colored brethren in America. That is not because there is any distinction between Christians by reason of color, but it is because it affords a better opportunity to reach some who are prejudiced. There is no reason why the Colored brethren should not meet with their white brethren in class study; but when it comes to the public witness work, a separate arrangement is much more effective amongst the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord has opened the way for broadcasting the message especially to the Colored brethren during the year and has blessed the effort put forth in this behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Only one brother is regularly and exclusively engaged in the pilgrim service, while other brethren devote some time to it. The classes generally are in good condition, and are participating in the service work:</span></p>

</table>
<p><span class="font3">From the report of Brother Banks, who devotes his time to the Colored work, the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One year ago the report covered approximately seventeen months, which should be kept in mind when noting the data of this report, which covers twelve months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The blessings of the Lord are and have been in evidence throughout the year. The brethren for the most part are in harmony with the increased light now shining from God’s Temple. Many show their appreciation, gratitude and love by their activity in the service, “love indeed.” In the past, many floated upon sentimental love and rejoiced in it. But under the brighter light, that does not suffice. Nothing short of actual work brings that satisfying portion to the heart that yearns for a “closer walk with God” and his approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Of course there are some who do not see “eye to eye” with us since the Lord has fulfilled his promise to “bring again Zion”, and who are correspondingly sitting in darkness. I have in mind a man who rejected the Society in 1917, and his own testimony supports the above. He claims that no light has emanated therefrom since the death of Brother Bussell in 1916. He delivered a discourse in 1927; and it was remarked by one who heard him that “it was the same talk he gave eleven years ago, word for word”. Thus counting back eleven years from 1927 we find him standing where he was in 1916.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have been able to enter many more churches this year than last. This we believe is because of the independent thought and action of some of the clergy who are becoming enlightened, and who have a measure of honesty and Interest in their congregations. Although generally they are relentless insofar as the public is concerned, yet behind closed doors they read our publications and acknowledge the truthfulness of the teachings. I have been able to get into the largest churches in some of the largest cities of the south, viz.: Memphis, Atlanta, Montgomery, Ala., Vicksburg, Miss., Newbern, N. C-, and Mobile, Ala.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By allowing two days where we formerly had but one, we have been able to serve more people this year than last, even though this does not show in figures In the report. The number of meetings is less, but the witness has been much wider, because many who have been served would not have had the courage to secure a parole or to steal away from the prison (house) to hear the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I am of the opinion that service is one of the tests used by the Lord at this time. When once the great commission is seen, those who have a zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house readily find expression in the distribution of the literature provided for the purpose.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark178"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark179"></a>CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">There are not a great many classes in Czechoslovakia, but these are doing as best they can to give the witness. The conditions in that country are not favorable. The organization, however, is being strengthened; and we hope for better results in another year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year thirteen public meetings have been held, attendance 2,360; class meetings 1,907, attendance of 24,668. Six colporteurs have been actively engaged in the field work. 9,600 copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3"> have been distributed; free tracts 1,050,000.

<h2><a name="bookmark183"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark184"></a>DENMARK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">In Denmark the work has taken on a real impetus during the fiscal year. The sale of books and booklets in that small country aggregated during the year 134,377; free tracts distributed 331,100. There are only seventy-three classes in Denmark, and only fifty-nine of these are organized for service. Out of that number 381 have engaged in the service work, sixteen in the colporteur service and eight in the auxiliary colporteur service. There has been an average of 177 in the field each week, including colporteurs, auxiliary colporteurs and class workers. Two are engaged in the pilgrim service. These have held meetings for the interested to the number of 511, with an attendance of 9,163; public meetings 301, with an attendance of 17,036.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to this the message has been sent out on the opposite side of folders to the number of 219,675. Letters were received to the number of 3,323; sent out 6,205. From the local manager the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the report of the work for last year I said that we were confident that we would be spurred on by the increased results of that year, and that we would reach forward for better results for this year; and our confidence has not been put to shame, and the praise for it belongs to the Lord. As the report shows, 134,377 books have been put out from the office; and that means an increase of 42,362 books, a result we could hardly have dreamt about in this country a few years back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another encouraging feature is an increase in the classes from sixty-six to seventy-three, an increase in classes organized for service from forty-five to fifty-nine, and further an increase of service workers from 325 to 381. The number of whole-time colporteurs has increased from six to eighteen, and of auxiliary colporteurs from five to eight. The number of subscribers to the Danish </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font2"> has increased from 1,144 to 2,027. We can therefore say that there has been an advance movement all over in spite of the hard times, or perhaps, because of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Encouraged by these increased figures we yet lay more weight on the fact that the influence of the witnessing is being felt more and more. Although a great number of the Danish people are very indifferent in religious matters, yet it seems as though a greater and greater number now get their eyes opened to the fact that a message is going out about the kingdom which is to bless the people and solve the many social difficulties, and bring help to the great numbers in distress because they are without employment.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark185"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark186"></a>ESTHONIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Another new part of the field is Esthonia, one of the Baltic Sea states. There has been a decided increase there in the work during the fiscal year. The Lord has opened the way to have the message broadcast by radio and this is giving the work a real start. From the local manager’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Last year the total number of books sent out from the office was just under 1,000. This year it is over 10,000. Surely our hearts rejoice in the manifest blessing of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the little army here we have had brethren from four different countries and yet it has been wonderful to note the oneness of spirit; all intent upon showing forth the praises of the Lord and making known the glories of his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Through the Northern European Office, arrangements were made for two colporteurs to come from Germany and work in Esthonia. This proved a good arrangement and many books were put in the hands of the people. As we might expect we had opposition. When application was made for extension of visas for these brethren we were refused and an article appeared in the biggest newspaper and a cartoon in a smaller one. As usual the purpose of the article was to try to ridicule our work and it as good as suggested that we regarded the word Esthonian as synonymous with ignoramus. A letter was sent from the office to the editor, explaining our purposes and what we believe. He of course then wanted to get out of the hole he was in and it was not until he was informed that we would print a newspaper ourselves explaining everything to the Esthonian people, that he agreed to print our letter; he looked just like a dog does when it carries its tail between its legs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After our German brethren had had to leave the country arrangements were made between the Northern European and Finnish offices to send two Finnish colporteurs here. Owing to the good relationship existing between Finland and Esthonia, no vises are required and these two colporteur sisters have been working here for the last three months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord will doubtless increase the laborers in this field. During the last month, two interested friends have started canvassing and another has just started as an auxiliary colporteur. The public meetings although not numerous have been well attended and much interest manifested by those present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Permission was obtained to use the radio and I spoke on the “Blessings of the Millennium”, the talk being interpreted into Esthonian. Further permission for a regular broadcast was refused on the grounds that they had already broadcast two church services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We shall, however, try again to obtain permission. The effect the radio talk had upon the canvassing was wonderful, and many who had not heard the talk themselves had heard of it and wished to purchase the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The clergy have threatened to have me thrown out of the country; and our German brethren making application for vises have been refused, when it has been found out that they are coming to visit “this West”, as they said at the consulate. In spite of it all, however, I have just obtained permission from the Ministry of the Interior to remain in Esthonia until July, 1928.—Isaiah 51:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In conclusion I would like to express my appreciation of the privilege I have had of attending various conventions in Northern Europe. Through the good offices of our Brother Dey these conventions have always been, as it were, company meetings with a view to increased efficiency in the Lord’s business, and I have always left feeling more determined than ever to do my share in the wonderful work of witnessing.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark187"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark188"></a>FINLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">In Finland during the fiscal year some have yielded to the assaults of the enemy and fallen aside; but the faithful have stood firm, and their efforts have been greatly blessed by the Lord and show a decided increase in the work that has been accomplished in witnessing for the kingdom. Books and booklets put into the hands of the people during the year to the number of 128,034; free tracts distributed, 258,642. Number of classes sixtyseven, organized for service fifty-three. Service workers, including colporteurs and auxiliaries, 575; average workers per week 238; pilgrims in the service three. Meetings held for the interested 2,639, attendance 68,251; public meetings 815, attendance 64,726.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The local manager, Brother Harteva, in submitting his report says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the end of this wonderful year in the Lord’s service, it is my great privilege to send you the report of the work done In Finland. It has been the best year for the truth In our country. Truly the great opposition which commenced last year has still continued with great effort, and a good number have left us during the year; but It has only helped the remnant to do more in the Lord’s service. Those who opposed the work were as brakes; but we decided to work so energetically that the brakes would grow hot and fall off. That was also the case, and the work has prospered marvelously. As an interesting example I can mention the last I. B. S. A. Week. Last year we sold during this week 1,493 books and 9,344 booklets, or together 10,837; but this year we sold 5,451 books and 18,872 booklets, or together 24,323. It was especially encouraging to note that the sales of books have been nearly quadrupled. The I. B. S. A. Week was a splendid time, which was very markedly blessed by our dear Lord. When the friends sent their reports over the week, their letters overflowed with joy and gratitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Although the number of friends has decreased, yet the number of workers has increased from 358 to 621, and so the sold books have increased from 73,470 to 121,879, or about sixty-flve percent. The friends appreciate more and more their privileges, and so the good work is going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The work now in Northern Europe is very pleasant. We feel the close unity of the work and it is a good help for the work. In this connection I like to express our often deeply felt gratitude for the great work the dear Lord is doing through you also for our country, and it is a joy for me to tell you that we appreciate very much the untiring and unselfish loving work done by our dear Brother Dey. It has been a great stimulus for us.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark189"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark190"></a>FRANCE AND BELGIUM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The people in these two countries speak the French language. For some reason difficult to explain they have not taken enthusiastically to the message of the Lord’s kingdom. There is, however, a slight increase over 1926. Some of the elders in the classes failed to recognize the importance of the time in which we are living and the necessity to proclaim the message, while other classes are showing a greater zeal. A local depot for the French work is situated at Strasbourg. It is under direct supervision from the Berne office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">POLISH WORK IN PRANCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are a great many Polish-speaking people in northern France. During the year, 180 of these symbolized their consecration and classes have been organized among them. More than thirty thousand booklets have been sold amongst the people in that section during the year. It is marked that those who come to a knowledge of the Truth at once show a burning zeal to do something in the Lord’s name. Recently a Polish brother has been put into the field to visit the classes, and a number of Polish-speaking brethren have entered the pilgrim service in Northern France. The colporteurs that are working in France report some very encouraging experiences.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark191"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark192"></a>GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">AU who are consecrated to the Lord realize that in themselves there is no strength and of their own power they can accomplish nothing. Meekness, meaning a proper appreciation of oneself, and humility, meaning fuU obedience to the Lord’s commandments, are necessary to success. Without these nothing can be accomplished. Where the spirit of the Lord is and the brethren go forth in the name and in the strength of the Lord, great things can be accomplished in his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A few years ago there was not very much interest in the kingdom in Germany; but since 1922, the work has greatly increased. The fiscal year of 1927 surpasses anything that had yet been accomplished. Credit for this cannot be given to the German people, but must be given to the Lord. But it must be said of the German brethren whom the Lord has used to do this work, that only those who are unselfishly devoted to God have accomplished results. Like other countries, some have become weary in well doing and stepped aside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Others have stumbled over the message of the kingdom and fallen, and have become opponents to the Truth. Some of these have engaged in violent accusations against some of the Society’s servants, but none of these things have in any wise hindered the work. The Lord is at the helm, and it has gone grandly on. It is a great consolation to see how the Lord has blessed the work year after year. When the war was ended the Society had practically nothing in Germany. Today it has a home for those who are at the headquarters at Magdeburg, and a factory for the printing of literature and manufacture of books; and these are paid for. It is true, a great amount of this money has been sent from America; but the Lord’s consecrated have had the privilege by his grace to do the work, and through them he has provided the things needful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the fiscal year the factory at Magdeburg has produced 766,000 bound volumes and 3,045,000 booklets, and 17,100,000 other pieces of literature. This is far in excess of what was done in any previous year. In addition to this, copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3"> have been produced to the number of 840,300, and copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> to the number of 7,338,200. This has furnished a tremendous amount of food for the minds of those who desire to know of God’s plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">FIELD SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those who are thoroughly devoted to the Lord are organized for the service work. During the fiscal year they have placed in the hands of the people, books and booklets as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures</span><span class="font2"> (German) 156,505</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures</span><span class="font2"> (other languages) 270</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Harp of God</span><span class="font2"> (German) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;140,424</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Harp of God</span><span class="font2"> (other languages) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;350</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font2"> (German) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;387,777</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort for the Jews</span><span class="font2"> and other bound books 110,147 Booklets (German) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2,233,220</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Booklets (other languages) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6,100</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Free tracts have been distributed to the number of 7,115,000; and the total of books sold by colporteurs and class workers during the year is 794,853, booklets 2,233,220, or a grand total of 3,028,073. In addition to this the office force has carried on a large correspondence. Letters received 99,398, and letters dispatched 69,893.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our German brethren have not been without difficulties, however. The enemy’s organization has sought to destroy the work. During the year brethren have been arrested to the number of 1,169, which actions were brought into court. Three hundred fifty-three of these have already been determined, out of which forty were punished and three hundred thirteen discharged. There are still pending eight hundred sixteen actions against the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">They are nobly and earnestly contending for the faith once delivered to the saints, and the Lord is blessing their efforts. Notwithstanding this, the brethren have gone on with the public meetings and private meetings and conventions; and the Lord has kept his hand over them and blessed their efforts. The following is a rSsumd of these meetings:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Public meetings &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,113</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Attendance &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;201,619</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Meetings for Interested friends &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29,016</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Attendance &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;774,266</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Meetings for the brethren &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;56,668</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Attendance &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,603,367</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The following is a quotation from the report of Brother Balzereit, the local manager:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The numbers of this report are strong support for the thoughts which </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font2"> has given us in the last Tear as meat in due season. It manifests that the Lord has come to his temple, and that in the test now upon the church only a remnant will remain. Many of those who were active in the work in the last year were not firm in the test; but the wonderful result is that beside of this fact and beside of the fact that less public lectures were held, the distribution of literature has increased in great measure. The reason is that only the true and faithful ones remain on the Lord’s side, and they go on with strength and joy to do what is needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The fact is that indifferent Christians not only themselves do nothing, but are a hindrance to what could be done; and therefore it is better that they go away. From the report can be seen that in 1927, 386,057 books (bound books) more were sold than in 1926. The interest of the public has much increased, as is manifest from the fact that the edition of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> has jumped from 270,000 to 320,000. Although the number of class workers is less than in the last year, yet from statistics based on the registration forms it can be seen that while twenty percent of the brethren who purposed to go in the field were hindered by whatever was said, twenty percent more are ready to have a part in the work. Further, we regret to have the fact that despite all exhortations some classes send no reports to this office. What we want is not the number of the workers but the results, and the results show the truth of what you said in Berlin: “Go to the front or away.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Also the printery has achieved greater results. There are 71,000 bound books and 333,000 booklets produced more. It must be added that the greatest part of these booklets is covered, and in the last year without cover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font2"> book has done a wonderful work, and especially the instruction of the head office regarding the second canvass. Reports from some brethren show that they visited purchasers of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font2"> book after the sending of the folders; and that according to the method recommended by the head office, each second reader of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font2"> book took a set of seven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The climax of the witness in Germany for 1927 without doubt was the convention in Berlin and your public lecture in connection with it. Fifteen thousand hearers in and the same number who could not have entrance prove the great desire which the people have to hear the message of the kingdom. We know of fifty great and smaller newspapers that have published reports of your lecture, a great part of it in very fine manner; but there is no doubt that many more newspapers have published the report of your lecture, because we have no knowledge of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At times we have a great further work in Berlin, arranging at first five great lectures in various places in the greatest halls of Berlin on the topic: “Freedom for the Peoples.” Then will follow in various parts of the capital the organizing of classes. It was necessary to have in Berlin a small office for the Society, for the delivering of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> and literature and for answering all the inquiries daily coming in. Further, on next Sunday there will be 2,600 brethren from the towns near Berlin to have a great further canvass all over the capital. In this way we hope to have great results, and the impression of the convention and your public lecture will be much enlarged.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark193"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark194"></a>HOLLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">There are only a few small classes in Holland fully consecrated to the Lord, but these have had the blessing of the Lord during the year. The output of the literature has doubled that of the year 1926. During Service Week the brethren made a splendid record. The local branch office of Holland is now at Haarlem. From the local manager’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The work in Holland exists five years now; and though during the recent years the number of workers has not Increased, the work is increasing every year. We think this is due to the fact that the Lord is giving more light upon his Word of Truth, and thereby the friends more and more appreciate their privileges in the spreading of the glad tidings of the kingdom. Especially the last year was marked by a zealous engaging in the service work as never before. The result was that double as much literature was placed into the hands of the people, in comparison with the year before. The friends are very blessed by the studying of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font2"> which we have had now two years in our language. We have about 300 subscribers now. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font2"> study in the class meetings resulted in two things: (a) Joy on one side, manifested by a greater zeal for the Lord’s cause; and (b) stumbling and falling away of those who were not prompted by pure love for the Lord. The Lord is in his temple, and the work of refining is going on! During the year seventeen friends symbolized their consecration by water immersion, and about as many have fallen away from the Lord’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the year there were two regular colporteurs engaged in the work. Now the new year has begun; and we note already three colporteurs, two sisters and one brother; and we have reason to expect that this number will increase during the coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the report of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font2"> about Holland we read: “The work in Holland plods along.” And at the convention in The Hague, Brother Rutherford said: “The work has been going like an ox-cart.” But now the work has become already a slow train, and next year we hope it to be like an aeroplane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A feature of the work of this year has been the I. B. S. A. Week, the first ever held in Holland. We did not expect to sell so much; but when the week had ended, we found a total of 1,893 books placed in the hands of the people. So we see that the Lord is blessing us, if we are working together in harmony with the arrangements which he announces to us through his channel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The total sale of books and booklets during the year was 23,668.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark195"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark196"></a>HUNGARY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Until quite recently the work in Hungary has been under the supervision of the Cluj office in Eoumania. The work is now being reorganized, and will be more directly under the supervision of the Magdeburg office. There are about twenty-five classes of consecrated brethren in Hungary, and these are organized for the service work. Free tracts containing the radio lectures that appear in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> are being distributed in the country. Pilgrims are also being sent about to visit the classes.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark197"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark198"></a>INDIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord continues to favor his faithful witnesses in India and to bless their efforts as they seek to give the witness to his name. Brethren in other parts of the world can hardly appreciate the difficulties under which the work is done in India. That land has a population of 300,000,000 persons. About four millions of these call themselves Christians; out of that number 260,000 are Anglo-Indians, and the remaining seventy percent are very illiterate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the report of the local manager at Bombay the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our work has divided itself into three groups: (1) European and Anglo-Indian; (2) Native Christian; (3) NonChristian. The native Christian work is chiefly confined to Travancore district, under the direct supervision of Brother Joseph. This field is quite a large one, and many are interested in the Truth and zealous for the Lord. The standard of living of these poor souls is very low, the average wage of a worker is equivalent to about 15 cents per day; and therefore few are able to buy books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The work in this field has been somewhat reorganized during the year. In addition to the four pilgrims previously engaged, five other native brethren have been engaged in public witness work, and four colporteurs have made a noble effort to witness for the Lord. There has been much activity, and many have heard the truth, but few are able to buy books; and as the policy of giving them away freely was discontinued during this year, the output has been lower than previously. 287 meetings have been held, attended by about 17,000 people. Many of these meetings have to be held in improvised shelters away in the jungle. There are 25 classes where regular meetings are held, and the friends seem to be in a healthy spiritual condition and zealous for the Lord. A translation of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Testimony</span><span class="font2"> was made during the year and 50,000 copies distributed. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Watch Tower</span><span class="font2"> has recently been published in the local vernacular as a monthly magazine, much to the joy of the brethren; and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Harp</span><span class="font2"> is also on the press. This will furnish the friends with a means of acquiring a more thorough knowledge of the truth. Altogether there have been 1,153 books disposed of (including booklets), in the vernacular tongues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">English work: Work amongst the English communities has been opened out during the year with good results. The type of Englishman in this part of the world is chiefly of the “boss” class, and is more interested in trying to prop up the Devil’s organization than in paying much attention to Messiah’s kingdom; but in spite of this many have been found ready to purchase the literature of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Scattered along the various railway systems there are a number of colonies of English people who are employed on the railway. Many of these colonies have been visited during the year, meetings have been held and the people canvassed. The results have been gratifying. Some consist of only a mere handful of bungalows by the side of a village station without any accommodations for visitors, and one has to stay overnight in the waiting-room; others are fair-sized towns offering much scope for work. The few English brethren here are mostly railway or telegraph employees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Efforts have been made during the year to organize the classes for service. A monthly </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font2"> has been issued each month for this purpose, but the response has not been up to</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">expectations. One or two are zealous for the Lord, but are handicapped by being in places where scope for English work is limited. In Rangoon (Burma) and Colombo (Ceylon) there are small classes organized; and we hope to see much increase of effort in these places during the coming year. Bombay has a large English community, and much canvass work has been done. A class is now formed, and I. B. S. A. Week saw their first active effort in being united witnesses for the Lord. It was a happy time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Testimony</span><span class="font2"> was translated into Malayalam, Marathi, Sinhalese, and Urdu; and an aggregate of 75,000 copies distributed, together with 75,000 copies of the English edition. The Viceroy and each of the Provincial Governors was Served with one, and each in turn acknowledged the receipt Of it. Copies were also mailed to all the clergy and missionaries whose names could be secured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Considering the few workers available for the English work, the results have been encouraging. The Lord has manifested his approval, his love and his care upon us, and given us grace and strength to serve him by being his witnesses in a country where the Devil has long held his tyrannical sway. Altogether there have been sold in the English language 5,063 bound volumes (including the paper </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance)</span><span class="font2"> and 3,004 booklets, whilst 53 meetings have been attended by 1,450 people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Non-Christian: The great mass of educated Indians are not easily amenable to Christianity. This is no doubt due to the harmful influence of hypocritical “Christendom”. Canvass work has been commenced in this field and there has been found a fairly ready sale for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font2"> book amongst a certain community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The prospects for the coming year are hopeful. The work of distributing the Toronto Resolution booklet is eagerly anticipated. The field is great, but the laborers are very few. We look to the Lord to use whatever means he shall choose to spread his name abroad in the land. A limited use of the radio is just now made available at the moment of writing and we hope for more facilities in this direction in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year bound volumes in the English have been placed in the hands of the people to the number of 5,063, booklets 3,004, vernacular of various kinds 1,153, making a total of 9,220. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Testimony</span><span class="font3"> in tract form has been distributed in various languages to the number of 150,000.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark199"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark200"></a>ITALY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The work in Italy has had many interruptions during the year. Mussolini’s reign of terror, aided and abetted by the Papal system, has greatly retarded the work of witnessing for the kingdom in Italy. Much of our literature was seized and confiscated. Some of the Catholic priests declared that the Inquisition methods should be employed to punish the heretics. Italy is in a bad way. The following is quoted from a business man recently from Rome:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The pressure of the Italian military government is so great, and they are so oppressing the people, that an explosion is likely to follow at any time. The government does not seem to recognize the real danger, and that this lies in the fact that the people are oppressed and all the nations are preparing madly for war. The governments rely upon their armies, and in this they are making a great blunder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But the work has not been entirely stopped in Italy. Brother Cuminetti, the local manager, says concerning the persecution:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With all this we are not discouraged. Our joy in the Lord has not been dampened, because we see with our eyes the King moving forward triumphantly. We will keep on proclaiming the message as best we can.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark201"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark202"></a>JAMAICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord is having the witness given in the British West Indies. Jamaica is the local headquarters. The work during the year has progressed, notwithstanding opposition. The following is a condensed report of the work during the past year:</span></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark214"><span class="font2">Conventions held during the year</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark215"><span class="font2">Number in attendance</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the local manager’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The year has been a very remarkable one, rich in blessings for all who are engaged in the Lord’s work. Our prayer for opportunity to serve has been wonderfully answered. Never before has the opportunity for service been so general and the joy of service so great as at the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The last Service Week has marked a new era for Jamaica along the line of service, and the result of that week of service has been very gratifying and stimulating. The Sunday service from door to door with the message during Service Week was a marked feature of the work, and was highly appreciated both by those who served and those who were served with the wonderful gospel message from the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many who have a knowledge of God’s plan for the establishment of his kingdom on earth have turned their backs to the increasing light, saying that the kingdom message belongs to the past. But notwithstanding their withdrawal, the work is progressing as never before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We truly rejoice to see how the Lord is filling the earth with a knowledge of the truth. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font2"> are two books that are doing a great work among the people, making way for the volumes of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Scripture Studies, </span><span class="font2">which are now being sold at a rate that they have never been sold before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The classes that remain in the Lord’s service are exhibiting much genuine love and zeal for the work with the hope of setting free some of the prisoners who are still in bondage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It gives one much pleasure to note how the Lord is guiding his work here. The fault-finding ones withdraw themselves ; yet they are not missed, because the work goes on at a more rapid rate without them. The faithful ones esteem it the greatest privilege to have a share in this glorious work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The pilgrims appreciate very much the present order of service because it brings them in touch with many who truly appreciate the message. The colporteurs are also having much joy in the Lord’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It gives us the greatest pleasure to cooperate with you and all who are engaged in the glorious work; and we are thankful for the privilege of being thus engaged. We thank you for your kind and loving service in the past, and still crave the same.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark216"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark217"></a>JAPAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">While it can hardly be said that Japan as a country is a part of Christendom, yet there has been a great deal of so-called Christian missionary work done there and doubtless the Lord desires the witness to be given in this land as well as others. He has indicated his will in this regard with the blessings he has placed upon the work in Japan during the past year. It was found to be more economical and more advantageous to have one general branch office to look after the work in Japan and Korea. Accordingly the local office is at Tokio, and the work in Japan and Korea will be managed from this point. The publication of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3"> has begun in Japanese, arid the interest in this is great. The following is a quotation from the local manager’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Classes Established: When I arrived in Japan last September, there was a group of Bible Students in Kobe. They were not organized into a class yet, when I visited them at the end of September. Since then two classes have been established, one in Kobe and the other in Osaka. Elders and deacons are elected for both classes, and service directors were appointed also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Activity of Brethren: There are fifty-two brothers and sisters altogether in Japan. These have all symbolized their consecration since last October. They are so earnest to go out in the Lord’s service. Ninety-five percent of them go out selling books. It is very hard to sell books in Japan, especially when they are Christian books. Japanese people get all tired of these “Christian books” being sold by the nominals. Although the brethren sell a very small number of books, they rejoice in the service just the same. They sell many copies of the Japanese </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Three big public meetings in Tokyo are planned. Tokyo is the capital city of Japan. This great city has 2,300,000 in population now. This city represents- the whole- Far Eastern countries, financially and politically and in all other ways. Now the Lord has graciously opened his way to make known his real name to the people of this great city in the Orient. We are making arrangements to have three big public meetings in October. The program is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">October 10, at the Asahi Hall, which has a seating capacity of 3,200. The topic will be “The Kingdom of God Is at Hand”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">October 16, at the Aoyama Hall (4,000 seats). The topic is to be “Falling Down of the Christian Civilization&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">October 22, at the Honjo Public Hall (1,600). The topic Is to be “Deliverance Is Near”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Free tracts of Toronto Resolution with Brother Rutherford’s discourse and invitations for the meetings will be mailed to 7,000 of all kinds of ofiBcials and business men and others. Three hundred thousand handbills will be distributed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark218"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark219"></a>JUGOSLAVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">There has not been much progress made this year in Jugoslavia. Two brothers have been engaged in the colporteur service. A few small classes of about sixty brethren are doing what they can to give the message to the people. The whole land is shrouded in darkness, and they have a difficult task to get others to hear. The people seem anxious for liberty, but they are kept in bondage. The brethren are planning a greater activity for the year ensuing. The brethren in Jugoslavia are encouraged. While they may not accomplish much, nevertheless they will give the witness which evidently is the chief thing that the Lord desires at this time.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark220"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark221"></a>KOREA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The work in Korea has not been great during the year; but the brethren have been doing the best they can under the circumstances, taking into view the handicaps. It has been thought best since we have established an office in Japan to put all the Korean work under that office; and henceforth it will be handled there until the Lord indicates otherwise.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark222"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark223"></a>LATVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">This is another new part of the field where the work is getting started, even though there is much opposition. The brethren are zealous in their efforts to serve. The number is small, but their courage and faith in the Lord are great. During the year books and booklets have been placed in the hands of the people to the number of 17,788. There are two classes organized, both of which engage in the service work. Fourteen are in the service work, and an average number of seven each week. One is engaged in the pilgrim service. During the year meetings for the friends have been held to the number of 113; attendance 879; public meetings forty-eight, attendance 7,166. Free tracts distributed 65,000. There are two engaged in the colporteur work. Letters received 3,032; dispatched, 233. From the local manager’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The year has been one full of experiences, and especially of many attempts of the Devil to try to close down the work here. But in all the Lord has triumphed, and the work has gone on. In November of last year when I went up to get an extension of my visa, they told me that if I intended to stop here and carry on the work of the Bible Students, I should have to leave the country by January 10 of this year. Only two weeks after this, the government was overthrown by the Socialists, who are still in office; and by the Lord’s grace I am still in Latvia. Then in April we had some German brothers come up to colporteur. They could obtain visds for only one month; and when we applied for renewals they were refused. And for the last six months, at the end of every month they had to travel to Lithuania, there procure a new visa and then come back for another month. Only this week, however, one brother has obtained permission to stay for six months; and we are glad as it seems that these things are being eased up for us. But with all it has been a time of very rich blessing, especially in taking the message of truth to these peoples who are hearing of it for the first' time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have worked considerably among the German part of the population, and now have established three classes of interested ones in the three largest towns. We have also established a class of interested Letts in Riga. It is a joy to see the way these people drink in the Truth and appreciate the meetings that we are having for them. One old Lettish minister said, “I have preached for forty years, but the Lord has kept me waiting until I was seventy-eight before he revealed to me the truths contained in the Word of God.” Many say, “Never in our lives have we heard such wonderful things.” Without doubt we have a large work to do among the Letts; and now that we have the books we can push on with this work. Our work with them has been limited, as we have waited so long for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sarp</span><span class="font2"> and the booklets. At the beginning of September we received these; and twenty of us went forward in I. B. S. A. Week with the new books. And it turned out to be the greatest witness that we have yet given to the Truth in this country. All the reports are not yet in, but well over 4,000 books were sold. We were in three small towns, where the population was seventy percent Jewish, and sold many books to the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The language difficulty diminishes as time goes on, but when I say that we carry books in nine languages on the work, one realizes that it is a real difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In March a small convention was held In Riga with a Lettish and a German public meeting. The brethren were much encouraged by the convention and eveu more so by the results of the meeting.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark224"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark225"></a>LITHUANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">When we consider that the work is really just begun in Lithuania, the results for the fiscal year are very encouraging. The total number of books and booklets placed in the hands of the people aggregate 20,750. In addition thereto, free tracts were distributed to the number of 56,000. Number in the pilgrim service one, public meetings twenty; attendance 4,390. From the local manager's report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For the first part of the year there was more freedom under a Social-Democratic Government; but when it was overthrown by a Fascist! </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">coup d’État</span><span class="font2"> and the clerical party came into power again, the Devil has done his best to repress the Truth. The whole country is under military law, and permits are needful for all public meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Nevertheless twenty meetings were held during the year, though twelve were in the first quarter of it. At all of these there was keen interest. In some instances when the doctrine of hell torment was shown to be unscriptural there was loud applause. There was an attendance of 4,390, and 898 books were sold. Many were the expressions of joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Gradually the Truth is spreading. Now after two years’ work forty-three took part in the Memorial. This year twelve symbolized their consecration to the Lord. After the Mazeikiai convention was advertised in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font2"> for July 31, the authorities refused permission at the last moment. However, eighteen brethren met in a wood near the town. A few weeks later permission was obtained; and 45 met and had a happy time encouraging each other in the Lord and going out in the work. On both of these occasions a mother and two daughters came on foot from a place 114 kilometers away. We have now three wholetime colporteurs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In February Memelgebiet was- transferred to the Lithuanian office; and this seems to have been in the Lord’s providence, as otherwise owing to my visit to America the convention could not have been held. Held it was, however, with the aid of interpreters; and four symbolized at it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Since February the German brethren have spread 5,946 in the Gebiet as well as 5,103 in Lithuania proper. Additionally a further 9,701 were put out by the colporteurs and friends, making a grand total of 20,750 for the whole land.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark226"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark227"></a>NORTHERN EUROPE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The Northern European Office is located at Copenhagen, Denmark. The jurisdiction of this office is Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Esthonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Until recently all literature for these countries was printed by worldly concerns. During the last year it has been possible for the Society to produce books and booklets and other literature for these countries at the factories at Magdeburg and at Berne, Switzerland. This has made it possible to put the books into the hands of the people at a much cheaper rate. Another encouraging matter about the northern part of Europe: The brethren are working together harmoniously, and appreciating the fact that the Lord has called them for a purpose and that they have a work to do; and they are glad to have the opportunity of doing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As an evidence of the increased activity, mention is made of Service Week. In the countries mentioned 1,710 were in the field. They placed 12,316 books and 86,855 booklets, or a total of 99,171, which is an increase of practically 29,000 over that of last year. From the report of Brother Dey, the manager of the Northern European Office, the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The past year has been one of increasing activity and joy, as you would glimpse from beholding our order at Copenhagen. At that convention, by the way, fifty-two symbolized their consecration, and including the 1,100 sold at your meeting, a total of 7,830 books went out. The service day was specially enjoyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This year we have gone from strength to strength. There have been put out 97,294 books; 452,208 booklets and 8,433 Bibles, sermons, etc., a grand total of 554,073. Even after allowing for Memelgebiet, which was taken over from Germany in the year, as it is part of Lithuania, there is an increase of 147,951 in books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Last year fifty-three colporteurs and thirty auxiliaries put out 108,134; this year seventy-three colporteurs and forty-two auxiliaries spread 167,914. Then, as you will see from the detailed reports, the classes have done splendidly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In I. B. S. A. Week the weather was wet, but it did not dampen our enthusiasm. One thousand seven hundred and ten brethren sallied forth and sold 99,171, of which 12,316 were bound books. It was a joyous time; and, as people who do know their God, they “did exploits”. One sister in Sweden sold 541, of which about 300 were volumes, including ten sets of eight; another in Denmark sold 700; while one brother doing country witness work in Hammerfest, the most northern town in Europe, sold 115 volumes and 853 booklets; and another in Finland made 618. In Esthonia two English brethren, two Finnish sisters and a native sold 1,520, and in Latvia 4,049 were sold by twenty. The Lord richly blessed the witness, and many were the happy and interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Though there are 500 fewer brethren than when I came over, yet the average number out each week in the year is 770 for 1926-’27. In 1925-’26 it was 650, and previously it was still less. Clearly the work of the remnant can be discerned ; they are “a people for his name”, and it is their delight to vindicate it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is a joy to see how the Lord is blessing the work in the Baltic States. There literally a handful of the brethren are putting out books by the thousand in languages of which they know but the veriest smattering. In an altogether unexpected way Jehovah speaks to his own in these lands through “stammering lips, and another tongue”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We are rejoicing in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower;</span><span class="font2"> and the brethren are very appreciative of the help they receive in studies conducted by the pilgrims, while the latter also are richly blessed as they so serve and also as they head the gallant little bands going forth to the work. In all-the countries the interchange of pilgrims is much enjoyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The managers have arranged many conventions and local gatherings in the various lands; and at the drives on such occasions many brethren take part for the first time. More and more are gradually entering into the joy of the Lord in this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">So the good work goes on. At times we wonder how we can possibly surpass a previous good effort; and then we remind ourselves of the lark which, as it mounts higher and higher, trills forth its song again and again, “lest,” as the poet says, “you should think he never could recapture his first wild, careless rapture.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The brethren who came to Copenhagen were delighted to see and hear you. By unanimous consent It was voted the biggest and best convention ever held In Scandinavia. I am charged with many greetings of love to you and many requests to “come again” next year. Please come and stay the whole time then! We are glad for the continued help from Brooklyn in the matter of books, especially in Norway, Denmark and Finland. Glad also these three countries are now able to some extent to share the burden. In the Baltic States, of course, the work is wholly supported by the Head Office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In each of the abovementioned countries there are local managers; and in addition to the general report of the general manager, separate reports are made for the countries mentioned.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark228"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark229"></a>NORWAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">At the convention held at Copenhagen, Denmark, early in September, the local managers from Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and the Baltic Sea States, had the privilege of meeting together and encouraging one another. The work in Norway has progressed during the year; and a summary of the work can be gathered from the following quotation taken from the report of Brother Enok Oman, the local manager:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thank you very much for the encouraging time at Copenhagen convention. It was a great refreshment to see you and hear your loving and encouraging words to the convention. The next time you come to Europe, we will be very glad if you could stop also in Norway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We are very thankful to you for all you have done for the Lord’s work in Norway. With your help we have received a great new stock specially of booklets, and also Volume I and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Harp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Also this last year has gone very quickly; and with thanks and reverence to our heavenly Father we can see back to a very happy time in his work. With going from door to door we have had many experiences of great interest and blessing. The friends' are working with harmony and loyalty ; and we hope still more friends do see their privileges to go out in the colporteur work, as this work the Lord specially now will have done. We have not yet got the radio; but in the Lord’s right time also this will be open. We are doing what we can to get it opened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From the office we have sent out a total of 65,181 books and booklets; 217,723 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Testimonies</span><span class="font2"> and other tracts, and hand-bills; 5,060 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletins,</span><span class="font2"> and 2,614 letters. One hundred seventy friends have been out in the class colporteur work; average number of workers out each week sixty-eight. Subscriptions to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The ~Watch Tower</span><span class="font2"> have increased 309. Subscriptions to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> have decreased 279.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Two brothers have been in the pilgrim work. And also this year our dear Brother Dey has exchanged the speaking brethren from the different countries, to the great help of the friends and the work. In all, there were traveled by pilgrims 26,628 miles. One country convention we have had in Oslo, July 7 to 10, attendance 150. We have had four local conventions on different times, in Oslo, Bergen, Stavanger, and Narvik, with attendance of from fourteen to 120.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The people begin now to feel the way to Armageddon, and our opportunities to comfort them have been greater. But because of the long distances and bad traveling communications, many places have not yet been colporteured. If the Lord will open a way to get a motor boat, it will be a very good help in the work in the hundreds of fjords and islets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It will be a great joy for us to go out to the people with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom for the Peoples.</span><span class="font2"> We are now translating it. Also we will be very glad to go out with the wonderful book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance,</span><span class="font2"> when we receive it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Wonderful is the light </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">THE LORD</span><span class="font2"> is giving us in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The &quot;Watch Tower!</span><span class="font2"> We desire to act in harmony with it, and the Lord himself will help us to do it.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark230"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark231"></a>POLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The work in Poland has not progressed so much as it should have. One great difficulty and handicap to the work has been that a Polish brother competent to carry on the work as local manager has not been available. It seems that our Polish brethren who go from America soon get tired and wish to return. The brethren become discouraged, and the work does not progress. During a recent trip to Europe by the president the arrangement was made for a reorganization of the work in Poland, and the brethren are taking courage, and the work promises to be much better managed from this time forward. There is a great opportunity in Poland for some of the zealous Polish brethren who are willing to fully carry out their consecration and leave everything else behind and go into the field and earnestly work to spread the message of the kingdom. The publication of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> has been greatly hampered because of inability to get someone competent to translate it. The Polish friends have a great deal of energy, but it is not always properly directed. We have great hopes for the proper organization now in progress, that 1928, if the Lord is pleased to let us give the witness during that period, will show a great increase.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark232"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark233"></a>POBTUGAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The witnessing to the name of Jehovah and his kingdom continues in Portugal. There are 450 regular subscribers to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower;</span><span class="font3"> and when we take into consideration the conditions existing in Portugal and that it has only been a short time since the Truth was known there, the results are very gratifying. During the year there have been distributed books and booklets to the number of 3,920. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font3"> distributed in addition to the subscribers, 61,000, throughout Lisbon and suburbs. Sixty-five thousand copies of free tracts containing the London </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Testimony</span><span class="font3"> have gone out. Letters received 615; dispatched 725.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year fourteen at Lisbon have symbolized their consecration, and there are still others who have consecrated and expressed their desire to symbolize. The country, as is well known, is Catholic; and the local manager Brother Perguson says in part in his report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Although the work seems to progress very slowly in the Latin countries, it gladdens our hearts and gives us courage to know that there are still a few who are very firm and staunch. A young Portuguese who has lately become interested, was called by wire to return to Washington, where he had been seven years on seventy dollars per week; but he refused to accept the offer, saying that he prefers to receive a smaller salary and remain where he can learn more of God’s wonderful plan of salvation. There is one family who live quite a distance away, hut they come to the Bible class two times a week, and sometimes have to walk all the way. One who has lately become a subscriber from the island of Timor Dilli, sent payment for five years’ subscription in advance for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torre De Vigia.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark234"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark235"></a>ROUMANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">It is with deep regret that we report that.the work in Roumania is in a bad condition. The governing powers have made it almost impossible to work; but added to this, the local representative has not shown the proper consideration for the work. The Roumanian brethren in America are advised not to attempt to communicate with the Cluj office further, but to correspond with the Brooklyn office.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark236"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark237"></a>SOUTH AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The zeal of the brethren in South Africa continues and the witness to the Lord’s kingdom progresses. The English-speaking population is not large. The majority of the people in that land are Dutch or native Africans. The long distances between towns and the thin population make the work difficult. This in no wise, however, dampens the ardor of those who are striving to serve notice that Jehovah is God, that Christ is King, and the kingdom is at hand 1 In that land the Lord has blessed the service week especially, just as he has in other parts of the earth. The witness is being given to the praise of Jehovah’s name. The following is quoted from the report of Brother Walder, the local manager:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is once again my pleasure and privilege to submit a report of kingdom work in the South African field during the year just completed. The figures are not so large as I could wish; hut they represent the year of greatest activity and hardest work yet put forth by the brethren in this great land of few and widely scattered peoples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our total of books and booklets distributed is 54,025. Much encouragement has been received by all participating, with a growing consciousness of the Lord’s approval; this stimulates to ever greater efforts to keep the Standard of Truth flying high and to give an effective witness that the great Jehovah is indeed God and now comes into his own. Perhaps our greatest stimulus has been the positive lead and energizing Truth which we continue to receive from yourself and from Headquarters, especially through recent wonderful </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font2"> articles. Who is there among the brethren with a sincere desire to honor Jehovah but must be conscious of the Lord’s presence with his people, and that it is our King himself who now leads his army forward to certain and glorious victory? Our greatest encouragement is by reason of the fact that evidences are not wanting in this land of the effect of the witness against the Devil and his organization. This is particularly true of the country districts where the Dutch Reformed Church (much deformed) exercises tremendous power. The chief jailer has some very alert prison keepers among his subordinates, the “Predikants” (Dutch ministers). At times and in various districts these have become absolutely panicky in their efforts to frighten the workers, to intimidate their adherents and to keep back Truth from the people. In many of these districts our enemies estimate there are thousands of us; for we give them no rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By judicious moving around, the standard for the people has been raised in districts far removed from one another, the zeal of the few workers concerned and their readiness to “endure hardness as good soldiers” having made this possible. There are now no towns and but very few dorps which have not been thoroughly worked both with public lectures and colporteuring. Our total of books and booklets sold is made up as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures</span><span class="font2"> (over 1,500 sets) 11,623</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10,663</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Harp of God.</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5,461</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort for Jews, Scenarios,</span><span class="font2"> Bibles, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3,733</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Booklets &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22,544</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Total &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;54,024</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There has been considerable increase in the number of public meetings during the year and also in the number of pilgrim visits to the classes. The figures are as follows:</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark238"><span class="font2">Public Meetings (European)</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font2">Total attendance of public &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11,580</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark239"><span class="font2">Pilgrim visits to classes</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark240"><span class="font2">Attendance</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the year a special effort has been made to complete the work with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Message of Hope</span><span class="font2"> tract and to reach every home with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Testimony.</span><span class="font2"> Both these have been circulated in English and Afrikaans. Three-fourths of the work has to be done through the post. For this the friends have responded nobly, the classes, and also individual isolated brethren, making themselves responsible for given districts and also bearing the cost of postage. The following have been distributed during the year:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Testimony</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Message of Hope</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">and sundry free tracts: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;427,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Public witness handbills &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;108,250</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Slightly fewer workers have actually been in the field, but these have worked harder. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Scripture Studies</span><span class="font2"> and bound books show an increase of approximately 10,000. The colpoiteurs and class workers are handling the complete sets with success, our total of over 1500 sets sold being 600 better than for any previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Here in South Africa we are finding what also seems to be apparent in other countries, that there is no increase in the “remnant”. Our full-time colporteurs have been reduced to three, due to trying conditions in the field and the difficulty in making expenses. The weekly average of field workers from the classes is about 40. Until Service Week just completed, the greatest number of workers out during any one week was 78. About fourteen classes make regular reports, together with several brethren who are isolated but zealous in the field. Our only bi-lingual pilgrim and lecturer has been almost continuously engaged in public work, chiefly in the northern Cape Colony and Orange Free State. He has manifested much zeal and also courage in face of what sometimes amounts to violent opposition from Satan’s emissaries. During the year two English-speaking brothers have been engaged in public witnessing and colporteuring right through the province of Natal. The work has been continuous and strenuous, but the Lord has richly blessed the effort, and on the whole the witness seems to have been appreciated by the people. Brother Phillips and myself have covered many thousands of miles on pilgrim and public witnessing tours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A special word of appreciation is due to the three fulltime colporteurs, two of whom are sisters. For many months at a stretch they have worked in districts far removed from classes or brethren, often subject to extreme conditions of heat and drought. Much of the country has been experiencing the most severe drought on record, some districts having been without rain for nearly two years. Farms are forsaken, and distress and poverty are very manifest. This has made work even more difficult. The modem “Jezebel” has frequently endeavored to put them to flight but theirs is the Elisha spirit and in order that the “prisoners” might hear the message of hope and deliverance these noble brethren have gladly suffered hardship and trial. In every place visited they have succeeded in piling up the “hailstones” and we know these will yet do their work in helping to “sweep away the refuge of lies”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Service Work: South Africa’s share in the recently concluded special world week of service has proved the happiest and busiest week in kingdom services yet experienced. Sunday canvassing or selling is not permitted, and the law is rigidly enforced; so we took an extra Saturday into our week to compensate. The 120 workers in the field represent the greatest number by far that have ever been out at one time. A total of 5,523 books and booklets were sold, including 115 complete sets of nine. This is more than double last year’s total. The week has brought much encouragement to all. Even though workers and sales were few as compared to some other countries, it nevertheless gave much joy to realize that for every worker in the field here there would he thousands out at the same time in other parts of the earth and every sale would be multiplied by thousands also. The Devil must be pretty busy trying to effect repairs though he is not likely to get much time for anything of that kind from now on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Broadcasting: I am glad to report that,arrangements have now been completed with the recently formed African Broadcasting Co., to broadcast one lecture per month. They operate three stations in the three principal towns; and we have the option of using either of these as may be convenient. Our first lecture will be given 'from Cape Town on Sunday evening next. Certain restrictions have been imposed, making it difficult for us to say all that we would like to say; but we are confident the Lord will bless the effort, now that the door has been opened and that the witness will by this means reach a much wider circle than ever before. We are having to pay for the privilege; but the cost is not nearly so much as we spend on a hall and advertising, with a certainty of a larger audience than we have ever yet reached by one lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It has been a great encouragement to us here as we have read the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Messenger</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> reports of the Toronto convention, showing how the Lord made the opportunity for a world-wide broadcast to just fall into Brother Rutherford’s lap. This surely beats anything yet in the way of remarkable victories for Truth. Unfortunately nothing was heard in South Africa. The report is grand; and we now look forward to a share in getting Toronto’s message into the homes of the people. Undoubtedly it is going to do much toward diverting the “Euphrates” waters. It is helpful to be lifted by these reports to a clearer and wider vision and to watch the oncoming flood of truth, the advance streams of which have already reached our land and must soon overflow the hiding places of the biggest frauds that history has ever produced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our small printing press has continued to do good work and to save us much money. In office stationery, handbills and special tracts it has delivered nearly 300,000 pieces during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In closing this report I would again assure you, dear Brother Rutherford, of my fervent Christian love and of my continued devotion to the Lord and to his cause. Brother Phillips joins with me in this. Whilst thanking the Lord with grateful hearts for the many privileges we have enjoyed during the year and for blessings received, we continue to esteem the honor that is ours in being numbered among his witnesses; and we are determined that each day we will seek to do with our might what our hands find to do in giving a still more effective witness during the year just commenced.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark241"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark242"></a>SPAIN'</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The work for Spain is conducted from a branch maintained by the Society in Madrid. Another branch is located at Barcelona, where the witness is carried on. It is exceedingly difficult to make great progress with the witness of the Truth in Spain because of opposition from the Papal system. Truly in that land the poor people are prisoners; but the Lord hears their cry, as he promised, and in due time will break their shackles and set them free. In the meantime his will as expressed in his Word is that a witness must be given to his name. An effort is being put forth to that end, and his blessing has been added. Taking into consideration the poverty of the people and the great opposition, the results of the work in Spain during the fiscal year are encouraging:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">There are 7,647 copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La Torre del Vigia</span><span class="font2"> on order monthly for foreign distribution. That is 497 more than last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Subscribers to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La Torre del Vigia-</span><span class="font2"> in Spain 1111</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">In spite of 250 subscribers having discontinued abroad and 216 in Spain, there is a total of 762 subscribers more this year than last, as the discontinued subscribers were mostly those of last year, new ones made in this year have a total of 1,198.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The brethren will be interested in the following words taken from the report of our brother who is in charge at Madrid:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is an undeniable fact that if in this country there existed the religious liberty which exists in other lands from many years back the results of the kingdom message in Spain and her colonies would be far more satisfactory; but in a country where the organized social, political, commercial and industrial life is completely dominated by the clergy, who are the owners and lords of the largest industries and companies, as also of all educational means, owners of all means of national power, influencing millions of individuals whose interests are wrapped up in the government, the relative progress which the work has made during the past year, is nothing short of a miracle which God manifests to his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many people subscribed to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La Torre del Vigia,</span><span class="font2"> but soon discontinued through the influence of the Catholic and Protestant clergy, through the fear of losing their work and means of livelihood and of being ignored by their friends and families who live united to the commercial religion. There are others who never can receive their </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower </span><span class="font2">or other literature unless it is sent by registered mail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After the first year, when the work could be carried on with more liberty because it had not become known, and the adversaries were not forewarned, strong opposition gradually increased and used every possible means to hinder the witness, but still cannot stop it. In October of 1926, 22,000 copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La Torre del Vigia</span><span class="font2"> were distributed in Valencia, with good results; much to the alarm of the clergy who pronounced us as being Masons and agents of the Black Hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In November 6,000 copies were distributed in Tarragona, the city where the Apostle Paul preached. There persecution reached a climax. From the Catholic schools they sent young boys who by underhanded means asked for and obtained the papers that had been distributed by the colporteur. These were taken to a convent yard, and there burned in the presence of the chief priests, the city making a holiday of the occasion. Neverthleless many of the citizens were very indignant when they knew the facts. The civil authorities were very liberal to the message, and a great number subscribed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In December and January the public distribution of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font2"> in Barcelona was prohibited, and permission was refused for the opening of a meeting place after it was all painted and prepared by two of the brethren. This was done through the influence of the bishop, who rules the city. Nevertheless before this, over 80,000 were distributed in the shops and houses and a number of books sold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the present time Brother Saturnino Fernandez, who is working there as colporteur for the Society, holds a class meeting every night of the week in some friend’s house, where an average of ten people meet, making a total of from seventy to eighty interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the year mostly through correspondence various classes have been formed in the following cities: Vigo, Santander, Huesca, Elche, and Coruna. Shortly Brother Corzo hopes to visit them personally and baptize many who desire to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In spite of oppositions and difficulties the subscribers to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La Torre del Vigia</span><span class="font2"> gradually increase. During the year 1198 have subscribed; and though 466 have discontinued in Spain and abroad, there are still 762 subscribers more than last year. The total is 2588.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In May a doctor subscribed and immediately commenced to procure subscribers in his city and surrounding villages with great enthusiasm. At once the clergy, full of ire, had him arrested and accused him of selling poisonous books at the same time that he is employed as an official -doctor by the government. However, as his life and conduct is known by the authorities and all the-village to be unimpeachable, he was set free and now continues to proclaim the message with great vigor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another brother in the city of Toro was dismissed from his position in a chemist shop, for causing division amongst his family by having distributed </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La Torre del Vigia;</span><span class="font2"> and as in the famous Inquisition he was taken before a council of priests and had to hear three sermons. He was counselled to leave his heresies, or he would be excommunicated. By what he had already read of the literature he was able to stand his ground and give good answers, for which the clergy pronounced him mad and forthwith excommunicated him. This brother is obliged to leave this city, where the religion predominates as in the Twelfth Century; and all doors are shut to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Madrid there have been a good many classes; five are held now. At some studies held in Tetuan de las Victorias, there was an attendance of from forty to seventy interested, but many left off attending because of the long distances. Now, with the new office in a more central part of the town, we hope the attendance will be more regular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The work of correspondence, mailing of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower, </span><span class="font2">holding classes, and translations is carried on by two brothers and one sister, who work in the office in Madrid, and in Barcelona by Brother Fernandez. In other provinces there are four voluntary colporteurs who, after their toil, sell a few books and help to secure subscribers, besides attending to the classes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The many restrictions of the law respecting religious literature and the opposition of the clergy constantly hampers the work, and the prevailing poverty of the land makes book selling a difficult business. Our prayer is that God may open the door in his own good time and way so that his message may resound from end to end of every land.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark257"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark258"></a>SWEDEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">It is with gratitude to the Lord that we have watched the progress of the work in Sweden during the year. The organization has been strengthened, the members thereof encouraged, and they have gone on gladly with the work. They have placed in the hands of the people during the year of books and booklets a total number of 180,741. In addition thereto they have distributed free literature to the number of 388,000 copies. There are eighty-eight classes, seventy-one of which are organized for service work. In addition thereto there are isolated service workers to the number of seventy-one. The total engaged in the service work is 535. The average number of workers each week is 233, including the colporteurs. During the year three have been regularly engaged in the pilgrim service. Meetings for the interested 878, attendance 13,087; meetings for the public 408, attendance 32,094. Twenty-two have engaged regularly in the colporteur service, and twenty in the auxiliary colporteur service. Handbills with the message on the opposite side have been distributed to the number of 72,450. The local manager in making his report says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The year has been one of greater activity, as was to be expected; and the move to Stockholm as the center of the work has had its part in achieving this, thus proving the Lord’s approval of this move. The two conventions held in this town during the year were highly appreciated by the friends, practically all of whom enthusiastically took part in the work of witnessing to this town. The results were very gratifying, the summer convention giving a sale of twenty-six books per worker on Service Day. In the country as a whole, we have had nineteen conventions, attended by 1,123 friends, who have taken part in the service everywhere with great joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Not only at conventions but throughout the year the friends have seen and made use of their privileges of service in a greater measure than last year. The number of service workers taking part has been 233 each week upon an average, including colporteurs and auxiliaries. This increase in the number of workers, as well as the better organization and training, have helped to raise the number of books put out. The grand total put out from the Office is 180,741 books and booklets, which is practically fifty percent increase from last year. The reports from classes and colporteurs show that more than five-sixths of these books have been put into the hands of the people by actual sales. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font2"> book has proven a very rapid seller, and we are now eagerly awaiting the second edition, For the coming year we expect great help in placing the books from the motor car you promised us when at Copenhagen. It will be a joy to be able to reach those faraway villages in the deep forests. The I. B. S. A. Week feature of the work was a great stimulus to the friends, if possible still more so than last year. Practically the same number of workers were out during that week as last year, but the sales were more than fifty percent up. The workers received a more friendly reception this year, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As to the pilgrim service, the experience has been to the effect that two-day appointments are very much needed and appreciated. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font2"> studies at pilgrim visits are almost indispensable; and service as a fixed item is very helpful, not only to the friends but to the pilgrims also. At some points the friends have arranged for service at one-day appointments, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden, Age</span><span class="font2"> work shows a slight decrease in the number of subscribers, owing to the uncertainty as to its continuance which prevailed at the beginning of the year and held this work back a little bit. For this year, however, we plan to make a big drive during December and at New Year’s season, when most people in Sweden renew their subscriptions and take new magazines for the coming calendar year. We receive many testimonies showing the good work this journal does among the people, sweetening their minds and preparing them more and more to see things from the Bible viewpoint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The radio we have been unable to use during the year; but we are going to try at it again, if fortunately we may get in. The success of Copenhagen in this respect at your visit has given us fresh appetite and courage as to the radio question. And in the Lord’s due time the message will go out over the radio also in Sweden. It would, of course, be a great help to achieve this if we could have a visit from you, dear Brother Rutherford; and whether we get in over the radio before you come to Europe next time or not, we hope to have the privilege of a visit from you then.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At this season I also want to take the opportunity to express our gratitude for the help and blessing continually received throughout the year from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font2"> and its illuminating articles giving us the ever brighter light upon our Father’s Word, and thus showing us his wonderful love and provisions for those who love him supremely and inciting to still more joyful service. We want to show our gratitude by doing our best to look after the kingdom interests entrusted to us, and doing so in harmony with the Lord’s channel, the Society.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark259"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark260"></a>SWITZERLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The Society’s office in Berne, Switzerland, under the local management of Brother Harbeck, attends to the kingdom interests of the Lord in Switzerland, Holland, Belgium and France. This is known as the Central European Office. The witness work in this part of the field is in far better condition than it was in 1926. There is still much to be done; but it is heart cheering to see how the zealous ones are pressing on with the work that must be done. From Brother Harbeck’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Switzerland shows an increase above the activity of last year, even though the number of class workers is a little less. A few of the fanatical ones who were driven by Brother Weber into a fanatical service have left the ranks, but in spite of this more actual work lias been done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the past many colporteurs and class workers were persecuted by police and the excited clergy; but now, we have taken up a few cases with the courts, and a greater freedom for our workers has been the result. The people are more receptive, and they begin to see -who their real friends are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Recently during a service drive one brother of the Bethel home entered a priest’s home. When the priest learned that the entire village had been canvassed, he became so enraged that he went to the house and came back with a revolver, threatening the brother. The brother was not at all fearful, but remarked later that he was sorry that he did not have his camera handy so that he could have taken a picture of this son of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Service Week was a glorious success for the Lord; for 760 workers in Switzerland distributed 34,450 books and booklets, which is just double the amount distributed last year during Service Week. Twenty-five brethren of the Bethel home having a part in this work distributed more than 3,000 books and booklets during this special effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Of course, we find that not all the class members realize their great privileges of service. For instance: At Basel, which is the largest class in Switzerland, only about one-third or about 100 go out regularly on service days. Biel, a smaller class of about fifty-two, reports thirty-five regular and zealous workers. Berne comes next on the honor roll. During Service Week Berne placed 6,000 books and booklets, a smaller class of about fifty-two, reports thirty-five regularly in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The friends here were surely encouraged by your recent visit, and the Zurich Convention proved to be a special source of blessing and a stimulus to greater activity. Personally I also appreciated your visit very much and considered it a great favor to have a part in holding up my little end of the load upon you. My fellowship with you, Brother Rutherford, has always been sweet and happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There has been interest manifested by a number of Jews in Switzerland. Basle was the place of the first Zionist convention. It was also the place of the Zionist convention for 1927. While not a great many Jews have shown an interest in the Truth, we are pleased to say that some manifest faith to a degree in the Lord’s Word.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark261"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark262"></a>TEINIDAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The interest in the Lord’s message continues in the little island of Trinidad. A comparison with last year shows a slight increase. During the year 2778 class meetings have been held, with a total attendance of 38,186; 38 public meetings, with an attendance of 4,268; books placed in the hands of the people, 7,472, booklets 5,725, or a total of 13,197 as compared with 6,624 of last year. Prom the local manager’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Regarding the work in this territory during the past year, it is my pleasure to report that there were sent out from the office more than double the quantity of books sent during the previous year; also that the brethren are manifesting the Elisha spirit, some evidence of it being that they visited with the kingdom message upwards of 7,000 homes during Service Week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The wonderful and sublime thoughts coming through </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font2"> are certainly channels of strength and encouragement, for which we are very grateful and cannot thank too much our Lord and King, as well as the brethren whom he is using.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark263"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark264"></a>YEAR TEXT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Sing forth the honor of his name.”—Psalm 66: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH’S name is presented for our consideration during the ensuing year. His name bears the closest relationship to his works. The name God signifies that he is the great Creator of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to all. The name Jehovah signifies his purpose toward his creation. The name Almighty signifies and is a guarantee that he possesses the ability to carry out all his purposes and that he will do so. His name Most High signifies his supremacy above all and that he is the Author, Executor, and Finisher of his plan. Each of his names bespeaks his glory, honor, and majesty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The creature’s highest attainment is to live for ever in a state of happiness. Jehovah God alone can grant this great prize. The new creation is the most blessed of his creatures. Christ Jesus is the Head thereof and as the Father’s High Priest authoritatively gives promise to the body members that faithfulness unto death guarantees to them the crown of life. These must with patient continuance in well doing seek that prize.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Knowledge of God and his purpose is essential to those who would live. “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.”—John 17: 3.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark265"></a><span class="font3">It is the will of God that all men shall be brought to a knowledge of the truth. That means that all must have an opportunity to know God, which of necessity involves knowing the name of the Almighty One. God has provided the means for all his creatures to know his boly name. To this end he has devoted much time to gathering out from amongst men a people for his name. Such constitute a people selected for a purpose. The selection of that people is about completed. Their work is just beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is written: “I will bow down towards thy holy temple and thank thy name for thy loving kindness and for thy faithfulness, for thou hast magnified above all thy name thy promise.”—Psalm 138: 2, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Botherham, Leeser.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Long centuries ago God made promise that he would select a “seed”, that he would establish a new heaven and new earth, and that through the selected “seed” and the ministration of his kingdom on earth all the families of earth shall have an opportunity for the blessings of life. During all these centuries he has magnified his promise above his name. He has moved forward exactly in harmony with his plan to make good his promise. Only from time to time he has seen it necessary for the benefit of men to put his name before them. Now the crucial hour has arrived when Jehovah will make a name for himself before all his creatures. Those called and selected as a people for his name must now bear witness in the earth that Jehovah is God. They must sing forth the honor of his name because it is his will that such be done. A better knowledge of his name is essential to them now, hence the importance of the year text study. With a clearer vision of his purpose these now exclaim: “Thou hast magnified thy promise above all thy name. Now we shall delight to sing forth the honor of thy name.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In declaring the honor of God’s name the f aithful will meet with opposition. It is the cup poured for them and to them it is the cup of salvation. Each one of the faithful must partake thereof, therefore each one will call upon the name of the Lord and he will render the needed protection and help. He is the Father of these</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and loves his children. He has promised to keep them in the hollow of his hand. He always makes good his promise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All who live must come to a knowledge of God’s plan. The day will come when the knowledge of the glory and honor of God’s holy name will fill the whole earth as </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">waters now fill the deep. His faithful ones, called out of darkness into the light that is now marvelously shining, will have to do with disseminating that knowledge to the peoples of earth. Wonderful and blessed is that privilege! The study of the text during the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">year will </span><span class="font3">help the called and chosen ones to be faithful.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I the Lord, the first, and with the last; I am he. —Isaiah 41: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah is and always was. From everlasting to everlasting he is the Lord God. He himself testifies, saying: “Before me there was no God formed, neither shall there </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font3">after me.” (Isaiah 43:10) He is the first, being before all created things. How unsearchable to us are the thoughts which he must have had as he communed with himself when he was all alone in the immeasurable eternity of time and space! He is the Great Character. What he was then he is today and for ever shall be; he changes not. He is the God who is love, and was such with the first of his creations, who was the Logos. He will be the same loving God with the last of the new creation. Were it possible to think of God’s ever ceasing from his work of creation, he would be found with the very last creation to be the same, namely, love divine.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The beginning of the creation of God—the firstborn of every creature.—Revelation 3:14; Colossians 1:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Before the beginning of creation Jehovah was alone. Then it dehghted him to bring into existence the Logos, his beloved Son. The beginning of God’s creation has always been and ever will be his greatest joy. One of the titles of the Logos is “The Bright and Morning Star”. He is always resplendently shedding forth the glory of his Father. He has always occupied a confidential relationship to Jehovah. He was entrusted with the great work of the redemption of man. Under the most crucial test he proved the most complete devotion to his Father and was given the title “Faithful and True”. He was made the mighty Priest unto God, which was foreshadowed by Melchizedek, and is henceforth and for ever the great Executive Officer of Jehovah. He occupies </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">highest position next to his Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">January 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God . . . created dll things by Jesus Ghrist.—Eph. 3: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s first and only direct creation was the Logos, who later on became the man Christ Jesus. As the active agent of the great Creator, the Logos proceeded with the creation of all things that were thereafter created. In due order came the creation of the beautiful spirit creatures, such as the cherubim, the seraphim, and the host of angels, each of whom was assigned to his respective duty. Among these created ones was Lucifer, who was originally a part of the holy organization of God. He, as one of the works of Jehovah, was perfect in all his appointments and ways, and thus he continued until lawlessness found place in him. The time came eventually for material works of creation to appear, and innumerable planets were made, and the sun and moon and stars. Then came the time for creating man’s habitation. “Without him [the Logos] was not anything made that was made.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">January 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD.—Deuteronomy 28:58.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah indicates his purpose towards his people by that name. While the Israelites were in Egypt he revealed himself to them by his name, declaring his purpose to deliver them and to be their Lord for ever. At the organization of their government he said: “I am Jehovah thy God.” These two names bespeak his person, his purpose and his glorious power. This revelation is for the benefit of his people and calls for obedience to his commands. Further revelation to his people brings to them privileges and responsibilities. In these latter days God has more clearly revealed to his people his purpose to deliver his church, overthrow the enemy’s organization, deliver the people therefrom, and establish a righteous government for man on earth. He commands his people to give notice to the rulers and peoples of earth of his purpose concerning them. All who love him will proclaim the glory of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. —Genesis 1:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah testifies to his being the Author of creation, saying, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font3"> have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.” Before him we bow in profound reverence and in recognition of him as the great Birst Cause. We worship him as the true God, the Designer and Builder of all things, and especially as the Creator of that which our senses discern; namely, the earth and the visible heavens whose beauties and glories delight us by day and by night. Such reverence of God tends to our gaining eternal life. (Prov. 19: 23) It is the beginning of godly wisdom, whereby we are able to enjoy and view properly the manifold works of Jehovah and to benefit by the earnest consideration of them. In wisdom Jehovah made all his works, and we may draw wisdom from the study of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">January 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.—Genesis 1:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah, undoubtedly conversing with his loyal Son, the Logos, said: “Let </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">us</span><span class="font3"> make man.” Accordingly the Father furnished the plans and specifications for building the first man, even to the numbering of the hairs necessary to make a perfect creature; and the Logos carried out the plans to the letter, and has been interested in man’s welfare from that time to this. What a thrilling moment it must have been for him when that perfect thing, the result of his exquisite workmanship, first breathed, and opened his eyes, and began the exercise of those powers which made him once and will make him again the ruler of all the earth, the earthly likeness of the Creator! Jehovah was pleased at how the Logos had faithfully used the power delegated to him and pronounced the creature, man, very good. He loved this earthly son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Who covereih the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains. He giveth to the least his food, and to the young ravens which cry.—Psalm 147: 8, 9. </span><span class="font3">The holy prophet marked God’s providences as they embraced even the lower creatures of earth, and was moved to sing the praises of Jehovah therefor. Should we not do the same? Jesus did so. Hearken to his words: “Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing ? And one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.” Listen to God’s own words to Job: “Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.” Jehovah provideth meat for the ravens, even though they were designated as unclean for Jewish food. Truly God’s love is broad; and we cannot but be benefited by consideration of his loving provision for every living creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">January 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden. — Gen. 2: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah was Adam’s Benefactor and Friend. Before creating him, Jehovah, like a faithful parent, looked out for his happiness and provided a paradise of pleasure to be his home. Jehovah was not merely interested in planting attractive-looking trees and trees bearing fruit good for man’s daily food; he was also interested in having man live for ever to delight himself in the Lord and to glorify him on earth. So he made the tree of life to grow in the midst of the garden. He intended that Adam, when tested and proved worthy of eternal life, should partake of it and thereby have God’s guarantee that he should revel in the fulness of life for ever. In due time every intelligent creature will have an opportunity, under full and fair conditions, to follow Jehovah’s righteous commands and receive the reward of being permitted to partake of the tree of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who ridefh upon the heavens in thy help, and in his excellency</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">on the sky.—To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Deut. 33: 26; Psa. 68: 63.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Heaven is defined as that which is lofty and high, that which is looked up to. To men the things of heaven are invisible. The invisible powers of heaven are exercised over men, influencing and controlling them. The upright man, made so by reason of being in Christ Jesus, is controlled by the Lord God. There are degrees or ranks in the heavenly organization which is in harmony with Jehovah, but Jehovah God is above all, and all of his organization supports him and bears, him up. Hence he rides above the organization or above the heavens. He is the God of the heavens, the invisible organization of all righteous creatures; and he is the God of Jeshurun, the righteous ones of earth. He rides on his heavenly organization to help them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">January 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.—Psalm 105:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Written aforetime for the comfort of the feet members of Christ, this Psalm is evidence to them that the time has come to have Jehovah’s name made known to the peoples of the earth. Jehovah glories in their confidence in him. His servants glory in all they know of him. They need strength which he alone can provide. That which the Lord is now doing in the earth proves to the Servant class that now is the time for the fulfilment of this prophecy. Therefore they call upon each other to glory in his holy name. It becomes the duty and privilege of each one of the saints to encourage his brethren to seek the Lord and have some part in his service. All the kingdom interests on earth are now committed to the faithful Servant class, as Jesus declared they would be; and these seek-earnestly the face of the Lord that they may know what he would have them do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I am Jehovah, that is my name; and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise unto graven images.—Isaiah 42:8, A. R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah was the Savior of Israel. He is the Savior of all who will be saved. He has permitted evil for a time. It is not his will that evil shall prevail. He will not permit men, angels or Satan to work out salvation for man. Satan has posed as the Savior of the world. His schemes of reform so-called offered through his agencies in the name of the Lord must fail. Jehovah alone saves. He will not give his glory to others. Men have made “graven images”, which are called religious institutions, and the claim is made that salvation comes through these “graven images”. God will destroy the “graven images”, proving that they are false systems and that their creator and operators are false gods. With blindness removed the people will see that Jehovah is the Savior of man and give his name the glory. This message must now be given to the nations as a witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">January 12</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you?—1 Corinthians 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Each one who is a member of the body of Christ and who abides in the temple class, is the dwelling place of God’s holy spirit. Though a new creature his organism is still the body of flesh, and the natural tendency of his flesh will be earthly. If he lets his mind be governed by such tendency, it will search out and meditate upon facts and things pertaining to gratifying the flesh. Those who follow this tendency are not walking after the spirit, but are in danger of defiling the temple of God and suffering destruction from the Lord. Since Jehovah dwells in us by his spirit, let us not be carnally-minded. Let us bear in mind that the spirit of God dwells in us for a purpose; not as a mere hallowing influence that removes us from the realm of the profane and secular things, but as a power to enliven us and move us to do that which Jehovah’s Word reveals to be his will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh.—Romans 8:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The law of God is good. It is perfect. The spirit of it is love; “the end of the commandment is love out of a pure heart.” But even though we have the spirit of that law in our hearts, yet our flesh is weak as respects keeping that law perfectly. In our flesh dwells no good thing, so that we cannot do the things that we would. Consequently the law, delivered to the Jews, could not of itself perfect the Jews in righteousness because the law of sin and death operated in their flesh; their attempts to keep the law could not make them worthy of justification in God’s sight. But happily what the law could not do under present conditions, Jehovah did. He sent his righteous Son to die, and thus provided for the imputation of righteousness to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">January 14</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved.—Psalm 99:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Represented by his Messenger, who came to his temple in 1918, Jehovah is now seated in glory amidst the cherubim. The Revelator John caught a vision of Jehovah upon his throne and round about him four beasts, symbolically representing wisdom, justice, love and power. Prior to this time it has been made to appear that God is unjust, because so much unrighteousness is practised amongst men, who say that God is responsible for it. It has been represented that God’s power is insufficient to restrain evil; that he is not wise enough to establish a different condition; and that he is not a God of love, otherwise he would not permit so much suffering. Now the time has come for the four divine attributes of Jehovah to be expressed plainly. Zion, his organization, is the agency being used to publish these attributes of his as working in harmony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God . . . hath also given unto us his holy spirit. —1 Thessalonians 1:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The fruit of God’s spirit is love, because God is love. His disposition is to do good unto all. Everything that our Father and our Lord do is prompted by love. When begotten and anointed of the holy spirit, we receive the spirit of the Lord; hence we receive the spirit as a gift from him. “As he is, so are we in this world.” “He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God.” As we come in contact with those of the world and present to them the gospel of the kingdom, we may be rebuffed, spurned, ill-treated, slandered, and abused. But, remembering that we have received from God his spirit, we should pity those who persecute us. We should watch for opportunities to do them good, especially to present unto them the balm of God’s message when trouble breaks their spirit and makes them needy of God’s comfort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">January 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">For the word of the Lord is right; and all his works are done in truth.—Psalm 33:</span><span class="font3">4</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The works of Jehovah are not like those of Satan, works of hypocrisy, sham, imitation or counterfeiting. They are true works, able to bear the most searching investigation. Hence they have his approval. The Bible, written by holy men of old who were inspired by his spirit, is his Word; and hence it is right and true and will abide for ever. God has manifested his works and his dealings unto his church in recent years. These are not deceptive nor imaginary works, as those who go out from us would like to make us believe. They are true works of Jehovah, unerring in the glorious objective toward which they are working. It is because of this that these works have successfully withstood the combined assaults of all the forces of darkness and untruth. They shall continue to stand through the shaking period now on; for they are true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">January 17</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? — Romans 8:32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In. his unbounded love Jehovah did not shrink from delivering up his own Son, his firstborn and only-begotten One, to die for the sinner race. Could any gift transcend this gift in behalf of man? No, for in it was wrapped up everything for which either church or mankind could hope of life and happiness. It was Jehovah’s supreme sacrifice. Hence all gifts that he might bestow thereafter could not but be less in value in the affections of Jehovah than this gift of his precious Son. Out of this great gift all other gifts to us grow, and thus “to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, . . . and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him”. What an assurance this gives that “no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly” until the kingdom is surely gained I</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">January 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">As for our redeemer, the Lord of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel.—Isaiah</span><span class="font3"> 47</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The name “Jehovah of hosts” is always associated with the kingdom, whether the symbolic or the real is considered. In delivering Israel he brought into action his forces; Now the time is at hand when he will deliver his chosen people and those of mankind who desire righteousness. For the accomplishment of his purpose he gathers all his forces together. He reveals himself to his people as “Jehovah of hosts”, and by faith they see him leading his hosts to complete victory. Not only does he give to his chosen people his exceeding great and precious promises, but he calls them into his army and makes them a part of his host. The part now to be performed by the members of the host on earth, his anointed ones, is to sing forth the praises and honor of his holy name by declaring his majesty, his purpose, his love and his power. Others of his mighty host will perform the work of destroying the enemy’s forces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">January 19</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Behold my servant, whom I uphold, mine elect,- in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">upon him.—Isaiah 42:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Servant whom Jehovah stays up, and in whom he delights as his elect or chosen one, seems clearly to be composed of those who are devoted to the Lord Jehovah and are faithfully serving him. Of this class Christ Jesus is the Head. He was always faithful in his service and is designated The Faithful and True. Upon him Jehovah put his spirit that he might do the Father's will. Upon those who are in Christ Jesus this same holy spirit has come through the Head, Christ Jesus. Without question these must be serving the purposes of Jehovah as opportunity affords. To them Jehovah announces their present form of service, saying, “Ye are my witnesses.” Whereas Satan is employing all his power to discredit God, it is the privilege of the Servant class to testify to God’s goodness and greatness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">January 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love. — Ephesians 1:</span><span class="font3">4</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah chose the Logos as the great Melchizedek Priest to execute his purposes and also chose to associate a company of saints with him in the great work. Jehovah made this choice before ever Satan had founded his wicked world organization. And what was Jehovah’s conception of these saints in Christ Jesus away back there? It was of a class distinguished because of holiness unto the Lord, not divided in their allegiance to the cause of righteousness, not fractional in their devotion to Jehovah, but fully dedicated to God’s will and purposes mot for a day or to any fixed date but for ever. Their heart condition, as Jehovah foresaw it, would be blameless in love; they would hold him uppermost in their affections and be sincere and genuine in their expression of unselfishness. To such Jehovah will give the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">hath made him to be  sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might he made the righteousness of God in him.—2 Corinthians 5:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What a Tare and inimitable exhibition of love by Jehovah! Jesus his Son had never tasted sin or been defiled with it, and yet Jehovah’s love prompted him to make that Holy One as it were the personification of sin in order that sin might no longer be imputed to man. It is true that the ransom feature of God’s plan made it necessary that Jesus die in taking the sinner’s place; but still, to what unscalable heights Jehovah’s love must have risen for our sakes to be willing even to impute sin to one so pure and innocent and loyal as his faithful Son Jesus. How gratifying, though, the results must be to Jehovah now! For his Son proved true even to the death of the cross; and we, who have been washed in his blood from all sin, now appear unto Jehovah as the embodiment of righteousness in Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">January 22</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge.—Psalm 94:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The present conflict is the greatest war of the ages. This is the time when the enemy is assaulting Jehovah’s faithful representatives on earth. The Nation has been born; and the Dragon, namely, the Devil and his organization, makes war against those who observe the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. “They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous.” (V. 21) The only righteous ones are those who are in Christ, and their righteousness is by virtue of being in Christ. They need not fear in the present crisis. Jehovah is the defensive Rock of their refuge. Abiding in the shadow of this great Rock, they abide in the secret place of the Most High; and, knowing their security in him, they may boldly continue singing forth his praises, letting even the enemies hear their voices for a testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">There are diversities of operations; hut it is the same God which worketh all in all.—1 Corinthians 12:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It should ever be borne in mind that the church is Jehovah’s organization and that he is supervising its operations, because it is devoted to him. He is the One who is really doing the work, and hence all credit and praise should go to him. He pours out the one spirit upon the whole church that it may be one with him and with Christ Jesus, the Head, and that the members thereof may be one with themselves. There necessarily will be differences of operation of God’s spirit, or power, with different members of the church according as their appointed tasks and duties may differ. Nevertheless, a brother should not become discouraged if he sees another brother in a prominent service accomplishing what appears to be much, while he himself is engaged in a minor service not bringing such noticeable results. Why not? Because he possesses the same spirit; and the same God is using him as well as his more prominent brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">January 24</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God giveth not the spirit by measure unto him. The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.—John 3:34, 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah committed to Jesus all his interests. Surely Jesus possessed the greatest ability of any one ever on earth. His ability did not consist of physical strength and a collegiate education; for he did not use his physical strength particularly, nor did he ever attend a theological school. Of what, then, did the ability of Jesus consist? His absolute, complete devotion to the Father’s will, his complete loyalty to Jehovah. This finds expression in his words: “Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, 0 my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.” His capacity was complete; therefore Jehovah filled him with his spirit in the complete sense, and he proved his loyalty to Jehovah to the utmost. Let us be conformed unto Jesus’ image by Jehovah’s spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">January </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">25</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">And the Lord shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one Lord, and his name one.—Zechariah 14: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As used in this text, “in that day” means a time when God’s name shall be magnified in the minds of all his obedient creation. AU such will gladly acknowledge him as the only true God. Today there are many lords and many gods. “In that day” all who oppose righteousness will be destroyed. All praise and honor then will be bestowed upon Jehovah, and his name will be made glorious in the minds of men. The name, person, power and glory of Jehovah will be exalted to its rightful place among all creation. All men will then come to know that Jehovah, the God of Israel, is the great Ruler over all the earth; and that he is ruling through his beloved Christ, the King. The people will recognize that Jehovah is the Creator of all things and will worship his name. Now he commands his people on earth to begin the glad song because “the day of the Lord is at hand”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">January 26</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.—Isa. 55: 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus testified of his own mission in coming to earth and in appearing publicly in the midst of Satan’s world: “To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I. should bear witness unto the truth.” (John 18:37) Whatsoever Jesus had seen and heard of the Father, that he testified. (John 3:32) Consequently Jehovah could give him as one who can lead the people into truth and who can command them in the ways of the Lord. As Jehovah used Moses as his witness before Pharaoh and Egypt and then used him in leading Israel out of Egypt and in commanding them all the words of the Lord, so the Lord will use the Christ, the Prophet like unto Moses. Could Jehovah state and illustrate his commission to us more plainly? Surely our privileged part at present is to witness to the people and to go through the gates and thus lead them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings.—Revelation 11:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The temple of Jehovah God is made up of the living members who are saints and whom the Lord finds to be faithful when he comes to take an account with them. In 1914 Jehovah’s Vicegerent Jesus began to reign, and thereafter at the beginning of 1918 the facts show that a great trial came upon all the true church throughout the earth. That marked the time when Jehovah opened his temple in heaven; and now the enlightened eyes of the faithful behold the &quot;Messenger of the Covenant”, or testament, enthroned in glory in the temple. Intermittent flashes of light on God’s truth, like lightnings, accompany and follow this notable event. As the flashes of light have come to the temple class since 1918, they have appreciated the greater illumination of their understanding and have rejoiced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">January 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">It came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money.—Luke 19:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In 1914 Jehovah gave the kingdom of earth to his noble Son, Jesus. The new King has servants in the earth; and to these he has committed the interests of his kingdom, represented in the parable by the money or pounds. This Servant class has undertaken to look after his interests in the earth. The Lord furnishes them with opportunities faithfully to represent him; namely, to advertise the King and the kingdom of which they are ambassadors. By utilizing these opportunities, so manifold and numerous today, the servants give evidence of their faithfulness to the Lord. Those who will shine the brightest in the kingdom will not be the ones who hold the most prominent positions on this side the va.il, necessarily. It is faithfulness that warrants tire Lord in advancing anyone to a position in the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Moreover, the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lord bindeth up the breach of his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Isaiah 30: 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This is the day in which Jehovah is binding up the hurt of his people, and hence they now dwell in Zion, and their eyes see their teachers. In times past Christians have had some difficulty in determining what is Jehovah’s will concerning them. Now they can see his will, as symbolized by the moon, more clearly than ever before. They know it is God’s will that they should have boldness now in proclaiming the message of the kingdom. The light of that kingdom is symbolized by the sun. The Sun of righteousness is arising; and the light of God is shining round his organization, Zion, and particularly upon the Head thereof. This increased light the Lord Jesus, the Head of Zion, sheds on those who are of Zion walking in the path of the light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">January 30</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord shall bring again Zion.—Isaiah 52:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Prior to 1874 A. D. the Lord’s people for the most part were languishing in Babylon under ecclesiasticism, and Zion was as a captive daughter. Thereafter Jehovah sent forth his command: “Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.” It was by the carrying out of this command by the Elijah class under their Head, Christ Jesus, that Jehovah brought again Zion, bringing her out of captivity and giving her a proper position in his arrangement and also freedom of activity in his service. The regathered saints have specially appreciated this great deliverance and restoration since the Lord has come to his temple. Therefore Zion’s watchmen now vehemently lift up their voices, seeing eye to eye throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to .wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 107:40</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Princes are favored ones in the courts of the earth; they do not possess the highest authority, but occupy only a minor position in government. They may well picture the ecclesiastical wing of Satan’s world organization. These princes have been rebellious. While Jehovah’s faithful ones have stood in awe of his Word, these princes have persecuted them without a cause; they did sit in judgment and speak against them. (Psalm 119: 23, 161) Now their day of visitation has come. Already he has poured out contempt upon them in the form of warnings, indictments, and adverse testimonies; and he has contemned them in taking away from them the kingdom and giving it to a nation bringing forth the fruit thereof. In the wilderness which Satan has made in the earth, they wander with no way to flee or escape Armageddon.—Jeremiah 25: 35.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord will not forsake his people for his great name’s sake; because it hath pleased the Lord to make you his people. — 1 Samuel 12:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah will uphold the dignity of his Word and his name. He chose the Israelites for his own purpose. Because he did this he refused to forsake them. When attacked by their foes he helped them. Foolishly they turned away from him, but he would not leave them. They became headstrong and wilfully perverse in rejecting his beloved Son, yet God will bring that people back to himself. The reason is that his great name and all that it means to himself is involved. He will save his people for his name’s sake. In this day God has raised up a Servant class for the honor of his name and to them he says: “Ye are my witnesses that I am God.” This means that they must go forth and give the witness to the glory of his name. It is a great consolation to the saints to know that God will not forsake them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">February 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks: . . . This shall ye have of mine hand, ye shall lie down in sorrow.—Isa. 50:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The true Christians should never look to man or men as the source of light, and wantonly kindle their own spark-giving fires for illumination. Nominal Christendom, as we now see it, has fallen into this very snare. The ecclesiastical leaders have put away the Word of God, the Lamp that Jehovah lit to lighten the Christian’s pathway, and have walked in their own wisdom, and the people with them. Some of these leaders have been more brilliant than other men and have leaped out into prominence. Their natural brilliancy and lack of humility were a misfortune to them. Jehovah likens their brilliancy merely to sparks that flare up and soon disappear in the darkness. The people have walked in the light of this ecclesiastical fire and its sparkling bright lights. They now lie down in sorrow. Let us shed on them the cheering light of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">February 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.—2 Corinthians 4:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Jehovah created the earth he made thick darkness a swaddling band for it. (Job 38: 9) At his command the darkness fled away. This miracle Jehovah has repeated in a far grander sense toward those who walk in the path of the just, the justified ones of the Christian era. He has shined in their hearts because there in the seat of their affections he has found a love of righteousness, of truth and of light. The light of the Lord- that shines in this world of mental darkness is not for those who refuse to walk in it. It is not for those who love wickedness. It is for those who do truth and who come to the shining light and who advance with it onward to perfection. Every one who receives the light of the knowledge of the glory of God receives a treasure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">February 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names.—Psalm 147:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The magnitude of God’s universe cannot be approximated by the mental powers of man. Abraham, in casting his eyes to the heavens at God’s command, could not count or tell the number of the stellar luminaries of the night. Applying the eye to great telescopes of today there burst upon the vision countless myriads, of bright shining stars which Abraham could never discern with the naked eye. Astronomers, in mapping out the heavens which can be brought within the range of our vision, calculate that there are thirty thousand million stars in our universe. But Jehovah, the Creator, has accurately tabulated the number of the celestial orbs of light and even holds in memory their originally-given names. What assurance this gives to the saints that the Lord knoweth them that are truly his and retains in his unlimited memory their names!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">February 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God loveth a cheerful giver.—2 Corinthians 9:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah is the greatest Giver, and he gives largely and cheerfully. Therefore he loves a cheerful giver, not because the giving is done unto him or that he is at all enriched by the giving, but because it reflects his likeness and savors of love. It is not the gift that Jehovah values so much as it is the glad spirit in which the gift is made, grateful for the chance to give that good might be done and the Lord glorified. We cannot always make large, bountiful gifts, but what we do give we can give cheerfully in the Lord’s spirit. The antitypical “sons of Levi” now have the opportunity as never before to be cheerful givers toward the greatest of causes. The Lord is now in kingdom power, and they may now conform to the prophetic picture and be willing in this day of his power by giving their all toward his cause. He is in his temple, purifying them that they may cheerfully offer their every faculty as “an offering in righteousness” unto the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">For 1, saith the Lord, will be unto her a wall of fire, round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.—Zechariah 2: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The glory of the Lord herein spoken of is the visible blessing of honor that he bestows upon his faithful witnesses. Glory means honor. To be singled out and distinguished or marked by the Lord’s favor is to be highly honored of the Lord. Is not then the Lord’s glory amidst his people today, inasmuch as he has singled them out and distinguished them with the exalted honor of publishing the glorious tidings of the kingdom? Are they unprotected while in this honorable service? No! True, the ranks of those in Zion were thinned down by the Lord’s gathering those that offend and do iniquity out from the kingdom class. But the Lord has added others, and more also, so that &quot;Jerusalem [has become] inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude”. Though without visible walls, Zion has Jehovah as a wall of fire round about her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">February 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.—Bom. 8:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has begotten us and anointed us with his spirit and made us his children. He has thereby made us also his heirs, to share a divine inheritance with the victorious One, Jesus, “whom he hath appointed heir of all things.” The reading of the Apostle Paul’s original letter is “if so be that we suffer together”. It bears out the thought that the suffering is shared by the heavenly Father as well as by the Son and the church, jointly by all three. It is to fellowship with this Heart of infinite love that the saints are called and begotten, to fellowship with the One who for thousands of years has been reproached by evil angels and evil men, who have not understood and who have sought to thwart his benevolent designs and thus have caused him sorrow-. Let us share his sufferings, and prove worthy as his heir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">February 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.—Exodus 20:</span><span class="font3"> 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord did not give Israel his name for her convenience and selfish gratification, but because he had a well-defined purpose in so doing. He did not give the church of Christ his name for her convenience or selfish gratification. He who uses the name of God for selfish ends takes the name of God in vain. There is no more glaring example of the violation of this injunction than the course organized Christianity or Christendom has taken. His name has been taken and used by that system for selfish gratification. The clergy are particularly guilty of this wrong. The same thing applies to some elders and others who claim to be in present truth. All Christians must learn this lesson. The name of the Lord is given to his people that they might show forth his praises by being his true and faithful witnesses. The taking or using of his name for any other purpose is taking his name in vain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">February 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ATI things are of God, who hath reconciled vs to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation. — 2 Corinthians 5:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has committed to the new creation a ministry, that is, a commission to do certain things; and this commission is a wonderful treasure, a valuable thing, and indeed the most important thing that the creature could have now. The new creature yet on earth has an earthly organism; therefore this treasure, namely, this commission or ministry of reconciliation, is given to him while in this earthen vessel. Paul tells us why “we have this treasure in earthen vessels”. He says: “That the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God, and not from ourselves.” Jehovah has thus ordained it to the end that no man in Christ may properly boast, but that the new creature might use this ministry to glorify the name of Jehovah, by telling the people that the all-excelling means of bringing life to the people is from God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">February 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.—Isa. 64:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the Christian era Jehovah reveals his deep things only to the members of his family. This family relationship is attained by exercising faith in the shed blood of Jesus, by full consecration, justification, spiritbegetting and anointing. Then the new creature begins to have the eyes of his understanding opened. As he gazes into the perfect mirror (God’s Word of Truth), and strives to reflect or conform himself to the glorious things set forth therein, the revelation grows brighter and brighter “unto the perfect day”. This revelation of the deeper things of God’s Word is not by natural keenness of perception, nor by human mental brightness, but by God’s spirit. Blessed are they who have waited for him, and whose eyes now see the temple of God in heaven opened and witness the flashes of the lightning of his truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">February 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, I lay in Zion . . . a tried stone.—Isaiah 28:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Zion is God’s organization; and one of its chief purposes is to recover mankind and to establish and rule the world in righteousness. The Stone is God’s anointed King, the One appointed and anointed to carry out God’s plan. His anointing took place at the time of his baptism in the Jordan. For three and one-half years thereafter he was subject to severe trials. Finally he was offered to Israel as King, and was rejected. In a parallel manner Jesus began the ousting of Satan from heaven in 1914. Three and one-half years later he came to his temple. Thereabouts Jehovah offered him as King to all Christians. Nominal Christendom rejected him. Other professed Christians fell over The Stone, while upon others The Stone fell and ground them to powder. He is now the Head and Chief Corner Stone, and the true temple class give witness thereof to all the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">February 12</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Matthew 22: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah is the great King who has made the marriage for his Son, Christ Jesus. That the members of the church may be made ready for the marriage Jehovah grants them wedding garments through hrs Son, to whom they are espoused. The wedding garment is a symbol of distinction to identify one as ready for the wedding. It must be worn by those expecting to be members of Christ’s bridal company. This garment does not picture justification, because it is the new creature that dons the garment and one becomes a new creature after he receives justification. It represents that which the new creature must keep on if he would win the approval of the King. Surely then it must picture the doing of Jehovah’s will, the keeping of his commandments in the way he has pointed out that the same must be done. Take heed, then! The King has come in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">February 13</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I will betroth thee unto me for ever; . . . I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness; and thou shall know the Lord.—Hosea 2:19,20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Addressing Zion, who is the mother of the kingdom class,-Jehovah says through the Prophet Isaiah: “Thy Maker is thine husband; Jehovah of hosts is his name.” Hence the words of our text apply to the- church on earth, which represents Zion. Jehovah planted the church a noble vine, wholly a right seed; but ecclesiasti-cism caused a strange vine of a degenerate plant to grow. This vine the Lord openly repudiated in 1919, and soon it will be trodden in the wine-press. But the remnant in Zion is now being gathered to Jehovah. He is making them to know him. He is proving their loyalty to him. He knows that this proved class will ever be faithful unto him. Therefore he lovingly assures them that they shall never be estranged from him, but be joined to him and his glorious Son, for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thou art my hiding place; thou shall preserve me from trouble; thou shall compass me about with songs of deliverance.—Psalm 32:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Trouble surrounds the church, but God becomes her hiding jplace. The floods of trouble envelop others, but shall not come nigh to the chosen of the Lord. Those who are of the temple class, and who are therefore under the robe of righteousness, appreciate the fact that the times are perilous, never was danger so great; yet at the same time they feel absolutely secure in the strength of the Lord. They find that Jehovah has compassed them about with songs of deliverance, and they sing for joy. Surely this is the happy condition of the temple class at this time. They know that the time of deliverance is at hand, even as Jesus long ago told them to expect. Therefore they lift up the head and let their lips echo the songs of deliverance that others might hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">February 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God; . . . and swear by his name.—Deuteronomy 10:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The words of this text were in no wise contradicted by Jesus. (Matthew 5: 33-37) God swears by his own name. (Isaiah 45:23) Those who honestly make a covenant in the name of Christ to do the will of God swear by the name of Jehovah. Such is a full consecration. These ‘swear to their hurt and change not’. (Psalm 15: 4) This is time because fulfilling their consecration leads to death. Such make a covenant, and perform it at any and all cost. These swear full allegiance to God and to Christ, and fully trust in the Lord. That “faithful and wise servant” class has made an oath by and to the name of God to do his will. Having done so, these fear God and fear to depart from that covenant. Their confidence in the Lord is complete, and they depend on no arm of flesh. Trusting in the Lord they go on to do his will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the residue of wrath shall thou-gird upon thee.—Psalm 76:10, Revised Version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;The weakness of God is stronger than men.” Jehovah’s plans and arrangements have seemed to men to be weak because they have permitted the wrath of man to assert itself and have permitted wickedness and evil devices seemingly to triumph. But in these very respects Jehovah will display his strength by completely reversing what the enemy intended and by making their activities serve in conjunction with his good purposes. He will make all work out for the good of those who love him, and thus will enhance his praise. As in the case of Pharaoh, he lets the wrath of his enemies rise to its whitest heat. When their wrath is come to the full, then it remains for him to gird wrath on him to uphold him (Isaiah 63:5) while he shows forth his power over the enemy and makes a name for himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">February 17</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">So thou, O son of man, 1 have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shall hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Ezekiel 33: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The word watchman, when properly defined, includes the thought of leaning forward to penetrate into the distance, of observing and taking heed to orders and acting accordingly. Through his beloved Son, the great Watcher over the interests of his own has put his anointed ones on guard as watchmen to watch the interests of the Messianic kingdom and to testify from time to time to the unfolding of his plan. These are not looking out for self-interests, nor are they making a studied effort to reach some easy place in the heavenly kingdom. They forget self; they warn their brethren and others who are in danger; they observe the word at Jehovah’s mouth, and seek always to honor his name and to serve him. They sing in their hearts, singing the praises of Jehovah God and his mighty Son Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are a great deep: 0 Lord, thou preservest man and beast.—Psalm 36:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Righteousness marks all the acts and works of Jehovah, and it shall stand forth prominently for ever like “mountains of God” (margin). His judgments are laid deep in the unfathomable depths of his wisdom, and shall therefore never fail nor go astray. Modern savants frighten men with fears that in time this earth shall become a dead planet and creature life become extinct upon it; while militarists devise and prepare for the next war, that imperils the life of every human being. Jehovah in his righteousness has rendered judgment, and it shall stand. His decision is to carry millions alive through the great day of battle and to recreate and preserve the dead members of Adam’s family in the regeneration under Christ’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">February 19</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein: for he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.—Psalm 24:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In preparing the literal earth for man’s habitation, God gathered into basins the waters of the deep that covered the face of our planet, and made the dry land to appear. In the terrific deluge that destroyed the old world, the flood waters covered even the high hills; but Jehovah made the flood waters to assuage and the dry land to appear, and another world was founded upon it. Once again “the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves”, but this time they are the floods of the ungodly and conscienceless who would swell and overwhelm all humanity. But again will it be proven that “the Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than mighty waves of the sea”. He will rebuke them and will establish the new world upon or in spite of the storm-struck seas and floods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He shall give his angels charge over thee, io keep thee in all thy ways.—Psalm 91:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The great Jehovah has given the Servant class a work to do, and has commissioned his angels to watch over them and to defend them from the attacks of the enemy. The angels have a charge or sacred trust concerning the Servant class. The members of this class, who now dwell in the secret place of the Most High, may as his witnesses go forth to the performance of their sacred commission with absolute assurance that the mighty angels of heaven, who always have access to the face of God, stand on guard at all times to defend and protect those who continue faithful to Jehovah. God will have the witness given to his name at this time. He has given his Servant class the great privilege of giving that witness; and to them he says: ‘My angels have charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">February 21</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">In this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.—Isaiah 25: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Both along with the World War and also since then, the earth has borne great famines; and more millions have died from want and scarcity than from the war. But not far distantly the new covenant will be inaugurated; and Jehovah will bless the people in their homes, in their corn, their wine, their fruits, their herds and their flocks. He will relieve them of profiteers. He will bring them to an accurate knowledge of the truth and bless them with health, happiness and life abundantly. It will indeed be a feast of fat things; and all the people, being comforted in their hearts, will learn to sing the praises of Jehovah. It is now the blessed privilege of the church to inform the groaning creation of these marvelous blessings that are just ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.—Psalm 99:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was by the name Jehovah that God dealt with Pharaoh and destroyed the power of the Devil’s representative in Egypt. That name was terrible then. It will be terrible to all who oppose God now, because it is his expressed purpose to break down the bulwarks of the enemy. This text calls upon all people to acknowledge Jehovah as God. All must do this before they can receive the blessings of life. They must praise him before they can enter into the enjoyment of those blessings. Jehovah’s name is holy. The people must come to know that he is fully and completely righteous, that he is the perfect expression of righteousness; and they must acknowledge him as such. To this end God now says to his anointed ones: “Ye are my witnesses that I am God.’’ It is now the privilege and responsibility of the anointed to sing forth the honor of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">February 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. —1 Peter 5:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A proud person is one who overrates his own excellencies and becomes presumptuous before the Lord and therefore lawless. Such will not be submissive to the ways of the Lord. A humble person does not think too highly of himself. He has full faith and confidence that Jehovah is at the helm and is capable of handling his own affairs; that he causes his work to be done according to his own good way, and that he has but one way. Such humbly and gladly submit to the Lord. The proud ones do not progress in the light shining upon the divine plan, but in due course lose the spirit of the Lord and of the truth because God resists them. The humble ones are the constant recipients of God’s favor. They delight to honor him as the Author of all truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">If the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you.—Rom. 8:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The word “quicken” as here used means to vitalize; to energize; to enliven; to cause to move with rapidity. It means to do something to the Lord’s glory, and not to remain inactive. It means to glorify God with the body, which is his. The holy spirit, the spirit of Jehovah, is so mighty that it raised up Jesus from the dead. It is logically able also to make alive, energize, the human body to activity in service for righteousness, even though that body was once given over to sin. The new creature now is responsible for the mortal body. Hence the spirit of Jehovah dwelling in him should lead him to use his strength, energy, time, influence, money, and everything he has, to the Lord’s glory. He who faithfully does so unto the end of his earthly life, shall be resurrected in a divine body by God’s spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">February 25</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Isaiah 60: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Like the ninth plague that afflicted Egypt just before the deliverance of Israel came, the gross darkness enshrouding the earth today is a darkness that can be felt; and the people are much pained. The rulers’ hearts are failing them for fear. But “unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness”; for Jehovah has risen upon Zion as a great Sun, and she stands as though clothed with the golden beams of the great Star of day. The full light of the kingdom message is hers. The glory of Jehovah as manifested in his loving favor and his unfailing protection is also seen upon her. God’s prophet, looking forward to the unique position of the temple class in this time, rouses them to action with the cry: “Arise, shine; for thy light is come.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Matthew 25: 34</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On the earth at this time there are millions of people of good will, who sincerely desire a better condition for themselves and for others, but who are not alive to Jehovah’s way. Many of these see the efforts put forth by God’s witnesses in telling of the good tidings of the kingdom; and insofar as they can they are moved to extend aid and comfort to God’s servants because they are his servants. This they do because of the good that is still in them. It is for such sheeplike, inoffensive ones that Jehovah has prepared the kingdom from the foundation of the world. Many of this righteously disposed class of people will pass through the coming trouble and be the first ones to have a trial for restoration. On proving their righteousness when God’s judgments are in the earth, Jehovah will bless them through the Christ and will welcome them into life eternal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">February 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord... frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and malceth diviners mad; . . . confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers.—Isaiah 44: 24-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The lying prophets of Christendom, whom Jehovah did not send and to whom he spake not, sanctified war and held out plausible tokens of the Lord’s blessing upon the nations that engaged in the war. They divined that much spiritual good would result from the war, and that the world would be purged by its great trial and made “safe for democracy”. They have given their manifesto and votes as tokens that the League of Nations is “the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth”. Subsequent events to date have proved that they are mad, wild, in their false divinations; for the Lord is frustrating all their tokens and exposing them as false prophets. But the word of his Servant class, whom he truly sent forth as his messengers, is steadily being confirmed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord said unto Moses, See, 1 have made thee a god to Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.—Exodus 7:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah sent Aaron with Moses to Egypt to act as a mouthpiece for Moses. It was Aaron’s business to talk. Soon thereafter Egypt was overthrown that Jehovah might make a name for himself. Now in the end of the world God will overthrow Satan and his organization;, of which Pharaoh and Egypt were types. He has made Jesus, pictured by Moses, “the mighty God” (Isaiah 9:6), to do this stupendous work. Jesus’ brethren, the members of his body who are on earth, are pictured by Aaron; and these Jehovah has made the spokesmen of the invisible One to declare the message of the Lord to the peoples of earth. Jehovah requires faithfulness on the part of these spokesmen.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor -riches; feed me with food convenient for me; lest I . . . take the name of my God in vain.—Proverbs 30:8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This is a prayer of the wise man who desires to have his way right in the sight of God. Applying his knowledge according to God’s will makes man wise. Vanity and lies lead to disapproval and destruction. Extreme riches or extreme poverty unbalances man. Great material wealth tends to induce the possessor to forget his obligation to God. Extreme poverty often leads to depression and despair. Desiring the approval of God the Christian prays that he may be fed with the food of convenience. This does not mean whatsoever is at hand. It means whatsoever is proper, fit and necessary for the Christian’s nourishment and upbuilding. Being all in one body, all require this food from the same source and of the same kind. The Lord has made ample provision for this food. The “wise and faithful servant” class feed upon the food the Lord has graciously provided, and together they delight to sing forth the honor of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.—Hebrews 1: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the beginning the Logos was always in harmony with his Father and always was his delight. The other morning star turned to lawlessness, but the loyal Son hated lawlessness and loved righteousness. For this reason Jehovah anointed him to the highest place, far above all others of his creation. Hereby is the rule of God proven that he who devotes himself wholly to God is always rewarded. This is not selfishness on Jehovah’s part, but it is prompted entirely by love. God is righteous. All who faithfully serve God must follow righteousness. All the righteous shall live. Such is the law of God. The reward is to all who delight to be obedient to God. Obedience means to keep his commandments and to do so joyfully.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.—Psalm 23: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Losing faith, the children of Israel cried: “Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?” Jehovah did not fail them, nor has he ever failed his people. In the tabernacle arrangement, he provided for the priests’ bread by having a table of shewbread stationed in the holy of the tabernacle. The enemies are not permitted to interfere with Jehovah’s feeding of his people. The great enemy, Satan the Dragon, has been expelled from heaven, and is especially near now; and all the church’s enemies would come upon her and eat her flesh, but they stumble and fall. And while the vicious Dragon looks on, Jehovah provides spiritual meat and commands his earthly organization: “Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink.” (Isaiah 21:5) Never may we say, as did unappreciative ones in Malachi’s day, “The table of the Lord is contemptible”; but let us give thanks in faith for what the Lord provides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">See, I have this day set thee over the nations, and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.—J eremiah 1:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jeremiah’s commission represents that given to God’s anointed ones. Jehovah has set them over the nations to declare unto them the uprooting, pulling down, throwing down and destruction that is in store for earth’s iniquitous systems, and the upbuilding and planting irremovably of the new heavens and the new earth. The proclamation of this program of Jehovah must be given before many peoples, nations, and kings (Revelation 10:11); and it must be given by the anointed ones with zeal for Jehovah and without fear. There can be no slacking of their hand now. Great is the honor bestowed upon them. With Christ Jesus and the members of his body on the other side of the vail, they are to have a part in the great battle of Armageddon, which shall crush the international “vine of the earth” and its fruitage. None others will have a part therein. Faithfulness .brings them a heavenly reward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">March 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.—John 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God loves the oppressed people of the world. So great is his love that he gave his only begotten Son that the people might not perish, but that those who should hear and obey might live. It would be just like Jehovah to make everything ready for them to hear at the proper time. For more than six thousand years man has been alienated from God. Anticipating the time of the glad return of the exiles unto himself, God through his prophet bids his anointed Servant class to mark out to them the way that leads to life. He tells them to go and make ready the road for the entry of the people; to bank up the causeway; to gather out the stones; and then to lift up a standard to which the people may rally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations: which covenant he made with Abraham, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">his oath unto Isaac.—Psalm 105:8,9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As they behold his work among the Jews in this eventful period of history, those who are of the faith of Abraham can surely bear witness that Jehovah has remembered his covenant. Jehovah confirmed the covenant unto Israel, saying, <sup>f</sup>TJnto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of thine inheritance.” Modern facts forcefully prove that he has not forgotten his promise to Israel throughout all the thousand or more generations which have been born since the covenant was made. He is today prospering the word of his covenant in a most perceptible manner; for the natural sons and daughters of Abraham are returning thousands upon thousands to the promised land. The time has come therefore for the spiritual seed of Abraham to say unto the cities of Judaism: “0 ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.” “Seek Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">March 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.—Micah 7: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah is “the God of truth”. He keeps covenant and shows mercy. Jacob prayed: “I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant.” The truth that Jehovah revealed to Jacob grew out of his mercy to Abraham. He had showed unto Abraham his covenant, which promised blessings to all the families of the earth. God will perform all this truth and the terms of mercy in the Abrahamic covenant, and Abraham and Jacob shall themselves witness its performance when Messiah’s kingdom wakens them to life. Jehovah gave his own word, and he swore to it by his own name. The Apostle Paul tells us that he did this that we, the heirs </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">God’s promise, might have strong consolation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. —Luke 11:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore he is our Father in heaven, because he gives us life through Christ. To those who enjoy this intimate relationship with God his name is hallowed. It is pure, holy and sacred. The child of God venerates and reveres his Father’s name. Familiarity is not permissible. Prayer is a great favor. God permits his children to pray to him for their good and for the advancement of his righteous cause, and not for the purpose of permitting familiarity with him. The servant of God cannot use this privilege for his own selfish interests. Before the petition of the Christian is presented to God the commandment is to say, &quot;Hallowed be thy name,” and then ask in harmony with the will of God. Such prayer is an honor to God’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">March 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation.—Psalm 149:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The people of God here mentioned are those wholly devoted to him. They follow in the ways of the truth not for selfish reasons, but because they delight to serve God. They are meek because they think of themselves only as the favored servants of the Most High. Their delight is to honor his name, knowing that the reward he will grant will be far greater than they could now imagine. They dismiss all fears, because their love is perfect. The Lord takes pleasure in them. This pleasure he manifests by placing them under his protection; and in the day of his wrath against the evil one’s organization Jehovah completely shields and preserves them as his own. Unto them he will be a crown of glory and a diadem of beauty. He adorns them with the robe of righteousness and the garments of salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.—Psalm 107: 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The storm pictures Jehovah’s fight against the iniquitous empire of the Devil in the battle of Armageddon. Jehovah commands the fight to begin, and the Prophet David describes the tempestuous waves of trouble stirred up by the stormy wind that Jehovah raises up. In the deep distress that smites the nations they will discern the Lord; that is, they will see the manifestation of his power in the troublesome events. “Their soul is melted because of trouble. They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit’s end.” This great tribulation will so humble the hearts of men that they will cry unto the Lord; and he will lift them up and establish peace, lasting peace, on earth. He will bring them to their desired haven, God’s kingdom; and there “nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">March 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.—Daniel 2:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Nothing is hid from the knowledge of Jehovah God. “Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee: but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.” (Psalm 139:12) The secrets of men are known to him because the day comes when he shall judge them by his Son Jesus Christ. But Jehovah has deep secrets of his own pertaining to his designs toward his saints and toward the human family. These secret things are impossible for human insight to penetrate and know; they are as dark sayings to human minds. “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will show them his covenant.” To them he reveals his deep secrets by the power of his spirit, as these secrets become due to be understood by his servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.—Revelation 14:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The vine of the earth is the wicked organization of which the Devil is the head. It produces the grapes of the earth, the fruit of wickedness. The winepress is Jehovah’s. It is the instrument or means which he uses to crush the life-blood out of the grapes of the earth. He employs in the treading process his beloved Son, who is willingly and joyfully supported by his faithful body members. No one this side the vail can see every detail of the operation of God’s winepress. The earnest watchmen of the temple of God, however, can see that it means the agency which Jehovah will employ to annihilate that wicked system that has long defamed his name and oppressed the human race. Seeing the wonderful results that will follow the treading of the vine of the earth in the battle of Armageddon, these watchmen are thrilled and sing for joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">March 12</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Appoint out for you cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses.—Joshua 20:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s provision in the law given through Moses for six cities of refuge must be a shadow of something to follow. Accordingly Satan, who has the power of death, seems surely to be the avenger of blood. The consecrated Christian is the one who flees to the city of refuge; for in making a consecration and being accepted of the Lord for sacrifice he agrees in effect to the slaying of his humanity, the putting to death of the old man. Christ Jesus is the city of refuge to which Jehovah has ordained and made a way that he shall flee from the vengeance of Satan. As the preservation of the unwitting slayer of old depended upon his faithfully abiding in the city of refuge until the death of the high priest, even so the preservation of the saints depends upon faithfully abiding in Christ until the high-priestly class is completed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall he comforted in Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Isaiah 66:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The effort of the enemy is to discourage and frighten the Lord’s servants and thereby to weaken them and cause their spirit to mourn and their hands to hang limp and inactive at their sides. On the other hand the Lord comforts those who are in his organization, Jerusalem, with all the tenderness of a mother consoling her child. To comfort means to strengthen, to make confident and fearless, to make cheerful and of good hope. The need of comfort implies testings. Of these the last members of the body of Christ seem to be marked out for their portion; but while they are passing through their fiery experiences, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort will not leave his own comfortless. Whatsoever is written in his Word is written for their encouragement and comfort, that they might patiently endure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">March 14</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">0 Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 8:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The prophet voices the praise of God’s people as they see his name being exalted in the earth. The clouds which hide the sun from view symbolize the things of Satan and his organization which have hid the name of God. In his own due time Jehovah exalts his name and sets his glory above all, of things both seen and unseen. After this begins his faithful “servant” class is called upon to magnify and declare the honor of God’s name and purpose before mankind. “They glory in the name of the Lord,” which means that they desire to do his will. He has commissioned these to do his service, and they rejoice to do it. This cannot be done by merely talking about the Lord, but by doing his will. The conditions under which his servants work are often trying and exciting, but they are accompanied with great joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth' my praise.—Isaiah 43:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has formed or organized spiritual Israel not for his selfish enjoyment but for his altruistic purposes. He has not called the church merely in order to take a limited number into heaven. True, the heavenly glory will be the great reward of the faithful. However, faithfulness is a condition precedent and one which is required to be proven before the one who possesses it can be taken into heavenly glory. Peter plainly states that God has called his church out of darkness into marvelous light that the members thereof might show forth his praise. It follows, therefore, that faithfulness must be manifested in showing abroad his praises; and this must be done at least to a degree this side the vail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">March 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thou art worthy, 0 Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Revelation 4:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All the creatures of the universe, the Logos, the divine family, angels, cherubim, seraphim, man, the beasts of the field, .the fowl of the air, and whatsoever passeth through the depths of the seas, all were created by Jehovah. The inanimate things of this realm of existence, the sun, moon, and stars, things visible and invisible, indescribably grand, all emanate from his creative powers. Did God create all these wonders for his selfish pleasure ? That he derives pleasure therefrom should not argue selfishness on his part. Jehovah delights and finds pleasure in activity and work of creation. He properly experiences pleasure in seeing creatures that he approves happy and blessed. He is love. If love is unselfishness perfectly expressed, how could Jehovah’s unselfishness have been expressed toward anyone or anything had he, who was originally alone, not engaged in creation? Truly he is worthy of worship, not alone as Creator but as Love personified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thou hast sinned: therefore 1 will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and 1 will destroy thee, 0 covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.—Ezekiel 28:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That the end of Satan is destruction there should be no doubt. That his destruction will be deferred until his wicked works are destroyed is also sure. (Hebrews 2:14; 1 John 3: 8) The great author of sin and the relentless opposer of righteousness shall not live for ever as a blot on Jehovah’s creation. This means that eventually peace shall reign in earth as well as now in heaven, and that Jehovah’s will shall be done on earth as it is done in his own official court. Since the coming of the kingdom in 1914 and the warfare in heaven that followed, this erstwhile covering cherub has been cast out of the mountain of God as an unreformably profane creature. Let no one be deceived into thinking that he will be recovered to virtue and to Jehovah’s realm of holiness. In his eventual destruction the justice and truth of God’s ways will be made manifest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">March 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">For this God is our God for ever and ever; he will be our guide even unto death.—Psalm 48:14-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Why then should we be anxious about the future? Armed with the message of truth which proceeds out of their mouth like a sharp sword, held by Jehovah in the shadow of his hand, and protected as a hunter protects his arrows in his quiver, let the anointed ones go forth to the battle, singing the praises of Jehovah as they go. Let fear be flung to the winds; and, moved by a burning zeal for the Lord, let the saints march on under the guidance of Jehovah to victory and to the kingdom of God. Arouse the great company class. Bid them leave their dark prisons and come forth and take their stand on the Lord’s side. Hold on high tire standard of the Lord for the people. Point them to the highway. Grand now is your work, ye anointed ones! Blessed are all they who participate therein!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Before 1 formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou earnest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee; and 1 ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.—Jeremiah 1: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For forty years prior to Jerusalem’s first destruction Jeremiah prophesied respecting it and the nations. Peter assures us that Jeremiah did not realize the full significance of God’s words to him, but that they apply particularly to us upon whom the ends of the ages are come. Jehovah foreknew his remnant class in this end of the age before ever that rem-nant emerged into its present great work. Foreknowing the work they would do he inspired Jesus to prophesy: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations.” Hence he sanctified or set apart the remnant class, which he was forming or preparing, to this work. When the Lord came to his temple and the spirit was poured out upon all flesh, there Jehovah ordained the remnant to stand forth and testify as his mouthpiece to the nations. What strength the knowledge of Jehovah’s supervision gives to us!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">March 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">For thus saith the Lord God, Behold I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Ezekiel 34:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Jehovah is my shepherd.” “We are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand.” His faithful Son is the good Shepherd who gave his life for the sheep. For centuries the hireling “shepherds and the principal of the flock” have made havoc of Jehovah’s sheep. Now the day of deliverance has come; and Jehovah, even Jehovah, is engaged in searching and seeking out his sheep. Those who respond to his message, he feeds in good pasture and makes to lie down in a good fold. Since the Lord Jesus has taken his seat on his glorious throne for judging the nations, Jehovah uses </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font3"> to bless those sheeplike ones of mankind who do good unto his sheep, his saints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">That thy name is near, thy wondrous works declare. —Psalm 75:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah is now doing his works in the earth. These things seen by the anointed servants are evidences to them that God himself is near and is taking a hand in the affairs of the earth. Some works he must do by forces other than his people on earth. Almost all his work on earth done by the anointed is the making proclamation to the honor of his name. Opportunities they have now to serve him in declaring his name are proof to the anointed that God is using them, and that therefore they have his approval. Such is further proof that now is God’s due time to have his name declared in the earth. With a clearer vision of God’s purposes concerning them, the anointed can go on in his work with full confidence. They are not so much concerned about how long they must continue to work on earth, nor how great the danger of attack from the enemy; but they are concerned about faithfulness to their covenant. With serenity they sing forth the honor of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">March 22</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it; because that in it he had rested from all his work which God had created and made. — Genesis 2: S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Jehovah had created man in his own image, he then “rested” from all his work. Of course, this must be understood to mean that he rested from all his work insofar as that work relates to things made which pertain to the earth. Having blessed man with the faculties and strength to subdue the earth, he left man to do the work of extending Paradise earth-wide. Wow that man has fallen in sin and death, Jehovah has committed that work to the great Executor of his plan, meantime continuing in his rest. He has blessed his seven-thousand-year day of rest, ordaining that the outcome of it shall be blessed to all concerned. Man by his disobedient course has filled the day with sorrows; but Jehovah has steadily continued to mark this day with mercy and goodness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there.—Psalm 87: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has predestinated that Christ’s glorified body shall comprise one hundred and forty-four thousand members. Each member is to be born in Zion, the heavenly city of God, in the first resurrection. The Lord is supremely interested in this elect company, and he counts them as they are born in Zion. He will continue to count until the last member is born to make the elect number complete. Not one member shall be left out of the count or overlooked, because Jehovah can tell even the number of the stars. Jehovah is not ashamed of them, because they have not been ashamed to confess him as their God on earth. Because they sing forth the honor of his name unto the end, their names “written in heaven” shall not be blotted out of the book of life, but God will publish to all creation that these faithful ones have been born in Zion above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">March 24</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy.—Psalm 145:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The enemy is vigorous and powerful. He is seeking to destroy the members of the body of Christ. All his forces are arrayed against the seed of promise. However, these latter, observing the rules or laws which the Lord, has laid down, are safe from all harm. Jehovah preserveth them. Their continued safety depends upon their loving devotion and faithfulness to the Lord and his cause. Pleadingly the Lord therefore says to them through his prophet: “0 love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord preserveth the faithful.” As the enemy advances to the assault let each member of the body remember that the battle is not his, but Jehovah’s. The Lord is leading, and he is certain of victory. Observe the orders of the Leader, carry on strenuously in the conflict, and trust to the Lord for preservation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">March 25</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very swiftly.—Psalm 147:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Whatsoever Jehovah commands or orders, that thing surely comes to pass or into being. The unintelligent creations and forces of nature and of the universe obey his commands; but his special creation, his saints, distinguish themselves by </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">intelligent</span><span class="font3"> obedience to his commands. Since the great World War Jehovah has sent forth his commandment, to his saints on earth in these words: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness.” And readily and joyfully the faithful saints respond. In consequence of their willingness and in view of the Lord’s blessing, his Word runs very swiftly to all the nations of earth as a testimony. It also rushes through the air at the rate of one hundred and eighty thousand and three hundred miles a second by means of the radio waves, penetrating even the walls of the houses and bringing to the people the most gladsome tidings ever broadcast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">March 26</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.—Psalm 91: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It seems certain that “the fowler” here named is the Devil; and that his snare consists of the methods he employs, and also of his organization, working in divers and numerous deceptive ways to entrap those who claim to be servants of the Most High God. Thus it is that the Apostle Paul mentions “the snare of the devil”; and his accompanying language indicates that those taken captive at Satan’s will have not been diligent in departing from iniquity or lawlessness toward the Lord. The false prophet system is undoubtedly one of the snares of the devilish fowler; for the Prophet Hosea (9:8) says: “The-prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the house of his God.” He who is in the secret place of the Most High and who continues to abide there cannot be touched by the enemy’s snare, nor by the destructive pestilence of pride, ambition and selfishness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Daniel 6:22</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Daniel, as a member of that “cloud of witnesses” of whom the world was not worthy, was innocent before the Lord, and hence Jehovah shut the lions’ mouth. Looking back at the enemies of the Lord’s people who rose up during the World War and would have swallowed up the church alive, we too can say: “Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.” Today the great accuser of the brethren, deposed from heaven, roams abroad as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour; but we know that our innocency is established before Jehovah because we are under the robe of righteousness. As long as we faithfully engage in his service, the lion’s mouth is shut.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">March 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">There Abram called on the name of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Genesis 13:4</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The fact that the name Jehovah was known to the ancients does not contradict the statement recorded by Moses that theretofore he had not been known by that name. Abraham and his sons worshiped Jehovah as their personal God who called them for his purpose, but they did not know the meaning of his name. To Abraham his name meant communion, because he called upon that name. To Abraham he was the Self-existing One, the Almighty God. Immediately following the announcement of his name as Jehovah, he explained to Moses that his name Jehovah signifies his purpose toward his people. Today the anointed of Jehovah have a better understanding of his purpose toward them than they once had. Now they see that among his purposes is that they must declare the honor of his name among the nations because the time is at hand when he will make his name glorious in the earth. They call upon his name, and intelligently and joyfully sing forth his praises.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God . . . hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Corinthians 3: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The members of Christ’s body do not make the new covenant, but they are servants to the spirit of that covenant. What is the spirit of that new covenant? It is the reconciliation of the human race to Jehovah. The members of the new creation are made ministers in connection with that work. The ministration of the new covenant is life; for it will bring life to the obedient ones of the human race because of the merit of Christ and the perfect ministration by the Lord Jesus Christ. At this time there is a preliminary work of testifying regarding the new covenant to be done, and later there is a work of teaching. Those who are serving in the spirit of the new covenant are privileged to behold with unveiled face the Lord’s glory and thus grow like him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">March 30</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">It is the sacrifice of the Lord’s passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel... when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Exodus 12:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The memorial of the Passover as celebrated by the Jews was not to glorify or eulogize primarily the lamb but was to exalt Jehovah, who provided the means of deliverance and who intervened in their behalf with a display of mighty power. Hence the purpose of the Passover and the demonstration of Jehovah’s power in conjunction with it was to glorify God and convince the people that Jehovah is the Almighty God, that there is none other besides him, and that all who receive his means of salvation and obey him are absolutely certain to receive the blessings he has promised. Likewise, in memorializing the sacrifice of our Passover Lamb, Christ Jesus, we should seek first of all to extol and honor Jehovah, giving thanks to him for providing a Lamb for our salvation and deliverance as well as that of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">And this day shall he unto you for a memorial; . . . for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day. — Exodus 12: H, 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Why should Jehovah command Israel to keep the Passover as a memorial each year? Evidently that they might not forget that Jehovah is the Almighty God, their Friend and Benefactor, and the only Source of life. Hence, in enjoining upon his disciples the keeping of the Memorial of his death Jesus followed the course that his heavenly Father took. He knew that the safety of all his followers depends upon faithfulness to Jehovah and to himself. Therefore he knew that if his disciples would keep constantly before their minds the reason why he, the Lamb of God, had died, and that this reason was that they might be delivered from Satan and live, then they would be better enabled to resist the Devil and stand firmly for Jehovah and his cause. The real purpose of the Memorial of Jesus’ death is the safety and welfare of his followers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The cup which my Father hath given me, shall 1 not drink it?—John 18:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In view of Jehovah’s benefits to us, let us thankfully drink the cup which Jesus, his Son, offers to us. By inviting us to drink the Memorial wine Jesus was not simply inviting us to accept and believe on his blood as providing the price of redemption for ourselves and all mankind. He was also plainly inviting us to suffer death with him, because the wine symbolized his blood and drinking blood was punished among the Jews with the death penalty. That this was his meaning is supported by his statement: “Except ye eat the flesh of the S&gt;on of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.” In other words, only those who are broken with Christ will receive inherent life, immortality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">April 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The blood shall be to you a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you.—Exodus 12:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The law covenant was made in Egypt between God on one side and Moses as a mediator for the people on the other side; and the blood testifying thereto was the blood of the Passover lamb, which blood also furnished a special protection to the first-borns. The new covenant was made on earth between Jehovah on one side and Christ Jesus as Mediator for the people on the other side, at the time of the breaking of the bread and the drinking of the wine the night before our Lord’s death. The blood testifying to this new covenant was the blood of Christ Jesus (Matthew 26:28), and it has furnished a special protection to the “church of the firstborn” throughout the Christian era. The Lord Jesus’ followers will be passed over and saved from the “second death” if they faithfully abide under the covering of that blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">April 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Examine me, 0 Lord, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.—Psalm 26: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This should be the attitude of all the anointed ones at Memorial time. For a person may claim to be consecrated to Jehovah, and indeed be consecrated, and have a vision of the Devil’s organization and of God’s organization, and yet try to have fellowship with both. But he cannot be faithful to Jehovah unless he refuses to lend his influence, sympathy and love to Satan’s organization. “Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and the table of devils.” Let all the consecrated then submit themselves to examination in the light of Jehovah’s Word and see if they can truthfully say: “I have consecrated my life to the Lord. With me it is God first and all the time. Unreservedly I will support his cause. I delight to identify myself with his organization, of which Christ Jesus is the Head.” All who can say so may partake of the Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord.—Psalm 116:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The prophet of God put these words into the mouth of Jesus when in Gethsemane. The cup he was called upon to drink was a bitter one. It meant death to him. He saw that as the only way of being obedient to his Father, and that his existence depended upon doing his Father’s will. The bitter cup became to him a cup of salvation. In his time of need he called upon the name of Jehovah. The followers of Jesus have a like potion poured for them which they must drink. However hard the appointed way of the Lord may appear for them, it is the way to immortality. By calling upon his name Jesus showed that he understood God’s purpose concerning him. Now his followers have come to know Jehovah’s purpose toward them. They see that the cup marks the way of loving service and leads to death, and that such is their way to life. They call upon the name of the Lord with full confidence. They delight to honor his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">April 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">My Father giveth you the true tread from heaven. For the tread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—John 6: 32, 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Except we eat this bread which Jehovah sent down from heaven we can never attain everlasting life. To “eat of this bread” is to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. A man eats, and therefore absorbs, natural food through his mouth. He eats or absorbs spiritual food through his mind; and when he sets his affections upon that which he believes, he is said to believe with his heart. (Romans 10:10) The world of mankind will have to eat this bread, that is, exercise belief in Jesus, during the reign of Christ, in order to get life under the terms of the new covenant. The members of the body of Christ also have to eat of this same bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thou hast multiplied the nation, thou hast increased their joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.—Isaiah 9:3, A. H. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the first Memorial supper Jesus said to his disciples : “I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.” What did he mean? The wine in the cup not only represents the blood of our Lord Jesus but it also symbolizes joy and good cheer as part of the potion that Jehovah God pours for the church. Hence drinking the wine with his faithful followers in the kingdom must refer to his sharing the joys of the kingdom with us. Now the nation has been born, and Jesus began the exercise of his kingdom power in 1914. In 1918 he came to his temple. Verily then this is the time of the application of the scripture, “Let the saints be joyful in glory”; for now it is that the Lord in his temple bids his faithful servants to enter into the joys of their Lord. Are they not then already in a measure drinking the cup of joy with Jesus? Surely 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">April 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.—1 Corinthians 6:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Blessed consolation! Jehovah demonstrated his mighty power toward Christ Jesus when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places. This same power will save us out of death and raise us to life divine. The gates of hades shall not prevail against the members of God’s church in Christ. Standing face to face with death is the greatest of all ordeals. But if one can face it, fully assured of the fact that if he is faithful Jehovah will raise him up out of death to endless life, the ordeal loses its sting. If he can appreciate the further fact that his dearh and resurrection will result in vindicating the name of Jehovah God and be to the glory of God, then he cau face the ordeal peacefully and with joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God giveth it a lody as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.—1 Corinthians 15:38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The apostle, in using the word “it”, which he says is sown corruptible and is raised incorruptible, does not refer to individual souls or beings or characters; but his reference is to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Christ as a whole.</span><span class="font3"> The Christ is made up of many members; yet they form one body. The body of Christ, consisting of these members on this earth, is a dying body. It is a body of humiliation. It is weak and dishonorable in the sight of men. Christ Jesus, the Head of The Christ, went into death dishonored of men; and all the members must follow the same course. Christ must die as the animal body and be raised out of death a spiritual body, because such is God’s plan. “That was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.” So then we must go down into death in the image of Christ Jesus, as when he died; but in the resurrection we shall bear the image of him in his heavenly nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">April 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">0 visit me with thy salvation; that I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that 1 may glory with thine inheritance.—Psalm 106:</span><span class="font3">4, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord has visited his chosen ones with salvation and has made them to see good while still in the land of the living here on earth. By one master-stroke of Jehovah in 1914 the new Nation, the new heavenly governing factor over earth, was born. Shortly thereafter the great adversary was unseated and cast out of heaven; and the cry rang throughout heaven: “Rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them.” Not only the heavens rejoiced, but “'Zion heard, and was glad”. That is, Jehovah made the children whom Zion brought forth since 1918 to rejoice in the gladness of the newborn nation. He has adorned them with the robe of righteousness and the garments of salvation. Should they not glory as his inheritance and bless him out of Zion ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should he judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">and great.—Revelation 11:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The World War, from 1914 to 1918, marked the period of the anger of the nations. Then followed the wrath of God. He placed his beloved King upon his throne. He set judgment in the earth against the nations of this world. Among those with whom God deals from that time forward are ‘they that fear his name’. There must be a good reason why God has permitted such a wide distribution of the publications bearing his message of truth, particularly since 1918. Millions of books could have been placed in the hands of the people only by reason of the blessing of the Lord. The radio also has widely disseminated the truth. Many have heard and have therefore feared the name of the Lord, and God begins to take note of such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">April 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name. —Psalm 29:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God’s anointed ones enjoy the great privilege of now representing him on the earth. This text is a call to them to give to his name the glory, honor and praise due unto him. They hear the call with delight, and hasten to obey. Amidst great opposition they are diligent in telling others of the need to render complete allegiance unto Jehovah. To the people of God this is a day of great joy. “The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his people with peace.” Those striving to be faithful witnesses unto God now experience the fulfilment of this promise. With enemies on every side opposing them they realize the strength of the Lord and sweet peace. By gladly obeying his commandments at this time the anointed have fellowship with God and with his beloved Son; and they walk on in the light, singing forth the honor of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 107: 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In all the great deliverances recorded in the </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">annals of God’s people, Jehovah comes to the fore as the great Emancipator, the great Champion of true freedom. What wonder then that it is written: “Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!” The sad condition of the “great multitude” is now becoming prominent. They have been divided in their love between Jehovah and the attractive tilings of Satan’s empire, and have contemned the Most High, who counseled them to render fulness of devotion and complete holiness to the Lord. Therefore they have been taken into bondage in Babylon, where they now sit in darkness and in the shadow of the second death, languishing in the foul cage of ecclesiasticism with every unclean bird for &quot;their companion. The time is at hand for Jehovah to free them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">April 13</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">What saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Romans 11:1..</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the time that the Elijah feature of the church’s work passed and the Elisha work began, only a remnant were filled with such zeal for Jehovah that they were joyfully willing to undertake the kingdom interests and to respond to his call, saying: “Here am I; send me.” Those who volunteered for service Jehovah has reserved for himself to carry out his purposes before he overthrows the worship of Baal, the Devil, in the battle of Armageddon. This remnant refuses to bow the knee servilely to Baal or to receive the mark of the beast or the number of his name in either forehead or hand. Emboldened by love for the true God, they courageously stand erect amid Baal’s bowing worshipers and shout: “Jehovah, he is the God.” Who will be of the remnant?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then  </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the enemy shall come in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Isaiah 59:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">World powers, commercial giants, scientists, philosophers, and ecclesiastics, all have put up their respective standards. By these the enemy Satan has come in like a flood, hoping to confuse the people and turn them in disgust away from Jehovah God. The cries of the people have come up to God, and he has commanded another standard to be raised. It is the standard of divine truth; and the spirit of Jehovah, poured out on all flesh since the Lord’s coming to his temple, causes his anointed ones to lift it aloft. The standard of the Lord serves to mark the rallying point for the people, and to define the way of righteousness and holiness through which the people must pass in order to be the recipients of the blessings which Jehovah has to give.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord shall roar from on high, ... he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth. — Jer. 25:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The treading of the wine press is a picture of the great battle of God Almighty against the Devil. It pictures the complete destruction of the enemy’s entire organization, and not merely the humiliation of false religious systems. The treading takes place during the-period of the wrath of God; it is near at hand, because since 1918 the day of God’s wrath has come. It will be a time of tribulation such as mankind has never before known. Jehovah employs Jesus and his faithful following in the treading. Prophecy pictures the Lord as going into the winefat and with his feet treading out the grapes of the vine of the earth. The last members of the body of Christ on earth who remain faithful till death are designated as &quot;the feet of him”, and therefore as a part of him they have a part to play. Jehovah shouts and roars from on high by using them as his witnesses to declare the day of his vengeance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">April 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul. Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Jeremiah 31: 25, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah had promised (verse 14): “I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the Lord.” How wondrously he has made this prophecy to go into fulfilment even this side the vail! Incidentally to the great World War, the soul of the church became weary of life, like Elijah. “Take away my life,” she said, as her soul became sorrowful amid the trialsome experiences of 1918. But in 1919 in the fall the wise virgins of the church awaked; and Jehovah multiplied the proofs and assurances to them that the kingdom was established and their Bridegroom was truly here. He began to unfold the parables and scriptures respecting the kingdom and the present honor and favor and work of the church. What fatness God’s priestly class now enjoy! How all this goodness satiates the souls of his people!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">April 17</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.—Hosea 11:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How tender is the message of Jehovah toward Israel! His taking Israel by the hand and leading him out of Egyptian bondage was a sincere manifestation of love for him. His love was again displayed when he brought his only-begotten Son out of Egypt, where Joseph and Mary had borne him as a babe. Similarly, in these days Jehovah has bestowed great love upon his church, his first-born ones, in delivering them from bondage to Egypt. He has called them out of the world, typified by Egypt, to draw near to the mount of God to worship and serve and know him. To them he says: “Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses.” (Isaiah 44:8) His admonition to them is not to go down to Egypt again, but to maintain fealty to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">April 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the Host High over all the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the earth.—Psalm 83:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s prophet here puts a prayer into the mouth of the anointed Servant class. It is a prayer that God will not remain silent, but that trouble may come upon his opponents who stand in the way of man’s deliverance. The enemies and opponents of God must be destroyed for the sake of humankind, that men may have life and blessings. The people now need to know that he who is the God of Israel, whose name alone is Jehovah, is the Almighty God, the Most High over all, and is the Deliverer and Savior of men; and that there is none other. The fact that the anointed intelligently and consistently pray this prayer would mean that their work will be in harmony therewith. The prayer is not a selfish one, but it is that the Lord will now vindicate his name and give his people the power to declare the honor thereof. It keeps the Servant class in close communion and fellowship with the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">April 19</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people. — Isaiah 49: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These words apply to the members of Christ’s body who compose the “servant” class while on earth. The application is at a time fraught with great danger to the ones performing service in the Lord’s name. Therefore the application is while the saints are on earth, and not after their glorification. The enemy goes forth to make war against the remnant of God’s people because these are the only ones who expose him. Except for divine intervention the enemy would destroy them. God makes these faithful ones his witnesses, and gives them for a covenant or solemn guarantee that the people shall have the opportunity to hear the truth. Particularly does he commission these faithful ones to carry his message to the “great multitude” in the ecclesiastical prisons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">April 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength, because of thine enemies; that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 8:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Jesus rode on the ass into Jerusalem and went into the temple, the priests and scribes objected to the children crying out in the temple, Hosanna to the son of David I the Lord asked them: “Have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?” Similar circumstances have arisen in these times: The King has offered himself to Christendom and has come to his temple for judgment. The saints in the temple condition are crying as never before : “The kingdom is come. Hail to the King!” The giant-like ruling powers of this world object to the joyful acclamations of the new King. But again Jehovah has perfected praise out of the mouths of his little ones; he has ordained strength unto them to raise their voices and to proclaim his message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">April 21</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.—Proverbs 16:</span><span class="font3"> 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The thought is that Jehovah has made and reserves all things for their own due time. He holds the times and seasons within the unyielding grasp of his own hand. He could have imprisoned or destroyed the Devil at any time, but his Word discloses that it is Jehovah’s purpose to let the Evil One come to the full in his wicked course before he executes his final judgment against him. While he is doing this, the Lord permits others of his intelligent creatures either to follow the Devil in his wrongful course or to war against iniquity and follow righteousness and be classed as “the true”. The Lord’s people should therefore not fret because of those who prosper in their wicked ways. The day of evil for which Jehovah has reserved the wicked has come. Therefore his obedient ones should not hesitate to take the 'slaughter weapons’ and smite the wicked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.—Isaiah 51:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This means that Jehovah has commissioned the members of the church on earth to deliver the message of new heavens and a new earth. This is the real duty of each one. Lest he fear, Jehovah gives to him the full assurance that his divine power is shielding and protecting each one of the faithful ones. As we visualize the powers of evil, we can with certainty know that Satan would wipe out the members of the church instantly if God would permit him so to do. But those who are hid within the shadow of Jehovah’s hand occupy a position of absolute security. When his work is accomplished and the record is written up, then Jehovah will point to those of Zion, that all the peoples of the earth may know who they are; and to these favored ones he will say: “Thou art my people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">April 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The glory of the Lord shall endure for ever: the Lord shall rejoice in his works.—Psalm 101:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“His work is perfect.” When Jehovah had brought forth man in his image and had finished his preparatory work on earth, he beheld everything that he had made and rejoiced because it was good. When the work of sin-atonement is consummated and all things in heaven and in earth have been gathered together in one under Christ, Jehovah will rejoice again. Honor and glory shall then crown man once more to the praise of Jehovah . But the work in which he will rejoice most, will be the new creation, “the precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold.” Giving us what is only a faint conception of the joy he will have in them, he addresses Zion, whom they represent, saying, “As the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God' rejoice over thee.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">With long life will 1 satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.—Psalm 91:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These words seem strongly to indicate that Jehovah in due time will give full assurance to the faithful remnant while in the flesh that these have fought the good fight and have won the victory, and that death to them means but the beginning of eternal joy, even as he gave similar assurance to the Apostle Paul. These beautiful and consoling words of the prophet seem to apply fittingly to the feet members of the church, who dwell in the secret place of the Most High, giving to them an absolute and full assurance that deliverance is certain. What blessed assurance such words of Jehovah give to his people! Is it any wonder that those in the secret place desire to employ all their time and to put forth every effort to give a testimony to the name of the Almighty, even as he has commanded!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">April 25</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Blessed be the name of the Lord, from this time forth and for evermore.—Psalm 113:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This text is a prophecy that must have a fulfilment at some time. That due time is now here. The Prophet Isaiah said of Israel’s God: “Verily, thou art a God that hidest thyself.&quot; (Isaiah 45:15) But there must come a time when Jehovah makes his glorious name to be known to the world as he made it known unto Egypt. From that time forward there will be no uncertainty as to who is the Almighty God. Then men must give him the honor due his name if they would live. The feet members of the Anointed One begin to make known his glorious name in the earth, and from that time for-word his name is magnified amongst men. The Servant class also see that there is now a definite work to be done from this time forth. Great are the privileges enjoyed by the faithful saints from this time and for evermore. These now declare and will continue to sing forth the praises of his glorious name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">She brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.—Rev. 12:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Jehovah anointed Lucifer as the covering cherub to safeguard Adam and Eve, he began his organization with respect to mankind. But Satan plied his arts of temptation against the human pair and, like a dragon, swallowed them up within his power. Subsequently Jehovah organized Israel as his nation, but Satan eventually overreached that organization. Still later Jehovah began the true church. Apostates went out from the church and developed the ecclesiastical organization of Christendom; and Satan, the great Dragon, devoured them. In 1914 A. D., Zion, Jehovah’s true organization, gave birth to the ruling factor of the new world. Praise Jehovah that he has delivered it, the man child, from the voracious jaws and power of the Dragon, Satan, and has enthroned it securely in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">April 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, the stone that I have laid before Joshua: upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the Lord of hosts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Zechariah 3: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In substance, Jehovah is here saying to the anointed class: ‘I have laid before you one Stone, which is my anointed King. Upon him shines the full and complete light of my plan. From time to time flashes of light from this Stone shall come to those who are of the temple class. Greater light is coming day after day. Every stone of the temple must now be engraved with the likeness of this perfect Corner Stone. He is the Plumb-Stone, and now is the time of judgment, and by him all the stones must be measured.’ This greater light that comes to the anointed class brings to them an ever-increasing joy. It becomes as the light of the noonday. Those who reject the light dash their foot against The Stone, but those who see the vision and who love the Lord seek to put forth all diligence to be faithful and to avoid stumbling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">April 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.—Psalm 44: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Only in the strength of Jehovah shall anyone do valiantly. He it is that shall really tread down his and oui enemies in the battle of Armageddon. Armageddon will mark the use of God’s wine-press for treading out the life-blood of the “vine of the earth” and its ripe grapes of wickedness. In just what manner Jehovah will do the treading is not yet revealed, but certain it is that the Lord himself will do the crushing. What part then in that great work is to be performed by the Lord’s remnant, yet on earth? God’s Word makes it clear that their part is to declare the day of God’s vengeance; to be witnesses that he is God; to sing forth his praises; to be unreservedly and whole-heartedly on his side; and to hold forth his standard for the people, that they may know which way to go. This the remnant does by constantly participating in the Lord’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">April 29</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God giveth to a man that is good in his sight, wisdom, and knowledge, and joy.—Ecclesiastes 2:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“There is one good, that is, God,” said Jesus. Jehovah God is goodness personified. Logically then his will and his commandments must be good. Hence those who are whole-heartedly devoted to Jehovah and who from sincere hearts are striving to do his will and keep his commandments are good in the eyes of the Lord; they are engaged in doing good. Of course, their works are imperfect; but their hearts are perfect toward Jehovah as they busy themselves in that which is good in his sight. All others are classed as workers of iniquity and have Jehovah’s disapproval. To those who are good according to his standard Jehovah gives three essentials to their proper performance of his service: He gives them a knowledge of his good and holy will through his Word; he answers their prayers for wisdom as to how to perform; and he refreshes them with joy, which makes them strong in his service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: luild thou the walls of Jerusalem.—Psalm 51:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The rebuilding of the walls round about Jerusalem by Nehemiah foreshadowed the work of the church in restoring and proclaiming the truth for a purpose. It seems specially to represent the work of the church from </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">after 1918. It is in reality, however, Jehovah who </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font3">his good pleasure builds the walls, because it is in his strength and by virtue of his favor and protection that the work is accomplished. A wall represents a protection to those inside. Therefore the holding forth of the truth, as foreshadowed by the rebuilding of the walls, serves as a protection to God’s people in Zion; also as a testimony that God has a people in the earth, a testimony that vindicates the honor and dignity of God, a testimony that the present evil order is of Satan and must fall, and a testimony that Jehovah will have the victory and set up his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">May 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord looseth the prisoners.—Psalm 146:7</span><span class="font3"> 7.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark277"></a><span class="font3">The Lord loves these prisoners despite the fact that their rebellion against the Most High and their slighting of the counsel of their true Friend, Jehovah, have brought them into the solitude of prison life in mystic Babylon. He is moved by their groanings and cries for deliverance. He can force open the prison doors and release them. Even now he is sending messages of truth and deliverance through the very walls and doors of the prison by means of the all-penetrating radio waves. It is the advance notice of approaching deliverance. Jehovah has anointed and preserved his servants, his elect, unto this time “to proclaim ... the opening of the prison to them that are bound”. Let us then manifest our obedience to Jehovah and our love for our imprisoned spiritual brethren by hastening unto them with God’s message and bidding them to “go forth” and show themselves, unashamed, on the Lord’s side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">May 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">From the rising of the sun, unto the going down Of the same, the Lord’s name is to he praised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 113:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This text does not mean daily worship as the sun rises and goes down. The sun rises in the east and sets in the west, and from east to west is every place on earth. The text therefore means that everywhere the sun shines shall the ^Lord’s name be praised. This conclusion is corroborated by other prophets. It means that the time must come when there is a worship of Jehovah by men all over the earth and by all who live. The prophet thus had a vision of the praises of Jehovah sounding from the hearts of all people long held in bondage. It is a song of deliverance. The feet members of Christ begin the glad song before they leave the earth. Together they declare the message with joy. The fact that the faithful Servant class is now doing that very thing is proof that we are entering the time when from henceforth the honor of God’s name shall be declared in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">May 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant.—Malachi 3:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The promise was that Jehovah would send a deputy to act for him. The coming of the “Adonai”, the Messenger of the Abrahamie Covenant, to the temple class is not an imaginary thing; it is a fact, positively and emphatically stated in the Scriptures, and fully corroborated by the physical facts since 1918. Jehovah states that his Messenger will prepare “the way” before him. A way means a course to be pursued or a mode of action; and here it clearly seems to mean “the way” which Jehovah has prepared for men to get life, whether upon the spirit plane or the human plane. The preparing of the way must refer first to the preparation of the church since 1874, and later to the way for all the people who will come into harmony with God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">May 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Except the Lord, build the house, they labour in vain that build it; except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.—Psalm 127:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is Jehovah that builds the house; otherwise the efforts of all those laboring in God’s cause would be vainly spent. The time has now come for him to build the house, the temple, both by resurrecting the sleeping saints and by further preparing the temple stones which are still in the quarries of earth. The time having come for the work, the temple must be reared; and it is being reared. The Lord has come to his temple class, and those who refuse to conform to his plan of work or who in self-conceit choose to work independently of his organization are cleared out. Happy are they who think soberly. They realize that they are not necessary, but that the Lord has favored them with an opportunity to serve in his cause and by this course to prove their fealty, obedience and loving devotion to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">May 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts.—Haggai 2:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the Lord of hosts.” This is a promise that the glory with which Jehovah will fill the heavenly temple shall far outshine the glory of the typical temples, not even excluding Solomon’s temple, which is estimated to have cost eighty-seven thousand million dollars or more. What a transporting prospect of glory, honor, and immortality rises before the church’s vision! How it spurs her on to patient continuance in the Lord’s service! The present shaking of the nations simply assures her that the glorification is nigh at hand. Even now the glory of the Lord has risen upon his temple class in the earth. It stands effulgent with the glorious light of the kingdom message, streaming from it to the peoples in darkness. &quot;Happy Zion, what </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">favored lot is thine!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">May 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">0 let the nations he glad, and sing for joy; for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth.—Psalm 67:</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah will be the Governor. The dominion, the rule or power of the kingdom, will reside in him. To govern means not only to rule but primarily to guide and thus to control. All this Jehovah will do. He will open the highway to life, and use The Christ as the faithful Guide to direct mankind’s steps in the way of holiness that they might ascend the highway and unerringly reach the glorious goal, life eternal. Throughout all their wayfaring up this highway to life, they shall receive righteous judgment and shall learn righteousness at the hands of him whom Jehovah has ordained to judge the world in righteousness. This hope should be cause for unbounded joy on the part of the people. Let us create this hope in their hearts by telling them the Lord’s message that their joy may begin now, and that they may sing unto the Lord for gladness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">May 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">In the dispensation of the fulness of times, he might gather together in one all things in Christ, hath which are in heaven, and which are on earth;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">even in him.—Ephesians 1:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s plan, as revealed to man, is that God has appointed his beloved Son to be King; that he has made him the chief corner and foundation of his organization Zion; that in due time he is presented as earth’s rightful </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font3">g; that although rejected by all, God completely establishes his organization, which brings righteousness to the earth; that when the work of restoration of man is completed, every creature who is obedient to God will be granted everlasting life and will joyfully support and render homage to the great King. When Jehovah’s plan is fully accomplished and all creatures in heaven and in earth are gathered under one Head, Christ Jesus, and all are through him subject to the Father, then all things will be to the glory of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.—Psalm 45:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For many centuries Satan and his angels have constituted the heavens of the evil world, and mankind organized into forms of government under Satan’s lordship have constituted the earth. Satan’s earthly princelings have comprised the commercial, political and ecclesiastical elements. Though already deposed from their former heavenly position, Satan and his angels still exercise their influence as heavenly powers over mankind. But preparations are now moving rapidly forward for the great and final conflict, in which the old world will be utterly destroyed and new heavens and a new earth be established. In the new earth Jehovah’s appointment is that all the martyrs, of whom Satan’s world was not worthy, the faithful ones from Abel to John the Baptist, shall be the princes. They shall be children of The Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">May 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Let them praise the name of the Lord: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.—Psalm 118:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Here the Psalmist calls upon all created things to praise the excellency of Jehovah’s name. It is the time when all the works of Jehovah will praise him and all the saints will bless his name. Harmony with Jehovah means oneness with the divine will. God’s promises guarantee that every one will have a full opportunity to come into harmony with him and therefore to enter the way of life. With every opposing power broken down, all will have an opportunity to share in bringing praises </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">his holy name. His glory then will be set indeed high above heaven and earth. The present favor of the anointed Servant class is to begin the song of praise to his name which shall never cease. To these faithful ones the service of Jehovah and his Christ becomes more precious every day. The opportunity is now open for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">every </span><span class="font3">one of the anointed to have some part in this glorious work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Not by works of righteousness which we have done, hut according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy spirit.—Titus 3:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our own righteousnesses are but as filthy rags; they are not fit as a covering for our naturally undone condition before the eyes of Jehovah. By our own works we can never be justified in his sight. Jehovah well understood this; and in his mercy he provided for our salvation from death. He arranged for us to be washed in the blood of his dear Son that thus we might be presented before him as regenerated human beings deserving of the right to live on earth. But over and above this mercy Jehovah has shown us greater favor by accepting us for sacrifice with Jesus and begetting us by his spirit and in this manner renewing us, making us new creatures in Christ. How could we keep silent in view of such grace?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">May 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you.—1 Thessalonians 3:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah sheds abroad his love into our hearts by his spirit, which he imparts to us. The more we have of his spirit the more we increase in love of the brethren. This will mean that we will unselfishly consider the interest of our brethren. Knowing that they also have made a covenant with the Lord by sacrifice, we will be anxious to see them perform their part of the covenant, that they too may have an entrance into the kingdom. We will earnestly beseech out brethren to render their “reasonable service” unto the Lord. (Romans 13:1) We will not be anxious to enjoy some honor at the expense of our brethren, but will rather ‘in honor prefer one another’. There will exist a real family feeling as becomes members of the household of God; and as such we shall fight shoulder to shoulder, safeguarding each other’s interests, “fighting for [our] brethren,” and always contending for the gospel of Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Blessed be the Lord my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight.—Psalm 144:1.</span><span class="font3">The hand is a symbol of active power. Jehovah has placed certain powers, duties, and obligations in the hands of his people; hence there is a responsibility upon them to use the same. There is no allowance for slacking the hand, or for failing to use our smallest powers, as pictured by the fingers, in the conflict now raging. The Lord has given his “young men” who are endowed with vision, a searching insight into the Devil’s organization. He has earnestly warned them of the maliciousness of the Dragon, the Devil, who now wars against those who keep Jehovah’s commandments. The war is on; the Lord is pressing the battle to the gates of the enemy. Those of the Lord’s army </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font3"> fight; the enemy must not be spared. No consecrated Christian can afford to yield to fear and withdraw from the active front.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">May 13</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another, according to Christ Jesus.—Romans 15:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah is a God of patience. During all the centuries during which reproaches have been cast upon him and his he has borne up forbearingly. He has steadfastly and zealously pursued his holy and righteous plans, allotting sufficient time for all his good purposes to ripen. He is now granting time to his remnant on earth to display the like calibre of mind, patience, in his service. Patience means constancy in the performance of duty, enduring hardship as a good soldier, and doing so with inward joy, knowing that a right course is being pursued which is pleasing to God. The faithful Christian never becomes impatient with serving the Lord by trying to run ahead of the Lord or by quitting the service because his expectations are not realized when he wants them. He is certain that Jehovah is not unfaithful to forget what he is doing, but will keep his every promise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">0 send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.—Psalm 43:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since the Lord came to his temple there have been flashes of lightning; that is to say, intermittent illuminations of the Word of God, giving further glimpses of truth in his great plan. These flashes of light do not emanate from any member of the temple class, but from the Lord. It is Jehovah who is sending out </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font3"> light and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font3"> truth, and at the critical time for the church. The church had expected to go home in 1914, and her soul was inclined to be cast down and disquieted within her. She was temporarily puzzled as to why the Lord stopped the war and left her still on earth. Responding to her prayer for leading, Jehovah has indeed sent out the needed light and truth to show which is the way unto his holy hill of Zion, the heavenly kingdom. And now, praising Jehovah, her exceeding joy, on the harp, she joyfully goes to his altar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">May 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The works of his hands are verity and judgment: all his commandments are sure.—Psalm 111:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The hands of Jehovah are always busied with truth and judgment. His works, which will accomplish the redemption of mankind and the deliverance of the church, are verity; that is, they are in full harmony with, and in fulfilment of, his Word, which is truth. He backs up his truth with works so that his Word comes true and does not return unto him void. Surely as we scan all his works in our behalf we can testify: “There hath not failed one word of all his good promise.” Additionally, all his works are judgment; that is, they are in absolute accord with Jehovah’s sound judgment and they never err or diverge from strict righteousness. “The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.” Summing up the consistent testimony of Jehovah’s works we can say: “Holy and reverend is his name.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Praise the Lord, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">is exalted.—Isaiah 12:</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The day of the Lord” is now here! The anointed have a specific work to do. The marginal reading of this text shows that these shall now call upon each other to praise Jehovah by proclaiming his name. This they do by bearing witness to the name and glory of Jehovah when they tell the people of his plan and that his name is now to be exalted. These anointed ones are the only people who can tell what Jehovah is now doing in the earth. They are the only ones who know that his name is now set up. They voice his praises by telling the people that God’s kingdom is now set up because he has set his King upon his holy throne. It does not seem that any one of the anointed could now prove faithful who fails or refuses to embrace opportunities to tell out the message of truth. God has provided the means for every one to have some part in this favored work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">May 17</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.—Psalm 121: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All who are in Christ Jesus and who diligently strive to keep themselves in the love of God, who with all their keeping keep their hearts pure, who trust in the Lord with all their heart and lean not to their own understanding, who in all their ways acknowledge him, these he will keep. All the po-wers of the evil one and his agencies cannot separate them from the love of God and cannot pluck them out of his hand. Slumbering never, he is not off guard for a moment. What a great God we have! What an invulnerable fortress! Here we may dwell in peace, confident that as long as we strive to do our part in keeping our covenant by sacrifice and rendering our reasonable service we are sure of Jehovah’s favor and keeping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.—Psalm 118:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This is the day when the Chief Corner Stone is completely laid; namely, the time when God sets his Beloved upon his throne and offers him as earth’s King. It is the day that the great King is finally rejected by those who have claimed to walk in his name, but he becomes the Head and Chief Corner Stone. It is the day in which some are falling upon that Stone and are being broken, while others are being ground to powder by the Stone which has fallen upon them. The Lord has come to his temple and has invited the faithful to enter into his joy. To these he gives greater light and shows them the wonderful privilege of being witnesses in his name. It is the day in which the message of truth is being proclaimed with boldness and in which the Lord holds back the evil powers until the testimony is finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">May 19</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy; to deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.—Psalm 33:18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This statement of truth was written by one of God’s people who had only earthly hopes. What a blessed word of consolation it is for us to pass along to those engulfed in the present distress of the world! Mourning fills the earth; and in their trepidation many who are meek and many who are poor know not which way they may turn or what they may do and on whom they may hope and why. To them God seems to have covered himself with a cloud that their prayers might not pass through. It is our noble privilege to assure them that Jehovah is gracious; that he wifi consider them favorably who reverence him, and that such may hope in his mercy through the time of trouble. It may be that amid the destructions of Armageddon he will deliver their soul from death and spare them to be among those millions now living who will never die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Teach me io</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> d&lt;&gt; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">thy will; 'for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 113:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Each one who has Jehovah as his God, and who has his good spirit, the spirit of love, abiding in him, delights to do the will of God and to keep his commandments. He will pray that his heavenly Father will teach him his will that he may do it joyfully. True to faith, the Lord is leading his teachable ones in the course of uprightness; he is not leaving them to the mercies of misleading teachers. He leaves no ambiguity or uncertainty about his commands laid upon his people today. He has given them a clearer vision of his purposes and made clearer his will. Obedience thereto is now imperative. The responsibility attaching to the office of the anointed cannot be evaded by any kind of reasoning or sophistry. Each anointed one is being put to the test.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">May 21</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that 1 should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: ... he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.—Isaiah 50:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our vocal powers, our powers of expressing thought to others, are gifts from Jehovah. In view of having consecrated our all to him, it is eminently proper that we use these powers to glorify Jehovah. Hsing our tongues slanderously, or in backbiting and gossiping, is not in harmony with our consecration. It is dishonoring to the Lord and not in accord with the learning which he has given us through his Word. He has made us responsible for our tongues, because the tongue’s power can be used either for or against the kingdom interests. He has wakened our ears to the kingdom message and has made us learned in the things of the kingdom. For what purpose? That we might use our tongues and other powers in comforting all that mourn and in strengthening the brethren who might be growing weary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof: and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old.—Amos 9:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The tabernacle of David symbolizes the reigning house of David. Jehovah chose it to be the royal line. In 606 B. C., the reigning house of David fell; its tabernacle collapsed when Jehovah overturned the kingdom. But Jehovah had promised that a man should never fail from the throne of David. With the coming of Jesus, who was of the line of David, and with his anointing as the Messiah, Jehovah gave to him the right to the kingdom; and there he began to restore and raise up the fallen tabernacle of David. Throughout the Christian era Jehovah has been in process of raising it up by the selection of the body members of The Christ, who should reign with Jesus. In 1914 Jehovah established the throne in mercy; and the King now sits upon it in the tabernacle of David, judging.—Isaiah 16: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">May 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Whither the tribes go up, . . . to give thanks unto the name of the Lord.—Psalm 122:</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Three times each year the tribes of Israel went up to Jerusalem. Their going was not so much to make requests of Jehovah but to proclaim his praises and recount his goodness to them. God has now set Zion as the place where he will accept praise from his faithful ones, and in no other place does he accept praise and service. God’s organization on earth is a part of Zion, which is made up of that faithful company of anointed ones who joyfully obey his commandments to do his will. As surely as God made Jerusalem the place or center of worship, just so surely now he has made his visible organization on earth the place where he accepts the praise and service of his people. His anointed ones associate themselves together in what we call the Society to do the work of Jehovah as he has commanded and thereby proclaim the honor of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.—Isaiah 40:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Jehovah, the Creator of the ends of the earth, faint-eth not, neither is weary.” In him is everlasting strength. His work goes on unceasingly. The afflictions of the World War had made the church faint and they seemed no longer to have might. Then Jehovah gave power and strength to them that they might keep on in his service and finish the work he has given us to do. Youths may faint and grow weary despite their physical vigor, and the young men may utterly fail, and no one can rely on the strength of arm. “But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles.” Jehovah never proves unreliable. In him alone can we truly be strong.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. . . . And the Lord spaice unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.—Jonah 1:17; 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah is able to take care of any contingency in order that the witness to his name shall be given. He is able to preserve his witnesses in a most miraculous manner, that the work assigned to them might be carried out. He is able to overrule also the disobedience of those who grow fearful or who doubt the Lord’s message and who shrink from exposing themselves as witnesses in a hostile world. Even the gates of hell cannot prevail against Jehovah’s true servants. The adversary schemed to bring about Jesus’ death; and when that One lay prone in the tomb Satan imagined that he had for ever silenced Jehovah’s greatest Witness. But in vain! On the third day Jehovah brought Jesus up out of the grave and showed him unto faithful disciples. These disciples he made his witnesses unto the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Of the people there was none with me; for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">in my fury.—Isaiah 63:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Jehovah says: “Of the people there was none with me,” it proves that no religious system on earth will be supporting Jehovah in his battle to overthrow the Devil’s organization; because the religious systems are now a part of that enemy organization. Christ Jesus will be Jehovah’s Chief Executive in treading the vine of the earth. Of all the people of earth who profess to be followers of Christ, none are in fact with him except those whom he counts as a part of himself, as his body members, because of their faithfulness. It follows that none now on earth, regardless of-what he may have heretofore done in the name of the Lord, can be counted in as a part of the Lord, The Christ, unless he is with the Lord, actively supporting him in the fight against Satan’s organization. He could not include any of those in present truth or other professed Christians who in any wise compromise with the Devil’s organization or sympathize with it. Are you in the Lord’s ranks ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">May 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof.—Psalm 97:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah reigns; for he has set his Anointed One, his Son, as King upon his holy hill of Zion. The Lord would have all the peoples of earth rejoice over this auspicious fact; especially would he have “the multitude of isles” rejoice, that is, the “great multitude” who shall yet wash their robes and make them white in the blood of the Lamb. But “clouds and darkness are round about him”, and the world is in the gloom of the greatest crisis of all time and complete collapse is approaching. What shall the Christian do whose eyes of faith perceive that the reign of the Lord has begun? Rejoice to himself? Ko; but let him point the people to the fact that Michael, the great Prince of Peace, has stood up and will bring to the people the desire of their hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I break in pieces the nations; and with thee will I destroy kingdoms.—Jer. 51:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus is the Head of Zion; and Jehovah will actually employ him as his war-club, as his great Executive, Melchizedek, in breaking to pieces and destroying the nations and kingdoms of Satan’s world system. The Lord’s followers, a remnant, this side the vail, do not use violent means in their warfare under Jehovah’s standard; nevertheless the Lord has given them a measure of “power [authority] over the nations”. He has furnished them with challenges, warnings, indictments, and testimonies embodied in resolutions to be circulated among the nations. These fall like a storm of hail upon rulers and ruled. While they do not break nations and kingdoms to pieces, yet we may hope that they serve to break up and destroy the faith and reliance of many of the governors as well as the governed upon the nations and kingdoms of Satan’s organization. What we cannot do Jehovah will do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">May 29</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Come, behold the works of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth. He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth.—Psalm 46:8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To the League of Nations or any human organization for the promotion of international peace will not go the credit of outlawing, abolishing and suppressing wars in the earth. To the Lord Jehovah alone will go the glory of this grand achievement. But first must come his fearful works of desolation in the earth. No power aside from Jehovah’s can now avert Armageddon, and he will not use his power to avert it. The Devil’s organization must fall to make way for the kingdom of righteousness; his war-machine must be desolated. Then, the Prince of Peace in charge and with the government resting upon his shoulder, there shall be an end of war but no end of peace. Then shall the people be led forth with peace, and they shall rejoice and be glad.—Isa. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">55:</span><span class="font3">12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved.—Acts 2:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This text has special reference to the troublesome times “in the notable day of the Lord”. The name of Jehovah must be made known to all men as it was made known to Moses in the day of trouble upon Egypt. Now the Lord is beginning to make the meaning of his name clear. Jehovah is seen to be the gracious God, the For-giver of transgressions, and the Way to life. Some of the people will pass through the great time of trouble. They must know the name of Jehovah. “Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved” out of the worst of the troubles. That is one of the reasons for the great witness to the truth now being given and which must continue to be given until God’s due time for something else to be done. Those in the secret place of the Most High have the protection of Jehovah while giving the witness to the honor of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">May 31</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined. —Psalm 50:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This prophecy is now in course of fulfilment. God has not shined out of nominal Christendom. On the contrary nominal Christendom has defamed his holy name, and pushed him into a corner, and made him appear in a bad light. But now the new government has been born from the womb of the morning, and has come forth with the dew or freshness of youth and vigor, and is shining to the glory of God. It is out of the true Zion that Jehovah is shining, because his organization is praising his holy name and is testifying that he is the true and only God. Never was such </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> privilege granted before to beings on earth. Now as never previously is the time for God’s saints on earth to let their light shine that men might see their good and faithful work of witnessing, and glorify God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Remember me, 0 my God, for good.—Nehemiah 13:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God remembers. He is not unrighteous to forget any work of love or service of faith. It is not inappropriate when we go to the Lord in prayer to ask him to remember some of the things that we have done to his praise, as did Nehemiah, especially when the enemy opposes and the way is fraught with difficulties, and when the best we can do is to leave our judgment with the Lord. Nehemiah prayed for service. He prayed that he might win favor in order to get to go to Jerusalem and rebuild the ruined walls. The members of the church now are building, and in bringing the truth to the people should pray for wider opportunities of service. God will remember them for what good they have done and in a good way.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark278"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">June 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Hany nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain, of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths.—Micah &nbsp;&nbsp;2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While Satan, the enemy of God and righteousness, still exercises his power over men, it is impossible to teach all people the truth. Only those who have a desire for a better and happier condition will heed the message. When Satan is restrained and shorn of his power to deceive the people, then the message of the truth will freely flow and be received with welcome by the millions of earth. Jehovah will use the great Prophet and Priest whose lips have kept knowledge, to teach the people his way of holiness; and the people shall seek the law at his mouth and speedily learn righteousness and walk in the paths that Jehovah has opened for them to attain life. At this time it is out privilege to carry the Lord’s message to the teachable ones of earth, that they may see in advance the way that Jehovah has prepared in their behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Hear, all ye people; hearken, 0 earth, and dll that therein is: and let the Lord God be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.—Micah 1:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has sent his Deputy, “the messenger of the covenant”; and now he sits upon his throne of judgment, in the temple, in the house of God. Those who are loyal in action as well as in heart abide the day of the Messenger’s coming, but all others are cleared out of the temple as they fall under the judgment tests. However, the Scriptures indicate that the judgment would extend to others than the spiritual “sons of Levi”; namely, to the people of nominal Christendom. Evidences prove that Christendom did not stand the test but completely repudiated Christ’s kingdom, and has been rejected by Jehovah. It follows that the time is come to let the people hear the judgment of the Lord. Appropriately the declaration of God’s vengeance is now proceeding out from or through his temple class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">June 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.—Isaiah 60:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The earth, will be the place of God’s sanctuary during the Millennium; for then it shall be said: “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.” Jehovah’s sanctuary or tabernacle is his great mediatorial body, The Christ, through whom mankind will have access to God and be reconciled to him. The presence of Jehovah’s sanctuary will make the earth the place of his feet, and there men shall worship at his footstool. He will therefore make the earth beautiful, glorifying it with Edenic beauties. The glory and grandeur of Lebanon’s forests of evergreen trees will be given unto it. All the willing and obedient of mankind shall be planted in the earth and grow up as everliving trees to the glory of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage ? He retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy.—Micah 7:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The blessings of Jehovah are poured out upon his creatures. They are bestowed so lavishly that they can be said to be multiplied. God is the fountain from which flow multiplied mercies, like the waters of a peaceful river. The center and channel of God’s mercy is Jesus. It is particularly made manifest during the Christian era toward those who make a covenant with him by sacrifice and diligently strive to keep that covenant. But in these days he has shown special mercy to the remnant of his heritage. He has passed by whatever may have been their transgressions during their trials of 1918 and 1919, and has mercifully favored them with the blessed Elisha work. All who will finally enter into the kingdom must imitate Jehovah as to showing mercy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">June 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.—Psalm 23:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah led the Israelites in the right path for his name’s sake. He will continue to lead his anointed Servant class in the path of righteousness for his name’s sake. He is the great Shepherd, and the sheep are blessed by his loving kindness. Jehovah remembers his covenant and that his honor is involved in the love and comfort and welfare of his sheep. He permits the enemy to attack them and threaten their destruction, but the faithful he will always lead in the right way and will fully deliver them. The precious promises bring confidence and consolation to the anointed in this hour of great testing. Those who love the Lord God delight to show their appreciation of his goodness. This they do by keeping his commandments joyfully. It is impossible now to keep the commandments without having some part in his service as opportunity is afforded. The honor of his name is now being sung by all who love him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">It shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions.—Joel 2:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pouring out means a libation, a gushing out or shedding forth. The spirit is the invisible power which Jehovah exercises toward his saints to accomplish his purposes. He pours it out on no one unless that one is willingly in heart harmony with God. He must have an honest, sincere desire to do God’s will. As at Pentecost, so since the coming of the Lord to his temple in 1918, Jehovah is not now limiting his spirit to a few; for we have reached the last days spoken of. The tremendous work of the Elisha class must be accomplished. Those who are “young men” in spirit and determination must “see visions” in order to be inspired onward. They need a “double portion” of the spirit of the Lord to make them bold and to energize them to do the great work that is to be done before the end comes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">June 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">If God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.—Romans 11: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Addressing Israel as the natural seed of Abraham before whom lay the opportunity to become the heavenly blessers of all the families of the earth, Jeremiah eaid: “The Lord called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly fruit.” After Pentecost only a remnant of the Jews retained their position as branches in this tree, which symbolizes heavenly kingdom blessings and opportunities. The vast majority of the tree’s natural branches were broken off at the close of the seventy symbolic weeks of exclusive favor to the Jews in A. D. 36. Jehovah spared them not because they failed to meet the test of faith and obedience. Let us therefore, who have been grafted into the olive tree, take heed to our ways. God is unchanged. The Lord is in his holy temple. The judgment is on. What we were and have done in the past does not count now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">For thy name’s sake, 0 Lord, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great.—Psalm 25:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The people of God have a place where they may find a covering for their sins. This is by and through the merit of Christ Jesus’ ransom sacrifice. The prayer of the Psalmist expressed in this text is really the prayer of the anointed ones. It is an appeal for help prompted by the highest motive. It is not a selfish prayer. If the wrongful act of the child of God might bring dishonor upon the name of his Father, then he is prompted by the highest motive when he asks for forgiveness to the end that God’s name might not suffer reproach because of his act. The child of God who takes this course shows that his great desire is to honor his Father’s name, and that he had rather sink into oblivion than to bring dishonor upon that holy name. For this reason he asks pardon at the throne of heavenly grace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">June 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the Lord’s—Obadiah 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Gentile kings have had their day, and now the kingdom over earth is the Lord’s. The mount of Esau represents the Devil’s organization, which is impregnated with the selfish spirit of Satan and the profane disposition of Esau to sell his birthright for the pottage that the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life craved. This organization, particularly its ecclesiastical element, is noted for its violence to the Lord’s true people; in the day of assault on God’s organization it stood on the other side. (Obadiah 10, 11) The judgment of the mount of Esau is at present in progress. Jehovah has set his Anointed One on his holy hill of Zion. He is the Savior of mankind. With him are the saints who slept, but who are now risen and acting in the capacity of saviors with him. On earth the saints who seek to ascend into the hill of the Lord are pronouncing God’s judgment against Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, 1 will gather them out of all countries whither 1 have driven them in mine anger, . . . and 1 will bring them again unto this place, and 1 will cause them to dwell safely.—Jer. 32:37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Behold Jehovah now bringing his Word to pass and gathering the Jews at the rate of thousands monthly to Palestine! In consequence of their iniquity in rejecting the divine Word and also him of whom that Word testified, Jehovah’s anger dispersed them far and wide among the Gentiles, and debarred them from residence in their beloved land. But their warfare and their appointed time were accomplished by 1878 A. D. By then Israel’s double of disfavor from the Lord ended. Now they are to be planted anew in the land, never to be uprooted again but to dwell safely. These facts mark the present as the time to speak comfortably unto Jerusalem. Wherefore, thou that bringest good tidings unto Jerusalem, “lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">June 12</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy; the king of Israel, even the Lord, is in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more.—Zephaniah 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah hath taken away the church’s judgment, having clothed her with the robe of righteousness in manifestation of his approval. He hath cast out of heaven her great enemy, the accuser of the brethren; and he himself, as represented in his Messenger who has come to his temple, is amongst his people. Special protection from evil is promised to them while engaged in his work. The enemy, though cast out, is not yet bound. He is desperately fighting to maintain his empire, but the victorious Lord is majestically marching against him. Behold the “Faithful and True” leading his army to certain victory! Ye soldiers of the cross, yield not to the seductive wiles of the Devil. With armor girded on and with the sword of the spirit, march on to certain triumph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the name of the Lord. —Psalm 135:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The expression, “Praise ye the Lord,” means the same thing as Hallelujah. It also arises from a heart filled with gratitude to Jehovah for his goodness, from the joy of knowing him, and for the privilege of serving him. This text is a call by the members of the temple class to others of the same class to adore and magnify the name of Jehovah. Much of the goodness of God is manifested toward his people by giving them the privilege of being coworkers with him. God's precious promises to the church are chiefly for the future; but the joy of the Lord, into which the Servant class is now invited, is for the time present. There never were such opportunities of serving the Lord as now. Those who are now faithfully serving him in obedience to his commands cannot keep back the song of praise, but are anxious to honor his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">June 14</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke.—Isaiah 59:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The accoutrements of Jehovah as he wages a victorious warfare against the adversary and his forces picture those qualities which identify and distinguish Jehovah in battle. He presents a clean or righteous breast to the eyes of all; he has righteous motives and causes for carrying out his destructive program against Satan’s organization. He has in mind the salvation of his remnant and all those for whom his Son died. He comes arrayed in the capacity of an Avenger: the day of vengeance is in his heart. Zeal as a cloke marks him in all his activities. All those who take their stand on the Lord’s side should take their clue from this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1 the. Lord will he their God, and my servant David a prince among them; I the Lord have spoken it. And</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1 will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil h easts to cease out of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the land.—Ezekiel 34: 24, 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The time will come when Jehovah will establish peace amongst all the peoples of earth who will trust him. He made a covenant with the Israelites at Mount Sinai, and in that covenant he promised to keep them in safety and in peace. He said: “And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.” The Israelites violated that covenant; but God will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, through David, his beloved One, the Prince of Peace. Israel and all mankind shall turn to Jehovah as their God, and he in turn will bless them. He will rid the earth of all that have ravaged and preyed upon the human race; and even the beasts shall be at peace among themselves and with man. Glad times are indeed coming for the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">June 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.—Isaiah 40:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Wilderness means a wild or neglected place, a desert. It describes the wild or deserted place of the world; for the clergy and the principal men of the flock have permitted the truth to be so obscured that Christendom has become a desert place. The word voice is a symbol of a message. It is the voice of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">him;</span><span class="font3"> that is, the message of Jehovah. The wilderness is the place where the prophecy shows that it cries. Since the world has been made a wilderness, the time has come when those who are associated with the Lord must, as his voice, cry forth in the wilderness the message of truth that has been placed in their possession for that purpose. The message is for mankind to prepare to receive the King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">For the Lord shall rise up as in Mount Perazim, he shall he wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act. — Isaiah 28:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The memories of Mount Perazim and the valley of Gibeon glorify the Lord. There the Lord, got glory for his name. How? By visibly displaying his power to conquer his enemies, and by openly espousing the cause of his people and protecting them and giving them victory in the conflict. The record is that Jehovah fought for Israel. Once again Jehovah will rise up in behalf of his cause and his elect ones, and will manifest his just wrath against the enemies of the kingdom of his dear Son. His glory will now be established in all the earth by visiting the multitude of his enemies and shielding and delivering his faithful remnant. To those who pin their faith to the Devil's organization it will be a strange act and work. “Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: . . . but let the righteous be glad.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">June 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us.—Psalm 67: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When the new heavens have full control of the situation in the earth without the interference of Satan’s organization, then the earth shall yield her fruit abundantly and blossom like the garden of Eden. Then the people will be illuminated with the knowledge of the truth and come to know Jehovah; then they will respond to the Scripture admonition, “Let all the people praise thee, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">0 </span><span class="font3">God.” They will say, Jehovah is God, even our own God; and Jehovah will say, It is my people. The new heavens, The Christ, will hear the new earth; and Jehovah will hear the new heavens, and through them he will shower his blessings upon mankind. The harvests of earth’s crops shall be increased so greatly that the reaping thereof will extend up to plowing time; seedsowing time will arrive before the treading of the abundance of grapes is completed.—Amos 9:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me. — Psalm 119:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This expresses the prayer of the &quot;great multitude” in the denominational cells of that great prison-house, ecclesiasticism. Their hearts are being brought low. Their prison rations are poor and unsatisfying to those who are consecrated and spirit-begotten. They long for liberty to learn more of the knowledge of Jehovah and his plan that thus they might freely praise the Lord. They have been disobedient children; and their tears of disappointment shall yet flow profusely over their loss of membership in the body of the Anointed One, The Christ. But Jehovah will deal bountifully with them and bring them out of the prison, wiping away their tears and leading them to the springs of the water of truth. Those righteous in Christ Jesus should hear the prisoners’ cries and compass them about with God’s message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">June 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Help us, 0 God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name; and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name’s sake.—Psalm 79:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those who keep the commandments of God and have the witness that they are the Lord’s are now targets for the assaults of the adversary. Sometimes the battle is pressed hard, and God does not at once reveal how he will deliver his people. Their discomfort may be because of some negligence, failure or refusal in the performance of duty. They plead for cleansing from all defilement. This they ask not so much for their own sakes but because the honor of God’s name is involved. The faithful Servant class is always more deeply concerned about the honor of Jehovah’s name than in gaining something for themselves. They would rather die than dishonor the Father’s name. They would die for the glory of his name. Such strive to bring honor to his name by availing themselves of all opportunities to testify to his great and loving plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, 1 will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Isaiah 49:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah is today signaling with his hand of power to the Gentiles. The standard that he has set up is the message of life that his “servant” class is bringing to the people. Has not the slogan for the past few years been “Millions now living will never die”? A great many who have heard this message have manifested the keenest interest in the message and expressed their desire to see the kingdom established. These may with propriety be designated as children of Jehovah’s “servant”, inasmuch as the Head of the “servant” class is Jesus “The everlasting Father”, and the saints this side the vail are bringing to them the message of life, that is to say, the message that shall lead them to receive life. Many of these are rejoicing in the truth and are expressing this joy in their own way, as pictured by bearing children up in their arms and on their shoulders.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall trust in it.—Isaiah 14:32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When we consider Zion, and that no enchantment or divination can avail against her and every weapon formed against her shall prove futile, can we not say in the language of the prophet: “What hath God wrought!” Centuries ago at the baptism and anointing of his obedient Son, Jesus, Jehovah brought forth the foundation Stone thereof; and after he had tested out his preciousness and sureness he laid him in Zion. Now the holy city rises in new national glory on her sure foundation. Some in trepidation may ask: “If the foundations [of Christendom] be destroyed, what can the righteous do ?” But the messengers of the new nation can respond: Jehovah hath founded Zion. The poor in spirit may trust in it and betake themselves to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thou art my King, 0 God: command deliverances for Jacob.—Psalm</span><span class="font3"> 44-4-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is not our rightful province to dictate to the Lord as to when shall come deliverance. Jehovah has marked his own times in his plan, and our times are in his hands, and it is best that so it is. Forbid then that we should presume either to get ahead of Jehovah or to let the acceptable time of the Lord slip by without availing ourselves of our opportunities as his witnesses. Jehovah is our King, and he commands when deliverance shall come for his elect ones. Happy is our lot to be his subjects, living in this thrilling time. For even now are we compassed about with songs of deliverance; and we see fulfilling the prophecies presaging that our deliverance, to wit, the redemption of our body, draweth nigh. Shortly Jehovah will arise for our help and command deliverance for us; and, freed from earthly evils for ever, we shall enter his temple above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">June 24</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I will plant in the wilderness the cedar,</span><span class="font3"> ... 7 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">will set in the desert the fir tree, . . . that they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the Lord hath done this.—Isaiah 11:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Who is so blind but that he can already see the fulfilment of this prophecy of the Lord beginning? Turn your eyes eastward to the holy land, and behold the irrigation schemes that the repatriated Jews are conducting in a land that has lain barren for centuries, laden with malaria and trachoma! See the zealous Zionists, being given the worst of lands, draining swamps, watering sand dunes and converting them into gardens and farmlands! See them planting trees by the millions in the waste lands, and majestic forests beginning to rear their heads! God’s hand has caused it to come to pass in this the due time that all, whether Christian, Jew or Gentile, might see, know, consider and understand that Jehovah is receiving the Jew to favor again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Be glad them, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God: for he hath given you the former rain according to righteousness, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month.—Joel 2:23, margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The early rain is to sprout the seeds, and the latter rain to mature the grain in the ear. From the time of our Lord’s parousia, and during the period of preparation, was a time of the early rain. That was a time of refreshing, because Jehovah turned his face to his people. It was a time of gathering together God’s people, and this work was done generally prior to 1918. Then followed a period of expectation and impatient waiting until the completion of the work. Unexpectedly the evidence was given that the Lord came to his temple in 1918. That was the time of the latter rain, which greatly revived the saints. During the latter rain is performed the Elisha work. Ye workers, haste along with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">June 26</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah.—Jeremiah 31:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The breaking of bread and the drinking of wine the night before our Lord’s death by the Lord and his disciples was the commencement of the new law covenant. This new covenant will bring life to the obedient ones of Israel and to all mankind. The blood as a basis for the covenant was shed on earth, or in the world, which was pictured by Egypt, at the time that Jesus died upon the cross. There God’s true Lamb was slain. The new covenant will be inaugurated in heaven. The outcome of it will be to release mankind from bondage and to regenerate and give life to all who will be obedient to its terms. The inauguration of this blessed arrangement is nigh at hand. Let all those who would be “able ministers of the new covenant” announce the fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Nevertheless, he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 106:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Israelites cried out because of oppression upon them by their taskmasters. Jehovah heard their dries. He saved Israel, not because they deserved to be saved but because he had made them his people. He would not turn a deaf ear to the suffering of his people and permit them to be destroyed. The anointed Servant class constitutes God’s people now on the earth. In themselves they cannot measure up to complete righteousness. Their honest endeavor is to glorify God. They are faithful in the performance of duty. God will not permit his people to be destroyed by those who oppose them and therefore oppose him. His great name is at stake. Even the great company or tribulation class he will save in his own good way. The faithful ones who delight now to sing forth the honor of his name have full assurance that God will protect them and deliver them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">June 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God . . . hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth; and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation.—Acts 17:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Long ago Jehovah covenanted to bless all nations of earth in Abraham’s seed, The Christ. While the nations were yet sinners, God commended his love to them in that his Son Jesus died for them. He determined beforehand as to the time when the miserable times of Gentile supremacy over the nations should terminate. In arranging for all nations to have a common blood stream by all being descendants of the first Adam, we observe Jehovah’s far-sighted policy of economy in his scheme for human salvation. Tor as in Adam all peoples that descend from him die, so all these peoples shall be made alive through one sacrifice. In view of this provision for them Jehovah has decreed that the gospel of the kingdom shall be preached to all nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out the prisoners into prosperity.—Psalm 68: 6, A. B. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The “great multitude”, with soiled robes, have now gone into a solitary place. Like the scapegoat of old, unclean and bearing iniquity, they have been led there by the hand of the clergy of Christendom since 1918. They are in spiritual prisons, bound and held there in restraint. God in his mercy is now beginning to bring these solitary ones into a condition of fellowship with the true household of faith. He is setting these spirit-begotten ones in families, separate and distinct from the others who compose the prison system, by getting through to them the riches of the present truth, the message of the kingdom. Thus he is bringing these prisoners out into prosperity, while the rebellious ones of ecclesiasticism are left in the “parched land” where the waters of truth do not flow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">June 30</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bor he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the Lord behold the earth;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">to hear the groaning of the prisoner, to loose those that are appointed to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 102:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah condescends to look down and consider the affairs of earth. One of his special considerations at this time is the interests of a “great multitude” of his spirit-begotten children. They are imprisoned by the ecclesiastical servants of the great gaoler or prison warden, the Devil. Dp to this hour this great prisonkeeper “did not let his prisoners loose homeward” (Isa. 14:17, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">margin) ;</span><span class="font3"> and now Jehovah purposes to intervene in their behalf. But they have made a covenant with Jehovah; they have been justified and accepted and begotten by his spirit; therefore they are appointed to death that their spirits might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. Their groanings have come up to the ears of God their Father; and now he sends his anointed ones to proclaim the opening of the prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He hath founded the earth upon her loses [margin], that it should not be removed for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 104:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah thus gives a foundation for the hope that the earth shall abide for ever; through the everlasting future it shall revolve on its axis and traverse its yearly orbit with faithfulness and obedience to its Creator; it shall be the beautiful home of restored mankind. Therefore human creatures and all that live and move and exist on earth may be glad. “Praise the Lord from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps: fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his word: mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars: beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl: kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth: both young men and maidens; old men and children : let them praise the name of the Lord.”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark279"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">July 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.—Psalm 103:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A throne is a symbol of sovereign power and authority. It signifies that he who possesses the throne has original jurisdiction and supreme power, absolute authority; and that there is none above him, but that he exercises power and authority without limitation. Where Jehovah has prepared or set up his regal seat is in the celestial universe. The stellar group, known as the constellation of Pleiades, situated in the north, seems to be marked by the Bible as the center of the celestial universe, the place of the throne of Jehovah, from which supreme authority is exercised. From this place of sovereign authority established in heaven above us Jehovah directs all things of the depthless heaven. Prom there he will in due time direct all things of the earth through The Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man, that he may bring forth food out of the earth.—Psalm 104:14</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All God’s works bespeak his manifold wisdom and his love. He carpets the earth with green grass, not only for beauty’s eye but in behalf of the grazing animals; he makes the ground to teem with forms of plant life, not merely to delight the sensibilities of man but also for man’s service and for his daily food. From all this Jesus drew a wholesome lesson for us, saying, “If God so clothe the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you?” How wretched that men should yield mentally to teachings that Jehovah is a God of hate and eternal torment, and that they should overlook the lesson of his love which he teaches even in his provision in nature for beast as well as man! Oh, let us hold aloft the standard that “God is love”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">July 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">But 1 had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went.—Ezekiel 36:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah had put his name upon Israel and made that people his representatives in the earth. Because of their unfaithfulness and wilful wrong-doing in taking their own selfish way they brought injury to the name of God amongst the nations round about. God therefore had pity on his holy name and took action accordingly. That foreshadowed what organized Christianity has done; to wit, brought injury to the name of Jehovah and made Christianity a stench in the nostrils of honest people. God therefore takes pity on his name now and will take action accordingly. He has raised up his Servant class and commanded at this time that these shall tell abroad of the honor and glory of his name and how God will vindicate that name amongst the nations. He does this for his name’s sake, and it will result to the benefit and blessing of fallen humankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Now he which stdblisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God.—2 Corinthians 1:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah it is who has given each consecrated one his station in Christ, but let no one conceitedly imagine that he is so immovably established in the body that he cannot be removed because of unfaithfulness and barrenness. Each one thus baptized into the body of Christ is anointed by Jehovah’s spirit. The anointing means a divine designation to a position of service and authority. It carries with it a commission to do certain things, and this commission is well covered by the Lord’s prophet, Isaiah (chapter 61:1-3). It is not beyond the bounds of modesty to assume that those thus anointed will be given an opportunity to exercise themselves in their commission. This is even the case: The opportunity to serve as ambassadors for the kingdom is given to the anointed ones now in this present time as never before. May gratitude for this favor of being among the anointed ones now impel us to faithful effort in representing Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">July 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth.—Romans 8: 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Does Jehovah lay anything to the charge of his elect? No; he justifies. To justify means to make right with God, to approve as being perfect, whole or holy unto him. God justifies the consecrated one in order that he might be an acceptable sacrifice as a part of the body of Christ Jesus. No blemished sacrifice can be accepted by Jehovah. Perfection is counted unto him not by reason of his own righteousness, but by reason of the fact that he has exercised faith in the blood of Jesus shed for him as a sin-offering. When justified, the consecrated one has the right to live as a human being, because he is counted perfect; every perfect man has the right to life. This right to live thus counted to him by Jehovah is the right to live on earth as a human being. This right is what is sacrificed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.—Bomans 9:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah will make a sharp and quick work of gathering his remnant unto him and of announcing the kingdom before the complete end of the evil order. He will cut it short in righteousness, or righteously, because his good purposes have ripened unto their consummation and the world’s iniquity has come to the full. The time is therefore short, and the privileges of the remnant are great beyond the description of human words. The issue today is clearly drawn; the fight is on to the finish; the campaign increases in intensity. Let every Christian who loves God, and who possesses the zeal of Christ in his heart, now give full expression to unselfishness by showing forth God’s praise and the honor of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">July 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land; not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord.—Amos 8:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Because the Israelites walked contrary to Jehovah’s law, he visited them with a great famine in the days of Elijah, true to his warning of Leviticus 26: 26. Similarly, during the Christian era the disobedient course of the people under the leadership of “the shepherds and the principal of the flock” has resulted in the earth’s being famine-stricken for hearing the pure message of God’s comforting Word. The people are spiritually “sick with famine”. They wander to and fro seeking the Word of the Lord and are faint. What an opportunity for the anointed ones of Jehovah on earth at this time, to feed the famine sufferers! God lays his charge upon them, saying, “The priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.” The best way to keep the knowledge of the truth is to use the truth by telling it to others and thus feeding the hungered ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.—1 Corinthians 10:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The temptations that beset those of the world likewise beset those of the church, but Jehovah has prepared a way for the church to escape. That way </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">escape is by fastening our anchor to the Lord, relying upon his promises, and conforming ourselves to the commandment of his Word. Since the ejection of Satan from heaven and his being restrained to the earth, he is assiduously warring with those who keep the commandments of God. The “hour of temptation” has verily come to the church as well as to the world. The great foe is appearing as an angel of light. He insidiously seeks to appeal to the consecrated ones by the avenues of the ‘'“lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life”. Their way of escape lies in setting their affections on things above, waiting on the Lord, and unselfishly prosecuting the Lord’s work to his glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">July 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.—1 Cor. 12:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Order is one of the fundamental laws of Jehovah. He does everything orderly. The Christ is the new creation of God. It is that which will overshadow all other creations of Jehovah. It follows that everything about the new creation must learn to be orderly; and, when finished, everything about it will be orderly. It is certain that each member of the church must learn order. It is one of the hardest lessons for many to learn. No one sets himself in the body of Christ. Jehovah hath done the setting according as it hath pleased him. Then let each one perform the duties assigned to him in the Lord’s arrangement and not be meddling in the affairs assigned to some one else. Order in the body requires each member to do diligently what is appointed him to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen.—Ezekiel 36:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Both Israel after the flesh and professed Christians have profaned the name of Jehovah amongst men and the nations of earth. God must vindicate his name and purify it before the people. The hypocrisy of men and the organized system called Christendom misrepresents God, and must be exposed and destroyed. The terrible things done in the name of God and his beloved Son must not be permitted to stand unchallenged. God in his own good way will vindicate his holy name and destroy his enemies. He commands his Servant class now to be Ills witnesses and tell the people that he is God and that his name shall be magnified in the earth. This witness must be now given before the great and terrible day of the Lord God, at which time he will dash to pieces the fraudulent systems that have taken his name, misrepresented him and defamed his name upon the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">July 12</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God . . . hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts.—2 Corinthians 1:21, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A seal of one possessing authority is placed upon a document to authenticate it, and thereby to give assurance that it is genuine. One could have the seal of no higher authority than that of Jehovah, nor could one have a grander seal. When one is justified, accepted, and begotten by the spirit of Jehovah, he becomes a new creature. God then seals him with the holy spirit, which is an earnest or guarantee of inheritance, which guarantee holds good during one’s faithfulness until the inheritance is received. The one thus receiving the holy spirit, and the witness of the spirit that he is the son of God, thereby has the authentication of his genuineness as a new creature in Christ Jesus. He is not left to doubt or to grope about in the dark, but has the full assurance, given to him by this guarantee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me ... to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes.—Isaiah 61:1, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The unselfish ones in Zion remember this part of the commission that accompanies their anointing. “Ashes” symbolize deep humiliation, great sorrow and woe. These may come to the Christian because of the seeming triumph of the enemy, or of injustice that others may practise against him. If an anointed one of the Lord finds his brother in Zion suffering such humiliation, sorrow or woe, from any reason, Jehovah commissions him to give him beauty for ashes. “Beauty” is a symbol of embellishment or ornament about the head or of the mind. To give beauty then means to point the mourning ones to something that will ornament their minds, to induce happy and beautiful thoughts, and thereby bring strength. We should call their attention to their divinely-given commission and bid them to arise and shine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">July 14</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me ... to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them . . . the oil of joy for mourning.—Isaiah 61:1,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Joy” means gladness, satisfaction and delight because of the blessings of goodness, present or hoped for, both for oneself and for other creatures obedient to Jehovah’s law. Jesus’ joy consisted in possessing sweet fellowship with Jehovah, and the prospect and certainty of vindicating his Father’s name and bringing all the obedient ones of mankind back into full harmony with God. If we possess the blessings of the goodness of the Lord now, or have reason to expect such blessings in the near future and therefore have a hope for the same, such brings joy and delight. If the anointed ones encounter any of their brethren in Zion in mournful distress, Jehovah’s commission to them is to dispel this mourning by giving him the oil of joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me ... to appoint unto them that</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mourn in Zion, to give unto them ... the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ness.—Isaiah 61:1, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A garment is a covering by which one is marked or distinguished, and which reflects one’s state of mind. Praise means due acknowledgment and proclamation of the perfections, the great and wonderful excellencies of Jehovah, and to laud and magnify his name. It means to mention with joy Jehovah’s great plan and how it is revealed and carried into action. To put on the garment of praise therefore means to distinguish oneself by boldly, fearlessly and joyfully proclaiming the truth, advertising the King and his kingdom; and by pointing the people to the fact that Jehovah is God, and that his power is now being lovingly manifested on behalf of mankind. Jehovah commissions his anointed ones to assist brethren who are in the “spirit of heaviness”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">July 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun hnoweth his going down.—Psalm 104:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah ordained the sun and the moon to give light to the physical sight of man by day and by night. But grander far, he has given to spiritual Israel, “the children of light,” a knowledge of his will. It illuminates their pathway as the silvery moon of night and now in this season of God’s plan it shines with the effulgence of the sun. He has given them the light of the new day, the sunlight of the kingdom message, which now shines with the brilliancy of seven suns. To those who faithfully walk in the light and reflect it upon others Jehovah’s Word says: “Thus saith the Lord, which giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, ... If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the Lord, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me . . . that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Isaiah 61:1, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font3">tree is a symbol of a creature possessing everlasting life. The trees of righteousness above mentioned mean the various members of the new creation. These trees are planted by Jehovah, and those who are faithful to the end will be granted life everlasting on the divine plane. They will compose a wonderful grove of 144,000 and one trees, the one being the great Head, Christ Jesus, and will be an everlasting monument to the glory of the Almighty God. He will give these trees of righteousness for the blessing and peace and life of the world. In the midst of the great highway and on either side of the river of truth they will bear their fruit and will feed and heal and bless all the obedient ones of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">July 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the Lord of hosts,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings.—Malachi 2: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the day of Malachi the prophet, God had done much to restore the people of Israel to their former privileges; but they were ungrateful and continued to be disobedient. God therefore told them that he would send the curse upon them, and did so. That foreshadowed what shall befall organized Christianity, or Christendom. Jehovah through his prophet foretells how the wicked systems shall be discomfited and destroyed. (Jeremiah 25: 29-35) The anointed Servant class is now charged with the obligation of giving notice to the people of God’s purpose concerning Christendom. The anointed cannot disregard this obligation and receive God’s favor. They must be on the alert now. Let there be no slacking of the hands at this time! The faithful will continue to proclaim the honor of Jehovah’s name to the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">How much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Matthew 7:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We may be sure that the Father is pleased to have us ask for such things as we need. But asking, we must also exercise our faculties with which we are endowed to provide such things as are necessary. No one should think that he can sit down and idly fold his hands and expect the Lord to put into his lap just such things as he may need. Jehovah’s way of providing is by giving us an opportunity of cooperating with him in acquiring the things needed. His child, then, will pray and diligently act in harmony with his prayer. This is the rule in spiritual things: “Ask, and ye shall receive.” But act in harmony with such asking. Having acquired the knowledge by which we may know the will of God, then we must diligently endeavor to conform ourselves to that will. Following the divine rule, we shall not want.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">July 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">have such an high priest, ... a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lord pitched, and not man.—Hebrews 8:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah, and not man, pitched the true and spiritual tabernacle, in which by his spirit he will dwell with mankind during the Millennial Day. When the time came for building the typical tabernacle in the Wilderness of Sin, Jehovah called one individual by name. He particularly and specially designated and invited him to have charge of the work and with his assistants to prepare the tabernacle furnishings. Jehovah said to Moses: “See, I have called by name Bezaleel [meaning, God is Protection or in the Shadow (i. e., protection) of God], the son of Uri [Light, the light of the world], the son of Hur [white, noble, also pit; the noble One lay dead three days in the pit], of the tribe of Judah [Praised, in his prehuman condition] : and I have filled him with the spirit of God.” Bezaleel represented Christ Jesus, whom Jehovah made the minister of the true tabernacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">July 21 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Romans 8:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah calls or invites none with the heavenly calling except those who are justified. None should get the thought that because they have once been called with the one hope of our calling they are always in the called class. There is a limit to God’s favors. He is not calling into the bride class any who have once known him and then have measurably forgotten him. The Scriptures define these as wicked because, though once they heard, they have turned away from the truth again to the exercise of their selfish wills. (Psalm 50:16,17) The faithful ones are those who remain in the heart relationship with God in which they were when they responded to his gracious call. They keep on showing forth the praises of him who called them. Jehovah has predestinated that the laurels of victory shall rest upon them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Let no man say when he is tempted, 1 am tempted of God: for God cannot he tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man.—James 1:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah is infinitely above all the enticements of temptation to evil. He is holy and righteous and cannot deny the law of his own being. Hence the present temptation of the church comes not from Jehovah, but from Satan through the avenue of the world. It is presented now in three ways; namely, as to the body, as to the mind, and as to the will. Every one who will be of the kingdom must resist and overcome this threefold temptation. He must refuse to use his spiritual powers for personal gain, but must present his body a ‘diving sacrifice” daily; he must be absolutely invulnerable to the attractive glamour of the world and be loyal to Jehovah, to Jesus, to God’s Word, and to his work; he must have no self-pride or self-ambition to run ahead of the Lord, but be willing and anxious to follow where the Lord leads and to do what the Lord directs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The woman fled into the wilderness, zvhere she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.—Revelation 12: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah duly provided a place for the safety and nourishment of his anointed ones on earth who represented Zion, the woman. On March 27, 1919, the day immediately following release from prison, the officers of the Lord's organization on earth began formulating plans for aiding the church and furthering the witness. Then it was that the woman, Zion, fled into the wilderness unto the divinely provided place. This place seems to symbolize the condition prepared by Jehovah’s providence for those on earth who represented Zion and in whose mouths he put his words and whom he covered with the shadow of his hand. In that condition they remained until “the day” when, with the fearlessness of Elisha and with the glorious vision of the Lord enthroned in his temple, they joyfully emerged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">July 24</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—James</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> 4</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A refusal to submit to God’s law or to be governed by his rule of action is the result of selfishness and pride; and such Jehovah pushes away from him. For one to seek his own glory and honor could not be pleasing to the heavenly Father. When Jesus was on earth he did not seek to glorify himself, but always sought to honor and glorify Jehovah. Each one to be pleasing to the Lord must likewise keep himself in the background and should always honor Jehovah and Jesus. To be humble means to be submissive to God’s will. His will concerning the church is expressed in his Word. Humility therefore means to obey God’s law. Those who cheerfully obey receive unfailing supplies of grace from Jehovah through Christ Jesus, and the honor of serving him always upholds them.—Proverbs 29: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">In all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.—Exodus 20:21}..</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Israel’s day there were certain places where God put his name, such as Jerusalem. There God would have his people meet at stated times to worship him. Israel worshiped Jehovah by obeying him. It is just as certain that God now marks out for his people the place where they must worship him. It is only as God’s appointments are followed that blessings can be expected. His people worship him now and show forth his praises and honor his name by being obedient to his commandments in his appointed way. God’s organization on earth is Zion made up of the anointed ones working harmoniously together and who are singing the honor of his name. The Society is the place appointed for his work and worship. Those who please him must do what God commands to be done, and must do it when and where he tells them to do it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the Lord for a name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Isaiah 55:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When the obedient men of earth are restored to perfection the earth will be a place of real delight. The desert, now parched and barren, will then yield its increase. No thorn shall then encumber the ground, nor any brier disturb the feelings of the tiller of the soil. Instead, the earth shall bring forth trees and plants of beauty, and shall yield fruit for the pleasure and sustenance of man. Then will the footstool of Jehovah be glorious. By faith the saints are shown these things in advance. They enjoy them by anticipation, and will delight to see the peoples of earth enjoy them in God’s due time. These saints now have the privilege to tell the people of these coming blessings and thus to sing forth the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">July 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south: hut God is the fudge; he putteth down one, and setteth up another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 75: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It seems to be entirely in harmony with the Scriptures to say that one’s position in the body of Christ may be changed by Jehovah from time to time. As one proves faithful to that which has been committed to him, he may be advanced to a different place. Since the church is God’s organization, it follows that if the church organization acts according to the prescribed rule laid down in the Lord’s Word, we are warranted in the view that the Lord promotes his servants in the body of Christ this side the vail. If such continue faithful unto death, then they have the assurance that God, through Christ, will assign them to a position of relative importance in the glorified body of Christ beyond the vail. May all then, who are heartily striving to please and serve the Lord, take their changes in his service as being from him, the great Judge, and endeavor to be unmurmuring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">July 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling: for it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. — Phil. 2:12, IS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Apostle Paul straightforwardly told the church that his presence with the brethren should not be the incentive for them to work out their salvation according to the rules laid down in God’s Word. They should not seek to please men, even men who are prominent servants of the Lord, with eyeservice. They should seek to be faithful just as much when out of sight of their more prominent brethren as when these brethren are present, always bearing this in mind that it is not a mere man or human force that is working in then- midst but that it is Jehovah God who is working among them. His power rests upon them; his eye observes their efforts; and he is the one to be pleased first of all. He is the one who should furnish the incentive to be faithful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—John 5:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s deep love for his only begotten Son prompted him to take his Son into close counsel with himself and to show him all his works which were due to be performed in behalf of man’s salvation. This he did that his Son might be his trustworthy witness to the world and might keep in harmony with the will and work of his Father. It was at Jesus’ anointing of the spirit that Jehovah began to show him the work in which his Son was to be his great Executive Officer, a High Priest after the order of Melchizedek. It was at that time that “the heavens were opened unto him” and the Lamb of God began to unroll the scroll of the divine plan which he had received of the Father.—Rev. 5: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">July 30</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thus saith the Lord God, Remove the diadem, and take off the crown; ... I will overturn, overturn, overturn it; and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and 1 will give it him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Ezekiel 21:26, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Six hundred and six years before Christ, Jehovah executed his decree of overturning. The right of the Solomonic line to the kingdom passed from them, as the diadem and crown were removed from their heads and overturned. But the sceptre did not depart from Judah. Our Lord Jesus sprang from the tribe of Judah; when he had been immersed in Jordan, there Shiloh came, and Jehovah gave to him the sceptre and the right to the regal diadem and crown. For nearly nineteen centuries the exalted Jesus was seated at the right hand of the majesty on high. But it was not until 1914 A. D. that he wielded his sceptre; for then it was that Jehovah sent the rod of his strength out of Zion. This is the day of Jesus’ power as King. If so, then we as his people should be willing and joyfully volunteer for service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">In the days of these Kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never he destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">-—Daniel 2:44-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Gentile Times ended in 1914. Earthas rightful King was then present, but his first work (since 1874) was a preparatory work for the beginning of his reign. In the last days of the Gentile kings the God of heaven has begun to set up the promised kingdom, and now God is serving notice upon the peoples to that effect. The members of the kingdom class now on earth occupy a position of honor that no one else on earth can hold. They are the honored servants of the Lord. They, as earthly representatives, are the ambassadors of the kingdom of God, and are clothed with authority to tell mankind of that kingdom and the blessings it will bring to them. Their mission is one of love. The angels of heaven have never enjoyed such honor as theirs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord is a man of war: the Lord is his name. —Exodus 15:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah fought as a man of war when he delivered the people from the bondage of Pharaoh. He arranged the battie and then engaged in it. That picture is for the people of God of the present time when the great reality is about to be performed completely. Jehovah will make complete destruction of the enemy and complete deliverance of his people by what is termed “set warfare”. He has a work for his anointed saints to do in connection therewith, but that work is not the use of carnal weapons. As the sweet singers were placed in the van of Israel’s army when Jehoshaphat led them out to battle against the enemy, so now God’s people are permitted to sing forth the praises of his name and tell the people of earth what God has declared he will do, while God proceeds to the destruction of the enemy organization. God will thus show himself a man of war, and will completely vindicate his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lord will not impute sin. — Romans 4:7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The covering for sins is the merit of Christ Jesus, imputed to such as confess their transgressions and crave Jehovah’s forgiveness, and who have a desire to do his will. This covering should not be confused with “the robe of righteousness”. (Isaiah 61:10) The nonimputation of sin to the Christian is equal to the actual imputation of righteousness. Otherwise stated, where one has an abiding faith in Christ Jesus and in God’s Word and has an honest and sincere desire in his heart to be free from sin and to be righteous, Jehovah can treat such an one as whole or righteous. The reason is that God looks at the heart; that is to say, God counts evil to the one who has an evil intent, whether he commits the overt act or not; and likewise God counts righteousness unto the Christian, who naturally is not righteous, because of his heart’s devotion to righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">August 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I will make him my firstborn, higher than the Kings of the earth.—Psalm 89: 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus, anointed at the Jordan to be King, was clothed with all power and authority at his resurrection. Having waited on Jehovah’s due time for him to act against the enemy, he now goes forth as King and God’s Executive Officer to make war. God has placed him upon the throne, and commands that all shall obey him because he is higher than all earthly kings. Upon earth there are yet some of the feet members of The Christ. These are commissioned to tell the people of the blessed time now at hand, that Jehovah is God, Christ is King, and the day of deliverance is here. To fulfil such commission seems to be the only reason why the last members of Christ are yet on the earth. The faithful will finish the work assigned to them, and then will be received into heavenly glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smolce. . . . before the great and the terrible day of the Lord come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Joel 2:30, 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Has not Jehovah shown his people wonders in the heavens, by giving them a better vision than heretofore of the Devil’s organization and of the birth of the nation, of the casting of Satan out of heaven, and of the preparation for the great and final battle on the earth? Blood and fire are symbols of death and destruction. In the earth during the past few years there has been a great amount of death and destruction. Smoke arises where fire burns; and now we see pillars of smoke resting upon Christendom, betraying the destructive fires that are burning there. Its leaders have turned the light of the kingdom message into dense darkness. The will of Jehovah, symbolized by the moon, has become to many the symbol of death. Noting these fulfilments of prophecy, God’s witnesses should rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">August 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">After that he gave unto them judges, about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the prophet.—Acts 13:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The period of the judges, from Joshua to Samuel, was a period marked by Jehovah’s deliverances of the people. The record of this time is one of repeated departures of the people of Israel from the law of the Lord. What did the Lord do? Cast them off for ever? No; he permitted them to be chastised at the hand of their enemies; and then when they had learned their lesson and were penitent and cried unto the Lord, he brought them deliverance. “When the Lord raised them up judges, then the Lord was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge.” Herein we see illustrated greater deliverance, not alone for Israel but for all mankind, from Satan, sin, and death. The great Judge whom Jehovah has ordained to be the Deliverer is Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The name of the God of Jacob defend thee.—Psalm 20:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah defends them! The thought makes </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">Christians shout for joy. In giving their testimony to the name of Jehovah, which they love, they realize the danger to which they are subjected, because they know that the evil one now seeks to destroy all those who keep the commandments of God. Yet they have greater boldness than ever in proclaiming the message of God’s kingdom, because they love God. They have no fear. Confidently they rely upon Jehovah, who has promised to preserve those who love him and who are faithful. Threatening evil does not deter one when he knows he is perfectly protected. As long as he is faithful the Christian is perfectly and completely defended by </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Je</span><span class="font3">hovah. Over such God places his hand in love. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font3">Christian’s joy overflows in singing the praises of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Je</span><span class="font3">hovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">August 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhdbiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place.—Isaiah 57:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah is holy. He dwells in the holy place because in that place of his sacred dwelling his will is always done and it is always right. Wrong never defiles that holy place. Jehovah God the lofty One has ever pursued and will evermore pursue a course of righteousness and perfection. “The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.” (Psalm 145:17) His course is always the same; there is no change in him. He says: “I am Jehovah, I change not.” (Malachi 3:6) From the course of righteousness he never deviates. His law, his rule of action, is always perfect. His every act is unselfish; therefore he is love. How could we come into the presence of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font3"> Holy One without holiness! No wonder Jehovah admonishes us through his apostle, saying, 'Without holiness shall no man see the Lord.’ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He shall build, an house for my name, and, I will stdblish the throne of his kingdom for ever.—2 Samuel 7:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These words were spoken concerning Solomon. The temple was not to he a memorial to the name of David or to Solomon. It was for the name of Jehovah. Solomon foreshadowed God’s great Son Jesus. In due time he builded the true temple of Jehovah his Father. The name of Jehovah is set upon this temple, and God has placed Christ the King upon his throne. The knowledge of these things has brought to God’s people faith and courage. They must now tell out these truths to the nations and bear witness to the establishment of God’s kingdom and his name for ever. The members of the temple class must perform their part. Therefore it is written: “In his temple doth every one speak of his glory.” It is the will of God for each one who believes he is a follower of Christ to inquire.of himself: Am I doing my part to declare the glory of Jehovah’s name? The Lord has given opportunity to all such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">August 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth.—Psalm 60:4-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The day is here when Jehovah will make it known that he is the Mighty One who has placed his King upon his throne. To his faithful remnant class he says: “Ye are my witnesses.” To these he gives a banner inscribed with the truth. A banner is a flag on a staff or a standard which is held high that others may be guided thereby. The Lord has placed in the hands of his people his banner ot standard of his kingdom. He commands them to march with it towards the kingdom and to lift it up for the benefit of others. So clearly is the course of the saints marked out that there can be no doubt about what they are to do now. The message of truth is prepared in such form that all the saints may have a part in holding it forth. Blessed is he who joyfully lifts high this banner to the glory of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">For whom he foreknow, he also foreordained to be conformed to the image of his Son.—Romans 8:29, B. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The new creation is the highest part of the works of Jehovah. The nature of that creation is divine. Jesus Christ is the beginning and the Head thereof. He stands preeminently above all. Having foreordained the new creation, God’s will is that each member thereof shall be conformed to the image of his beloved Son. Each one must resemble the Head. Jesus was wholly devoted to his Father. Each one who will ultimately be a member of Christ’s body must, while on earth, wholly devote his life to God. When one is begotten to the divine nature he does not see so clearly the divine requirements; but as he walks in the light and comes nearer to the perfect day, he sees more clearly the necessity of being like Jesus. This foreordained likeness means a complete devotion to God in harmony with the covenant of sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">August 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for 1 will work a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though it be told you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Habakkuk 1:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord is at work in our days in a manner most manifest to Christian eyes. Among all the heathen, or nations, this work is being projected; and the people of Christendom regard it and wonder and marvel. Contrary to what human minds would think or believe, Jehovah has raised up the meek, the insignificant, and the poor of this world, and a few in number they are at that. He has entrusted to them the most glorious and also the boldest of messages, the message of destruction to Satan’s empire and the victorious rise of Christ’s kingdom. These Jehovah has made his representatives and witnesses, but has passed by the ecclesiastical lords and leaders of Christendom and made their wisdom to perish and their understanding to be hid. Satan’s organization does not believe God’s purpose though it is told to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He spaice by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began: that we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us.—Luke 1:10, 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God’s prophets were “holy men of old”; therefore Jehovah put his Word into their mouths and spake by them. Their message was holy, because Jehovah is holy and any message which would proceed from him would partake of and reflect his own qualities and would be as much a part of him as his own organism. The prophets all spake of deliverance, of restitution. The Bible records stern truths about these men; and judged by the false standard that Satan holds up by his representatives, they could never be counted holy. They were far from coming up to the Lord’s high standard. Nevertheless, Jehovah counted them holy, not because they were perfect in the flesh, not because they had “developed a character”, but because despite their-human wealmesses they were absolutely and unswervingly devoted to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">August 13</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God hath spoken in his holiness.—Psalm 108:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Because Jehovah is holy he speaks in holiness, and everything that proceeds from him is holy. God’s apostle therefore consistently refers to the Bible, God’s Word, as “the holy scriptures”. (Romans 1:2) How foolish then for mortals of the present time, who “despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities”, to refer to the Bible in disrespectful terms! How foolish for any man so far to forget himself as to reject the Word of God, particularly for those who once believed upon the Word of the Lord! The Bible’s precious truths are not to be cast before everybody. For this reason Jesus said: “Give not that which is holy unto the dogs.” The message of Jehovah is holy, and should be regarded and treated thus by all who claim to know the Lord. The time will come when every creature that is granted the privilege of life will realize that God’s Word is holy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.—Acts 14:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All the works of Jehovah and all his acts testify as true witnesses to his goodness. His goodness means being everything that is true, reliable, benevolent, gracious, pure, righteous, holy, and in everything and in every way being opposed to that which is evil. Jehovah’s goodness has been manifested to all who have sought to know him. The nations have not known God and God has suffered them to walk in their own ways. But they have had witness given to them of the goodness of the great invisible One, in that he has permitted them to reap the benefits and bounties of the rain and the seasons and the forces of nature which Jehovah has put into operation. Nor will this testimony be lost; for in due time all nations shall look back and remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">August 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jerusalem, the city which the Lord did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Kings 14:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jerusalem was the city chosen for the place of the temple. The place where the worship of Jehovah shall be centered in heavenly Jerusalem is God’s organization. There only can he be worshiped. All who would now enjoy the blessings of God must acknowledge his city; that is, his organization. They must deport themselves in accordance with the rules relating to that city or organization. Failing to acknowledge God’s place of power is a failure to acknowledge God, regardless of how much profession one may make. The anointed Servant class on earth constitutes his organization on earth. These are doing the work which Jehovah has commanded shall be done at this time. There is no other organization that is doing the Lord’s work on earth. There may be a change from time to time in the personnel, but the organization God will keep in proper order and at work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord preserveth the faithful.—Psalm 31:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No one could prove faithful without being put to the test. For this reason God graciously permits the adversary to beset his anointed ones. Jesus was subjected to the most severe trials, and in all of them he was faithful to his Father. He was tempted to compromise with the Devil and his organization. He gained the victory in the test. All his followers must be subjected to similar tests. The test now is severe, but those who walk in the light rejoice to avail themselves of every opportunity to tell of God and his King and his kingdom. Such enjoy sweet peace, because they are fully confident that God will preserve them from all evil. They fear not, because God is greater than all who can be against them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">August 17</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the Lord that rendereth recompense</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">to his enemies.—Isaiah 66: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the city, that is, from those who claim to be of God’s organization, there comes a voice of noise, a discordant sound that is not in harmony with what Jehovah is doing. But from the temple there comes a voice of the Lord. It is a beautiful and harmonious voice because it is in perfect attune with the Lord. It is the message proclaimed by the Elisha class; for the voice is a symbol of a message of truth. It is being proclaimed by those who are the feet of The Christ and whom God has made watchmen. Of them the prophet says: “Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing.” They sing forth the joyous kingdom message out of the Lord’s temple, while Jehovah renders vengeance to his enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord . , . revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.—Amos 3:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The new creature in Christ becomes a prophet of the Lord when that new creature avails himself of opportunities to proclaim the message of the kingdom of the Lord. Such are members of the “servant” class to whom God has given the com</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">m</span><span class="font3">ission to declare that Jehovah is God and Christ is his anointed King upon the throne. Since the Lord has come to his temple there are flashes of light revealing more of the secrets of God’s marvelous Works. Those who love the Lord obey his commandments, and more and more he leads them into the light. Those who are negligent or indifferent, and who fail or refuse to participate in the Lord’s service, quickly become blind; but those who faithfully perform their covenant by serving the Lord claim this promise of having God’s secrets.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">In that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Zechariah 12:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jerusalem in the setting the Lord here gives it in the prophecy evidently refers to his organization of all his spirit-begotten ones in the earth. Opposition in this day is to be expected by them; for Satan wants to continue as the god of this world, and will logically oppose all who stand for Jehovah as God. The anointed ones of the Lord, as they faithfully give their witness and advertise the King and the kingdom, are naturally burdensome to those who are in favor of the kings and kingdoms of Satan’s organization. These may be expected to gather against God’s organization, Jerusalem, in the earth in the effort to rid themselves of this weight burdensome to them. But Jehovah’s remnant should take courage; the Lord will protect and deliver his faithful ones and will disperse and destroy their assailants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">August 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pout you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.—Malachi 3:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is written, “Thou shalt not tempt the Lord </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">thy </span><span class="font3">God”; but Jehovah encourages his saints to prove him true to his promises by continuing in that course of faithfulness which merits the fulfilment of his good promises. The Lord in his temple is now purifying the “sons of Levi” that they may offer unto him an offering in righteousness. His command now goes to them: “Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse.” A tithe is a tenth. Ten symbolizes all in an earthly sense; </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">tenth, or tithe, represents the whole and likewise symbolizes all. (Numbers 18:25-28) The Levites of old offered tithes to the high priest as unto the Lord. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“The </span><span class="font3">sons of Levi” who now bring their tithes, their earthly all, what blessings Jehovah pours down upon them!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">August 21</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">It came to pass, when the Lord would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind.—2 Kings 2:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Prophet Elijah and his companion, Elisha, both represented the same class of Christians but at different </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">periods</span><span class="font3"> in the church’s history, and pictured therefore different works to be done by the same people. A fiery chariot separated Elijah and Elisha and Jehovah took Elijah away heavenward in a whirlwind. In the spring of 1918 the World War, pictured by the whirlwind, was at its height. During this raging whirlwind fiery experiences arose in the chariot, the vehicle, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society,</span><span class="font3"> throughout the earth; and a separation of the work to be done by the Elijah and the Elisha class was clearly marked. There was a sudden cessation of the work. The fiery experiences which came as a result of the assault upon the Society and its work marked the dividing line of the two parts of the work. The Elijah part of the church’s work ceased, to be followed by the Elisha work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The works that I do in my Father’s name, they bear witness of me.—John 10:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus wrought many miracles. Those miracles called attention to himself; but Jesus would always have it understood that he performed them by tire power of God his Father. Here is a sure and certain guide for those who serve the Lord in these days. The servants do their work in the strength of the Lord. Their works bear witness to those who hear that such are servants of God, and thereby God is near and glorified. Jesus said: “If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.” The works which he did bore witness that he came from his Father. The work that the Servant class now does bears witness that it is done by the power of God and therefore that such are his servants. Their work is not to glorify self, but to show forth the honor of him who has clothed them with power and opportunity of service. It is absolutely essential to learn this lesson and to follow the lead of Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">August 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Colossians 3:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Members of the new creation are not “dual” creatures. The “old man” is the evil tendency and course of action that the unregenerate creature follows in using his mind and will to gratify his flesh and selfish desires. The “new man” which Jehovah has created is the new creature in Christ, with the mind, will, heart and organism devoted to the Lord. The “outward man” is that which others see; but the “inner man” is that which Jehovah looks upon, namely, the mind, will and heart devoted to him, in harmony with the covenant by sacrifice. The outward man, which others see, is perishing; but if it is being used up in harmony with the terms of the covenant with God then the inward man, namely, the mind, will and heart, is daily growing more into the likeness of the Lord and is being renewed in knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Nahum 1:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Jehovah reigneth.” In 1914 he set his kingly Son upon the throne as King of kings and Lord of lords. The beginning of his reign is while his enemies are still in power on the earth, and hence is accompanied by the storm clouds of disastrous trouble. “Clouds and darkness are round about him”; but the clouds are simply the dust stirred up by his feet, the outward indication of his steady march to victory. In due time he will raise up a great whirlwind from the coasts of the earth, and the slain of the Lord in that day shall be from one end of the earth to the other. This will be the way the Lord Jehovah will take to awe even Satan’s hosts with his might and to exalt his name above all and bring deliverance to enslaved and dying mankind. Wherefore “strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. Say to them of a fearful heart, Be strong.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">August 25</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God . . . quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.—Romans 1:17. </span><span class="font3">Jehovah called Abraham “a father of many nations” when as yet he was not such. At the burning bush which Moses beheld at the mount of God, Jehovah called himself the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob when in fact these patriarchs did not exist but were dead. This manifests Jehovah’s utmost confidence in his own plans. It shows his own certainty that his callings and promises are sure of fulfilment. It expresses his own unchanging purpose never to deviate from the course outlined in his Word; not one jot or tittle shall go unkept. It evinces his own foreknowledge of what shall be according to his perfect and righteous plans. From this all may take consolation, knowing that inasmuch as Jehovah hath called them to the heavenly kingdom he will surely give them a place therein if they are faithful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">August </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">26</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.—Psalm 34:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Elisha was at Dothan, performing the duties which God had laid upon him. He was beset by a great host of the enemy. Elisha had no fear, because he knew that God was with him. At that time there was surrounding Elisha, but invisible to others, an heavenly host there for his protection. Now the church is doing the Elisha work at Jehovah’s command. The enemy has gathered in great force to make war against those who keep God’s commandments, bearing testimony to his name. But the Elisha class have no cause for fear, because God has surrounded them with his protection. This is the fight of Jehovah God, and not our fight. True, we are privileged to have part in the fight, but our part is to sing the praises of God with boldness and with joy, and God will see to it that his angels protect us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">August 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">It shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. For it is not ye that speak, but the spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Matthew 10:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Wherever the witness is to be given, and wherever Jehovah may bring his witnesses to deliver testimony to his name, we may be sure that the spirit of the Lord will be present to empower his witnesses. Not that Jehovah’s spirit will operate the tongue and lips of his servants mechanically, and cause them to utter things for which they have no moral responsibility before him; but if one is filled with the Lord’s spirit, that is, if one is willing to witness for Jehovah under extraordinary conditions and one’s love of the Lord is perfect and easts out fear of man which brings a snare, then Jehovah will display the power of his spirit in his servants. They will speak not their own message, but the things which Jehovah speaks in his Word and which he has made them to know and understand by the power of his spirit. He will bless their minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.—Psalm 102:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Having tested and tried his beloved Son on earth, Jehovah laid him in Zion as a tried and precious stone, a sure foundation. At Pentecost Jehovah began the selection of the other living stones to compose his holy temple, the official residence of the family of God. The building up of Zion undoubtedly means the Lord’s coming to his temple in 1918; for he comes to his temple before the great witness is given to the glory of Jehovah’s name. It logically follows, and the Scriptures seem strongly to bear it out, that the temple of God was brought together in 1918, and that that marks the time of the awakening of the sleeping saints. All this then would mark the time for “the glorious appearing of the great God”. Therefore rejoice, all ye who love the Lord’s appearing! Sing forth the honor of his name!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">August 29</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.—James 5:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The servants of Jehovah who have been and are faithful in honoring his name have suffered, and it has pleased God to allow such to be tested in patience. The faithful prophets are set forth as examples to God’s Servant class at the present time. In these days God’s servants are misunderstood, and many wrongful statements are made of and concerning them. Reproaches fall upon them similar to those which reproached Jesus. The Servant class of today is blessed with greater knowledge of Jehovah than those of the past because it is God’s due time for such increase of knowledge. Such should enable the Servant class to more faithfully and patiently endure persecution which comes upon them as a result of devotion to the Lord. Faith and true courage are required to go on in the service of the Lord. Those who honor his name receive honor from him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">August 30</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that 1 rise up for a testimony [Rotherham and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">LXX; . . . for all the earth shall he devoured with the fire of my jealousy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Zephaniah 3:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Christendom’s ruling factors have refused to heed the Lord’s warnings; for this reason Jehovah purposes to rise up in his jealousy for the vindication of his name. In the battle of Armageddon he will exert his power and give a most impressive testimony as to his deity and his supremacy. But first, true to his regular course of action, he serves notice upon both the ruling classes and the ruled masses as to his judgment and determination against Satan’s organization. Meantime the Lord’s remnant are to wait upon him until he rises up in his power; they are not to wait indolently, but to redeem the time by serving as the Lord’s witnesses to notify the people of Jehovah’s purposes. The Lord stopped the World War that they might give this testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">August 31</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I am come in my Father’s name.—John 5:43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus was both the Son and the Servant of his Father Jehovah. A covenant had been made with Israel at Sinai. Jesus came in his Father’s name, and here is to be noted a covenant between Father and Son. He came by the authority of his Father, representing him and to tell the Jews of his Father’s purpose. That was the first time God is presented by the name Father. The Father had made a covenant with his Son for the kingdom. By authority from his Father Jesus invited those who believed on him to have a part in that covenant by becoming the sons of God. All who have become sons by reason of entering into the covenant with Jehovah are duty-bound as opportunity offers to bear witness to the honor of the Father’s name. Such Jesus did when on earth. Now the body members on earth are privileged to bear witness in the name and by the authority of the Father. His purpose is for all such to honor his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I come and smite the earth with a curse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Malachi 4:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Elijah’s activities pictured a particular work done by the church under the supervision of her Head, Christ Jesus. It follows, then, that the Elijah work must be done between the beginning of the Lord’s presence and the day of smiting the earth with a curse. The effort was to convert Christendom to a humble, childlike condition, making them teachable as children, and turning their hearts from error, sin, and unfaithfulness, and leading them back into harmony with the great heavenly Father and the writings of his holy men of old. The work did not succeed in accomplishing this, but did fulfil Jehovah’s command: “Gather my saints together unto me, those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.” Because the Elijah work did not result in turning Christendom to the Lord, the earth is now being smitten.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark282"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark283"></a>September 2</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Matthew 5:45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of the Millennium it is written that whosoever will not come up submissively to God’s organization, Jerusalem, to worship and serve the Lord, upon such there shall be no rain. Other natural blessings will be held from the refractory ones then, but during the present season Jehovah is showing forbearance and mercy toward all in bestowing the common blessings of nature upon all. God exercises mercy. Mercy may be defined as a forbearance to inflict harm under circumstances of provocation when one has the power to inflict it. It is a compassionate treatment of another. It is pity put into action. The Apostle Paul exhorts the Christians in respect of showing mercy, saying, “Be ye imitators of God, as dear children,” “forgiving one another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ye shall serve: 1 have given your priest's office unto you as a service of gift.—Numbers 18:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has given the office of the priesthood to both Jesus and the church, his body. On Israel’s atonement day the high priest did the sacrificing. Serving with the high priest the underpriests would bring to the high priest that which was to be sacrificed. Christ Jesus is the great real High Priest, and it is he who is offering up his body members as a part of his own sacrifice. The body members are counted in by him as a part of his sacrifice. No member of the body, while in the flesh, is qualified to offer anything unto God. That office of offering unto God belongs to Jesus Christ. His body members, when complete and glorified, will then become a part of the High Priest; and then, and not till then, will such body members participate in the sin-offering. They participate by virtue of the fact that they are members of the body. But while in the flesh each one must do something in order to perform his covenant with Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">September 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God is no respecter of persons.—Acts 10:34</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As a man each consecrating one gives up his right to live on earth as a perfect human being. Therefore it is apparent that the sacrifice of each and every justified one is exactly the same. Let no one then exalt himself in his own estimation by thinking that he has made a greater sacrifice than has his brother who is weak and unpolished. Let no poor, uneducated one, without ability to make for himself a name or to accomplish much of anything else, be discouraged by thinking that his sacrifice as a man is much less than that of his abler brother. Up to this point Jehovah respects them exactly the same, so far as their sacrifice is concerned. They each have made a like covenant with him. The question thereafter is, Will each perform his covenant with faithfulness? The one who does perform his covenant with faithfulness will have an abundant entrance into the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">September 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1 will publish the name of the Lord: ascribe ye greatness unto our God.—Deuteronomy 32:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When God’s people were about to enter the land of promise, Moses spoke the words of this text. They were written for the benefit of Jehovah’s servants of the present time, at which time he is leading his people into their inheritance. The anointed must now publish the name of Jehovah, and ascribe unto God the greatness and majesty that are his. He who does these things in the true spirit will find himself to be the recipient of God’s richest blessings. The inducing motive, however, should not be that the creature might receive some rich blessing from his Maker, but he should be moved by an unselfish desire to honor the name of Jehovah. All of his works, as Moses declared, are perfect. The completed new creation will be the grandest amongst his works. He will place in the completed temple those who now willingly and gladly publish his holy name that others might know that he is the Most High God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">September 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.—Psalm 40:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The mere surrendering of something unto God at the loss of another is not that which is pleasing unto him. God never profits by reason of sacrifice. “I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving. This also shall please the Lord better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.” (Psalm 69:30, 31) It is the doing of the will of God that is pleasing to him. The pleasing part that the Christian performs is to heed God’s admonition as given through the Apostle Paul to present his body daily; that is to say, to keep himself always ready and on the alert to use all faculties with which he is endowed and which operate through his body, to the glory of God in the performance of his covenant. This is his “reasonable service” and should be rendered with joy and rejoicing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.—Job 33:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At this time the sick and afflicted human race is in the miserable and unhappy condition described by Job’s visitor, Elihu. Their souls verily draw near to the grave and their life to the destroyers who are preparing for the worst conflict of human history. Is there anything we can do for them in their distresses and fears? There is; for we can bear to them the enlightening and comforting message of God’s Word. We can assure them that Jehovah has sent a Messenger, to interpret God’s Word and make it plain, that they might know the only true God and Jesus Christ his Son, and go over the highway that leads to life. And if they now draw near to God through his Word, and find and accept their ransom, Jehovah may be gracious unto them and say: “Deliver him from going down to the pit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">September 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">It came to pass, the selfsame dag, that the Hord did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.—Exodus 12:51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Speaking of his deliverance of the children of Israel after the economic wrecking of Egypt and the bereavement of its first-born, Jehovah says: “Eor I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I. gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.” It was at a tremendous ransom-cost to Egypt that God delivered his typical people. Though they were disposed to complain of the lengthening out of their oppressions, yet their deliverance was not delayed one day. Eour hundred and thirty years to the day after Jehovah had made his covenant with their forefather, Abraham, he brought them forth. Let us be patient, then. Though some of our expectations as to what Jehovah would do at certain Biblically marked dates have not been realized, we may be sure that the plan of God, as revealed, is correct and will be worked out exactly on time. But with us, “Time is no more.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord caused the sea to go bach by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.—Exodus 14:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The arm of Jehovah is as strong today as it was at the deliverance of Israel at the Bed Sea. In an apostrophe to it Isaiah speaks for us today: “Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?” The day of grander deliverance is now come, both for the first-born ones of the Lord and for all people for whom Jesus died. Therefore can we take up the divindy inspired prayer: “Awake, awake, put on strength, 0 arm of the Lord; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it that hath cut Bahab, and wounded the dragon ?” And confident in the coming fulfilment of this Scriptural prayer, we can joyfully announce deliverance at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">September 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord went before by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Exodus 13:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“So didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name,” writes Isaiah (63:14). The glory of the Lord was manifest in the cloud. Seeing that there was an outward manifestation of God’s presence and favor upon his people when he brought them out of Egypt, many scriptures lead us to expect that the Lord will give some outward manifestation of his presence and favor to his faithful ones in the great impending conflict. It is very manifest that God intends his work to go forward to a full consummation, and that his remnant, who are the faithful ones, shall not again be scattered by evil powers or evil teachings. In shielding and preserving them from the enemy, God manifests his glory upon his own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">September 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">In the same day, the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates. — Genesis 15:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let it be settled in the mind of each one that when God Almighty makes a covenant that covenant will never be forgotten but that its provisions will certainly be fulfilled in God’s due time. Over two thousand years before Christ’s birth Jehovah promised to give Abraham and his seed the land of Palestine. What though Abraham still sleeps in the grave and has not yet taken possession of the land, the period of the typical jubilees expired in 1925 and the regathering of the natural seed of Abraham to their homeland is taking place before our eyes. The rebuilding of Palestine by the Jew is now well under way, and gives a most trustworthy assurance that God’s covenant will be made good to Abraham. This alone should command the respectful attention of everyone believing that Jehovah is God. It should strengthen our faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">September 12</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bless the Lord, 0 my soul; and all that is within me, bless his holy name.—Psalm 108:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Members of the temple class look back over the way which they have been led by the loving hand of the Lord, and exclaim: &quot;Bless the Lord, 0 my soul, and forget not all his benefits.” They are not able to remember all his benefits conferred upon them, but they do not wish to forget them all. The Psalmist here expresses the condition of heart enjoyed by the Servant class now on earth, expressing a realization of God’s nearness and the privileges he has afforded such to serve him. It expresses how faithful service to the Lord stirs them up to enthusiasm and gladness. Because of the limitations of the imperfect organism it is impossible for the servant to render perfect sendee, and he is constantly reminded of need and stimulus. God’s manifold goodness provides all needed help, and illicits praise from his lips.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">September 13</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and saorifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer. — Hebrews 8:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Has Jehovah ordained the new creature to sacrifice? No; the new creature does not sacrifice. He must perform his covenant with diligence, and that covenant is to do the will of God. Jehovah has ordained Christ Jesus the High Priest to offer up the consecrated ones as a part of his own sacrifice. The office of offering unto God falls to Christ Jesus. The part to be performed by the new creature, as an underpriest, is always to be ready and on the alert to do the will of God. Such is his reasonable service. It is the service that is reasonably required by his covenant. The performance of a reasonable service could not be a sacrifice on the part of the one rendering it. It is of the utmost and vital importance that every new creature in Christ Jesus carry out his reasonable service. The performance of service means the joyful obeying of God's commands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">September 14</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.—1 Thessalonians 4:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Holiness, unto which Jehovah has called us, is not merely a standard which the mind can reach up to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">endorse, but one which must be attained. Absolute holiness, within the meaning of the Scriptures, must be attained by the overcoming Christian on this side the veil. It means that he must be pure in his thoughts </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">words and actions, insofar as that is possible with his imperfect organism; but it means much more than this. It means a complete and absolute devotion to Jehovah’s cause, prompted by love for him; it means the faithful performance of the Christian’s covenant as a witness of the Lord. A Christian can, on this side the veil, refuse to sympathize with or support in any way </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">Devil’s organization; he can devote every faculty that he possesses to the support of God’s organization. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Dy </span><span class="font3">so doing he will attain to the standard of holiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">September 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">It pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief.—Isaiah 53:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was while engaged in furnishing the sin-offering for our iniquities that God’s loyal Son Jesus was bruised and put to grief with what would have crushed any other man. It was not the pain of Jesus’ heart or feeling or body that was pleasing to Jehovah. It was Jesus’ demonstration of trustful, uncomplaining submission and active obedience amidst this pain that gave God warm pleasure; and this demonstration could not be made unless Jehovah had permitted Jesus to encounter bruises and grief here in this world of sin. In such testing and perfecting of the obedience of his dearest Son there was no heartlessness on Jehovah’s part; “for it became him [Jehovah], for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">September 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lord, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, 0 Lord our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Chronicles 14:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is no restraint to Jehovah to save with many or with few. Jehovah has always won his battles with apparently overwhelming odds against his cause. This is because greater is he, the Almighty One, than all that can be arrayed against him and his. It is because Jehovah would have no one glory in man but reserves the glory of the victory for himself. Thereby he wisely guards his people from vaunting themselves against him, saying, “Mine own hand hath saved me.” This fact should humble us and make us realize that Jehovah does not need us to accomplish his work or to win his battles, but that he greatly honors us in granting us to enlist </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font3">his cause. This fact should also embolden us because, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">though </span><span class="font3">we have no power of ourselves and go forth against a multitude, we have Jehovah with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">September 17</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.—1 Samuel 2:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To Lucifer in Eden was entrusted the power of death with respect to man; hut the exigencies of the case caused Jehovah to intervene and to pronounce sentence upon Adam and to execute that death sentence upon him. In his justice and in vindication of the honor of his name and his word, Jehovah brought Adam down to the grave. In minor strains we praise this wonderful manifestation of his justice, but in melodies of faith and joy we praise him for his mercy and love in his good purposes to bring back and make the dead alive again. He spared not his Son from death, but by greatness of power brought him up again from the grave. By this he furnished the ransom for all that are in their graves, and gave assurance that in the fulness of his times he shall bring them up out of the tombs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">September 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1 will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.—Deuteronomy 18:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah will not for ever leave the groping masses of mankind to seek unto the observers of times, the diviners, the enchanters, the necromancers, and dergy of Satan’s dominion in their blind attempts to know the divine will and to get into harmony with the Supreme One. He has promised to raise up in their behalf a prophet of truth, who really represents Jehovah and is ordained to be mediator between God and man. He has put his words into the mouth of this prophet. By him he shall bring all the teachable out from under the deceptions of the evil one and his servants and unto an accurate knowledge of the truth. The Christ, Head and body, is this great Prophet and Mediator like unto, yet greater than, Moses. During the Christian era God has been gradually raising up this prophet. Soon membership in this mediatorial body will be complete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">To declare the name of the Lord in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem.—Psalm 102:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the time God looks down from heaven to give heed to the cries of the prisoners is also the time that those of Zion must declare the honor of his name in the earth. Organized religion, called Christendom, fails to give God true worship and honor </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font3"> his name. On the contrary, selfish men managing that system have sought to honor themselves. While doing this they have caused many to suffer. God has looked down from heaven, and begins to do for himself that which the professed servants of his have not done. He has gathered out a people for his name. It is his purpose now that his name shall be magnified in Zion and his praises go forth from Jerusalem. The time has now come when the faithful Servant class composing Zion must declare the honor of God’s name; and shortly there shall follow a song of praise sung by the great company class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">September 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. —Psalm 2:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The people vainly imagine that present world powers can bring their hearts’ desire by giving them a government of peace and happiness. At the same time the ruling factors of the present evil world take counsel together against Jehovah and against his anointed One. Their efforts will be in vain. The time has come that Jehovah has placed his King upon the throne. He has set him upon the “hill”, or highest position of authority relative to his kingdom. Ours is therefore a transition period; and it is a wonderful time for us to be on the earth. What a great privilege is ours to have some part in announcing to the sin-sick and suffering world that the King of glory is set upon his throne; and that soon the blessings, for which they have hoped, will be offered to mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I am the Lord which sanctify you.—Leviticus 20:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The word sanctification in Scripture usage properly means set apart for a holy purpose. The purpose of God is a holy one; namely, the selection of joint-heirs with Christ to reign with him in his kingdom for the blessing of all the families of the human race. All associated with Christ must be holy. Christ was holy, and everyone joined with him must be set apart to that holy purpose. Therefore anyone connected with this part of Jehovah’s great plan would have to be separated unto this holy purpose or work, be fully sanctified. In all this, however, Jehovah does not coerce anyone. Before appointing any to a position of glory, honor and immortality he enlists their willing and hearty cooperation by informing them of his plan for them and by setting before them joys and rewards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">September 22</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him he your fear, and let him he your dread. And he shall he for a sanctuary.—Isaiah 8:13, Ilf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The sanctuary is the holy place, the secret place of the Most High, and therefore the place of complete safety for Jehovah’s anointed Servant. The members of this Servant class see that the Lord of hosts has an army to do his bidding, and that he will protect those who are faithful and who joyfully continue to represent him. These anointed ones have made Jehovah alone their fear, and they fear no other, and to them the Lord is a sanctuary. Being in his sanctuary they dwell in the shadow of his almighty hand, and are wholly and completely safe. However, they do not consider themselves immune from the attacks of the enemy; they know that their safety depends entirely upon Jehovah’s strength, and that so long as they dwell in his secret place and abide under his almighty shadow, they are safe. Therefore they properly fear Jehovah and delight to sing forth the honor of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.—Psalm 107:</span><span class="font3"> 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The true Christians, although being in the world, find no abiding place here. Their citizenship is in heaven, because their affairs are directed from on high. For a long while these true saints were held in captivity to the Babylonish systems. That was a wilderness condition. God’s due time came to gather together unto him those who had made a covenant with him by sacrifice. These saints, hungering and thirsting for truth and sweet communion with others of like precious faith, cried unto the Lord, who heard their cry. He then led them forth out of captivity that they might journey to the blessed city of God’s kingdom. Now the true saints are going through the gates, that is to say, moving toward the kingdom; and with joy they are singing Jehovah’s praises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">September 24</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He came with ten thousands of saints. ... Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Deuteronomy 33:2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Moses told the people of Israel that were then before him that Jehovah loves them, and that the reason why he loves them is that he loves them (What better reason can anybody give for loving anybody that he truly loves ?) and because he would keep his promise to their fathers. It is easy to comprehend the reasons for God’s great love for his only-begotten Son, Jesus; but we, like Israel, do not find so many reasons for him to love us, his saints. Nevertheless, he does love us; and all the expressions of love to natural Israel come with peculiar force to apply to those whom natural Israel typified. For this reason the saints may unwaveringly trust Jehovah to hold them in the hollow of his hand as they now seek to proclaim the words which they received while sitting at his feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord fought for Israel.—Joshua 10: 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Because the cause of his people is really his cause, the Lord did the fighting; and more were they that fell as a result of the miraculous storm of hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword. Thus victory crowned the day for Israel. This reminds the Christians that the present fight is not their fight, but that it is really God’s fight against the Devil’s organization, and that in his due time he will clear out that organization completely. Happy are we that we do not have to fight with carnal weapons, but that this warfare means battling for the truth and standing firmly for the Lord under the most trying and adverse conditions, with full faith that if we abide in him we shall stand victorious with him at the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">September 26</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord: we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 118:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To come in the name of the Lord is to come in the power and glory of that name. Jesus Christ, the great Executive Officer and High Priest to the Most High God, comes in the name of his Father and by his power to deliver the church and the people. There is no possible question that the time of deliverance has come. He who is clothed with all power and authority will accomplish Jehovah’s purpose. Jehovah is the great Deliverer, acting by Christ Jesus to accomplish his will. The temple class hear these truths and greatly rejoice. The temple class, which is “that faithful and wise servant” to whom the kingdom interests are committed, come in the name and power of the Lord. Together they lift up the voice with singing to the honor of Jehovah’s name. They give forth their knowledge of God’s purpose and the people of earth who hear are blessed thereby. Blessed are they who have part in giving this witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">September 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ily sons, he not now negligent: 'for the Lord hath chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto him, and, burn incense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Chronicles 29:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Wondrous thought! We are not to be made ministers of the world; but Jehovah has chosen his sons, the anointed Christ, to stand before him to serve him; and their loving devotion rises upward to him as a sweet incense. God encourages his sons in diligence, and commands diligence. He looks with disfavor upon negligence. Diligence and fervency show a heart appreciation of God’s favors and a loving devotion to him. God’s sons are now, while on earth, to be diligent as witnesses that Jehovah is God. If they keep faithful to death, they will enter into Jehovah’s sanctuary to minister unto him, and be associated with his beloved Son in the reconstruction and blessing of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">September 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">All thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children.—Isaiah 51:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is the children of Zion, God’s organization, of whom Jehovah is the teacher. In the Psalms he encourages us with the promise: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font3"> will instruct thee, and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go.” These words cannot apply to the individual. No one can claim the precious promises until he becomes a member of the church. The promise is that Jehovah will teach his church. With this thought in mind let us remember that Jehovah will reveal to his church his great truth when he sees it is good for her to have the same. No man is entrusted with the interpretation of the Scriptures which contain Jehovah’s written teachings. The Scriptures are not of private interpretation. The Lord is his own interpreter, and he uses such instruments as he may choose to bring to the children of his organization the things that he desires them to have. What peace and assurance it gives us to know that we are being taught of Jehovah!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">September 29</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Nehemiah 9:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This is a testimony to God’s faithfulness in providing for the congregation of his people in the wilderness. About 1874 the true church began to announce the second coming of Christ Jesus and the setting up of his kingdom. This, of course, was in harmony with God’s will and was the command of the Lord. Then and there the saints began with zeal and energy their journey toward the kingdom. In 1914 they reached the mountain of God’s kingdom, from -whence the law of the new covenant will be proclaimed. During all the intervening forty years of journeying did the church lack anything? The experience of the church stands as a faithful monument of testimony: “They lacked nothing.’’ Then let not our faith in God’s providence for the future fail us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">September 30</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; . . . And Israel saw that great work which the Lord did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the Lord.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Exodus 11:30, 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After Jehovah had overthrown the hosts of Satan’s first world power, Egypt, in the Red Sea, a song of deliverance was sung unto the Lord, extolling the mercies of God. In a more wonderful sense will a song be sung when Jehovah has delivered mankind from the thraldom of Satan’s empire and has placed them upon the highway that they may journey back in holiness to endless peace and happiness. Then in a fuller sense may it be said: “Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation.” (Exodus 15:13) Then the people will reverence Jehovah with great awe for his act of deliverance. They will also respect God’s Prophet, the One like unto Moses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">October 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?—Job 38:22, 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has stored up great treasures of natural forces which he has used and still purposes to use in a supernatural way to glorify his name. In the visitation of the plagues upon the land of Egypt to effect the deliverance of his chosen people, he “sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground”. In fighting to victory for Israel at the city of Gibeon, he cast down great stones of hail upon the Canaanites and slew more therewith than the children of Israel slaughtered with carnal weapons. Jehovah purposes to be wroth again as in the valley of Gibeon; and against tha.t day of battle and war he has reserved his treasures of hail. He has decreed that “the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies”. Have you entered into the treasuries of the hail since the temple of God has been opened in heaven? Or have you withheld your hand?</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">My Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.—John 15:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has planted the Christ vine to accomplish his great work in the earth. He takes personal interest in the care of this vine. The fruit for which he is looking is not character so-called, nor is it the fruit of the spirit. It is really the outgrowth of having in us the fruit of the spirit, love. The chief office of a vine is to bear fruit that by its wine it may cheer God and man. (Judges 9:13) Correspondingly, Jehovah has planted his vine, the Christ company, that it may cheer him by its obedience in ‘showing forth the praises of him who hath called them out of darkness into' his marvelous light’; and also cheer men by bearing to them the knowledge of Jehovah and his glorious kingdom for making them everlastingly happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">October 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.—Acts 15:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The name of Jehovah as the God of justice, wisdom, love and power, has been called in question. He declares that in his own due time he will vindicate his name before all creation. Before he does this in its fulness, he will have a witness given in the earth concerning his purpose, because he will have notice served as to what he intends to do. To this end he visits the Gentiles, and out from them he takes a people upon whom he puts his spirit and clothes them with authority to appear in his name and speak in behalf of his cause. Today God is not in the thoughts of those who constitute the world. Now is God’s due time for notice to be served upon them of his intention and purpose. Whom will he use to perform this service? The people whom he has called out and anointed with his spirit and who are a people for his name. These are honored above all others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">October 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Arise, 0 Lord; let not man prevail; let the heathen be judged in thy sight. Put them in fear, 0 Lord;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">that the nations may know themselves to be but men.—Psalm 9:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The battle is being joined more closely day by day; and men, particularly the human ruling factors serving in the Devil’s organization, would, and verily think they can, prevail over the Lord’s cause. While they apparently do not recognize themselves to be but men of dust in God’s sight, yet God’s remnant should not forget that “the shepherds and the principal of their flock” are merely puny men. They should therefore not be ensnared by the fear of man but be bold and uncompromising in giving testimony to the rulers of the world as well as to the ruled. Man shall not prevail; but shortly God will arise .in his strength amid Armageddon’s tumult. He will display his power and supremacy in such awe-inspiring manner that the nations will fear and know themselves to be creatures of clay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">October 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory ? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.—Psalm 24: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now the time has come in which Satan’s wicked systems are to be dashed to pieces. The members of the church on earth do not do this destructive work. They are not the ones who will bind Satan and destroy his power. Matched against him they of themselves are too weak. Who will do this mighty work? The King of glory. Who is he? “Jehovah of hosts, he is the King of glory.” He is the Almighty One, stronger than the strong one, Satan. He never lost a battle. Beholding the King of glory majestically marching on to victory and to the deliverance of suffering humanity, God’s remnant cannot keep back their songs of elation and praise. Jehovah finds them joyfully willing to be used as his witnesses to make known the glories of his kingdom to the oppressed people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">October 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">When the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Exodus 16:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Each day of their journey Jehovah supplied Israel with his daily bread. It was a miraculous supply, coming from heaven, and in “a land of desert and pits; . . . a land of drought, and of the shadow of death; ... a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt”. Jehovah gave them of “the corn of heaven” and “every one did eat the bread of the mighty”. More miraculously yet, Jehovah has in a grander and more vital sense sent down bread from heaven. The Israelit-ish fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead. He that eats of this latter bread shall live for ever. Mankind does not know what it is; but the Lord’s Servant class has the privilege of announcing to starving mankind that it is Jesus, “the living bread.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Exodus 32:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Everything upon or about the two tables of the Mosaic law was of Jehovah. He is the one Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. On the stony tablets the finger of God wrote according to all the words which the Lord spake with Israel in the mount, out of the midst of the fire, in the day of their assembly there. Writing the law on stone did not effect any writing of it in the hearts of Israel; but the days come that Jehovah will put his law into the inward parts and they will not need to wear phylacteries bearing written portions of the law or to write them upon the posts of their houses, and on their gates. He will take away the heart of stone, and give mankind a heart of flesh and will write his law in their hearts. He will then be their God; and they will be his people, because his law will be enthroned in their hearts’ affection and they will keep it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">October 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. . . . My name is</span><span class="font3"> in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Exodus 23:20, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In all Jehovah’s dealings with his natural people, Israel, he used angels in an official or representative capacity. In the text above, the Lord Jehovah promised that his Executive Officer, invisible to the eyes of the host of Israel, would be their guardian and protector if they would obey him. Thus he foreshadows that his heavenly messengers are faithfully looking after the interests of spiritual Israel. They are the official friends of the church. When one of the Lord’s little ones goes forth in the proclamation of the King’s message, he may feel absolute rest and confidence in the Lord, because his official protector walks by his side to shield him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">October 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Deuteronomy 32:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord foreknows and provides for his own. He foreknew the natural seed of Abraham; and because he purposed to use them in making pictures of better things coming to the mass of humankind, he let his eyes fall on a land “Sowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all nations”. For their sakes he cared for it from one end of the year to the other. (Deuteronomy 11:12) He so disposed the habitations of the nations of earth that Israel might have it. He did so because he took Israel to him to be a peculiar treasure to him above all the peoples of the earth. The same God has prepared a fair habitation, the glory of the universe, for spiritual Israel, the new creation. He will permit no one to interfere with their getting it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">October 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners.—Psalm 20: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The time of trouble is on. God will help his people from the sanctuary of the temple. He will strengthen them out of Zion. They engage in his service to the glory of his name. They go forth to battle in his name and they set up their banners. A banner is a means to cheer those for whom it is set up and who rally about it. It is also a means of expressing defiance to the enemy. The anointed ones at this time clearly see that the great and final conflict with the forces of evil is rapidly approaching. It is their privilege to have a part therein by being witnesses to the name of Jehovah. In his name let them now set up their banners and be of good courage. So doing they will be found in his service strengthening themselves in the Lord and against the enemy. They will rally about their banners and encourage each other in honoring Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">October 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">When he bringeth again [margin] the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.—Hebrews 1:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The selection of The Stone., the anointing and the laying of the world’s foundation took place at the time of Jesus’ baptism in the Jordan. The laying in miniature of The Stone in Zion, the &quot;tried” and proven One, took place three and a half years thereafter, when Jesus presented himself to the Jews as their King. The evidence is therefore conclusive that God’s anointed King is The Stone and that the laying of The Stone is the presentation of the King to those over whom he is to rule. The fulfilment of all this in completion has come in our day. In 1914 Jesus began his activity as priest of the Most High God and as the anointed King. In 1918 he came to his temple; and to all professed spiritual Israelites Jehovah offered him as King. Since then Jehovah commands even the angels to worship him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Christ Jesus, ... of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Corinthians 1: 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has made Christ Jesus wisdom unto us in two ways, viz., by precept and by example. As Spokesman of Jehovah the Lord Jesus gives precepts. He also took the proper course, leaving us the example that we are to follow in his steps. Our justification from Jehovah comes because of the imputed merit of Jesus, who as High Priest presents us to God; and thus is he made righteousness unto us. The justified ones Jehovah begets by his spirit and anoints them by receiving them into the body of Christ, thus sanctifying them to his own use. The standing, an instantaneous one, of the anointed ones is in Christ Jesus; and thereby he is made unto us sanctification. By pursuing the wise and faithful course in Jesus’ footsteps we shall become conformed to his image, and Jehovah will raise us up </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">by him</span><span class="font3"> in the first resurrection. Thus Jesus is made redemption unto us.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Then will 1 turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent.—Zephaniah 8:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The whole world lieth in the wicked one”; and as he speaks, so it speaks. The ruling factors speak a language of lies and religious hypocrisy to the people. The people speak a language of hate, jealousy, fear, pride, malice, envy, vanity, and false religion to one another. They draw near to God with sanctimonious language and call upon him; but their language is impure and foreign to him because their hearts are estranged from him. After the fire of Jehovah’s jealousy has devoured the visible earthly organization of Satan, then the Lord’s kingdom shall purify the people and. convert their language, their methods of intercourse, to a pure form by bringing them all to a knowledge of the truth. They shall learn to love Jehovah, and serve him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">October 14</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He suffered no man to do them wrong; yea, he reproved kings for their sakes; saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 105:14, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This has been the course of Jehovah from the days of Abraham and the patriarchs down to the present. Till their work is done he preserves those whom he has anointed and made his prophets, his mouthpieces. His preservation of the anointed class, the Christ company, during the Christian era has been nothing short of miraculous. Jehovah has not considered even the mighty kings of earth above deserving reproof when it comes to touching injuriously those whom he tenderly regards as the apple of his eye. God’s unfolding Word shows that his anointed mouthpieces must at this time, and before Armageddon breaks, deliver a testimony to the rulers of the world order. They should not be abashed at the austerity or the outward dignity of these earthly potentates, because the Lord purposes to punish the high ones and the kings; but his faithful witnesses he protects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I heard, the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us ? Then said I, Here am</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I; send me.—Isaiah 6:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Paul asks the question: “How shall they preach, except they be sent?” It is God who sends the messengers of truth. When Isaiah had the vision of the Lord in his temple, he cried out: “Woe is me 1 for I am undone.” It seems clear that his uncleanness, which he confessed, had something to do with the words of his mouth, or rather words which he had failed to  speak. He recognized that he ought to be praising God, as the seraphim were doing. His penitent cry led to purgation. Isaiah’s mouth was cleansed by a live coal of fire taken off the altar. This indicates that in harmony with the work done by the Refiner since 1918 in refining the sons of Levi, their lips were purged; that is, the temple class was awakened to the fact that greater activity should be manifested in representing the Lord. Thereupon they zealously manifested their willingness to be sent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">October 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 110:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah took Jesus away from earth, the place of activity of his enemies, and seated him in the position of favor in heaven. The enemy Satan continued his nefarious operations without interference, but this was to be permitted only until a fixed time in the Father’s plan. Jesus, of course, observed the efforts of the enemy • but he must patiently wait upon the Father until the due time to act. He possessed all power in heaven and in earth, but he was not to use it against the Devil until the order for action came from Jehovah. In 1914 the time limit expired, and then Jehovah authorized the Lord </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus </span><span class="font3">to cast the Devil and his angels out of heaven and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">down </span><span class="font3">to the earth, God’s footstool. Very soon he will </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">triumph </span><span class="font3">in Armageddon’s conflict, and then the Lord </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">will </span><span class="font3">begin the stupendous work of restoring humankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">For  this cause will I confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.—Romans 15:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The apostle here quotes from the Psalmist. This text is in fact a prophecy being fulfilled now by the Servant class on earth who are giving a witness to the nations. The name of Jehovah was declared to the Jews and also to the Gentiles by Paul and others of his day. But the great witness of which the Psalmist speaks, and which the apostle quotes (Psalm 18:49), undoubtedly refers to the witness to be given during the second presence of Christ and refers to the same time and message mentioned by Jesus when he said: 'This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached to all nations as a witness.’ (Matthew 24:14) Now is the time for the fulfilment of the prophecy in completeness. It is to the “faithful and wise servant” class that the privilege is now given to sing forth the honor of God’s name to the nations of earth and thus serve as his witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">October 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my highness.—Isaiah 13:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These ones are sanctified through the blood of Jesus, set aside for God’s holy purposes, made mighty through the Lord because of having on the armor of God, and are soldiers under a Captain who knows no defeat. They are called to be associated with their Head in declaring God’s vengeance. They rejoice in Jehovah’s highness, and at the same time are impressed profoundly with their own and other men’s littleness. Clearly Jehovah’s command rings in their ears: “Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain!” This means to lift up the message announcing the King and his kingdom. “Exalt the voice unto them, wave the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.” That is, use your voice and the might of your hands in earnestly and clearly proclaiming the' message to all that have hearing ears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">October 19</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Gfod hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.—Romans 11:32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ab we view the varied features of Jehovah’s plan, we exclaim in the language of the Apostle Paul: “0 the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!” For centuries now the Jews as a nation have been shut up in unbelief, that God’s tender mercies in the way of kingdom favors and opportunities might be extended to the Gentiles. God is under no obligation to the Jews, and yet he has arranged that his mercies on those whom he calls to the kingdom from the Gentiles should rebound in mercies upon Israel when he removes Israel’s blindness. The time for showing mercy upon Israel at the hands of the kingdom class is now begun. God has given us a message of comfort and enlightenment for Israel. Let us who have received God’s mercies proclaim it to the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">October 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, . . . be glory and majesty, dominion and power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Jude 24, 25. 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Likely our guardian angels, who have ministered to us as heirs of salvation, will be the first to greet us beyond the vail. That will be a happy meeting. Doubtless these angels will instruct us with reference to being presented to Jehovah, because they have access to the courts of heaven. Then will follow the “general assembly [of the] church of the firstborn”, whose names are written in heaven, when we shall meet our “altogether lovely” Bridegroom. Finally will come the crowning experience, the granting of the “one thing [we] have desired of the Lord”; for the Lord Jesus will present us without spot and faultless before the throne of God and we shall “'behold the beauty of Jehovah”, the great, strong and loving One who has ever kept us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God hath chosen the foolish things of the world, to  confound the wise; .. . and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Corinthians 1:27, 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Sometimes the question is asked: Why is it that persons of slight education in the ordinary walks of life, who have no particular influence among men, would even pretend to present the message of truth? And why is it that, when they do, it is clearly and lucidly presented and puts to flight and to shame the learned theologians who are professed followers of the Lord ? God's own Word answers: It is because Jehovah has chosen them and has put his words into their mouths; and his spirit, operating on their minds and hearts, makes them bold and strong in the Lord, with the ability to make clear the message of the truth now revealed. Jehovah charges them: “Speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces.”—Jeremiah 1:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">October 22</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel.—Isaiah 11:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An ensign means a flag or signal, banner or beacon, which is a token of relief or deliverance. This text shows that when the inhabitants of the earth are in distress and perplexity, when the storms of adversity are beating upon the people and they mourn and cry unto the Lord for relief, Jehovah will set up an ensign for the people of the nations. This ensign or beacon light is the Christ and his message of the kingdom for the deliverance and blessing of mankind. He is the embodiment of light and truth, and is crowding the enemy to the wall, and soon will make known to the world the complete victory of truth. Now he is raising the ensign of truth for the benefit of those that have a desire for righteousness, that they may be safely led over the dark morass into paths of light and truth. Blessed are the saints whom he uses to deliver the glad message now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">October 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in, from this time forth, and even for evermore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 121:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord. Jehovah hereby encourages his children to trust confidently in him, to keep themselves in his love and to hold fast that which they have. It would be reasonable to look forward to a time when error would no longer be permitted to blind God’s people, and to expect that that time would come during the presence of the Lord Jesus, at his appearing to claim his own. The Psalmist evidently refers to this time when he wrote: “The rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.” To that end Jehovah specially guards his Servant class since 1918; for then the great adversary, cast out of heaven, had come down to earth, having great wrath. From that time forth Jehovah preserves them as they go in and out in his service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">October 24</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence!—Isaiah 61:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We are entering a fearful and wonderful time. The hour for the great battle of God Almighty against his enemy is approaching. Satan seems to have learned little or nothing by his former experiences. Blinded by him the nations give no heed to Jehovah, to his Word, or to his works. Therefore the nations shall waste before him. He will make his truth and power to be known. Then all nations will tremble at his presence. Then many will remember the words which God caused to be spoken by his servants. It is to be expected now that the dark hours will come when seemingly the enemy has the upper hand. God may permit just such things to test the faith of his people. Let no true child of God be discouraged, however, but like Abraham, strong in faith, continue to give glory to God. With full confidence in Jehovah and in the power of his might, let each one go forth in his service, obeying his commands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.—James 1:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah is “the only wise God”. To his spirit-begotten ones he says: “Be not wise in thine own eyes;” “My son, attend unto my wisdom.” The sincere Christian desiring to keep this counsel and to grow in wisdom, is instructed to go to Jehovah in prayer, believing that he will reward him, asking in faith through the merit of Christ Jesus; then he must study the Word of God and diligently apply his mind and heart to gain a knowledge thereof. Every question that may arise in his mind concerning his course he will find answered according to the fixed rules of the Lord as set forth in the Bible. And rendering himself in obedience to the commandments and fixed rules of Jehovah will make him wise according to the divine standard. “The wise shall inherit glory.”—Proverbs 3: 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">October 26</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Who maketh his angels spirits: his ministers a flaming fire.—Psalm 104:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God made the angelic beings. They must be lovable spirit creatures, fair to behold, and gloriously imaging their heavenly Father, so that he is well pleased to grant them access to behold his face. The revealed record shows that he sends angels on important missions as his messengers and ambassadors, to represent his cause and to act as executive officers in the carrying out of his holy will. Once he sent an angel to appear unto Moses as a flaming fire and delivered a message of coming deliverance. It should thrill the heart of man to realize and appreciate that angels are not mere myths, but are mighty creatures, acting in an official capacity in carrying out God’s orders; and that men who devote themselves to the Lord are privileged to be used with these invisible and mighty ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 110:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The rod is the sceptre of authority and power rightfully reposed in Jehovah’s beloved Son. Jehovah sent the rod out of Zion, his organization, in 1914; whereupon Jesus Christ, the King, stood up and assumed his power and authority and began his reign even while his enemies were and still are exercising power, although their right thus to do has expired. Necessarily this marked the beginning of the battle in heaven by God’s loyal Son and his angels on one side, and Satan, the old Dragon, and his angels on the other side. It is the fight of God Almighty in heaven against the Devil, God’s forces being led by his beloved Son. The purpose is to subdue the enemy and make them the footstool of Jesus Christ the King. “Therefore rejoice, ye heavens,” and let saints on earth catch up the rejoicing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">October 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">No man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.—Hebrews 5:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has called or designated Jesus as an High Priest of the Melchizedekian order. Our Savior is therefore the Head of the royal priesthood. He did not place himself in that position. “Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, today have I begotten thee.” Mel-chizedek was a priest of the great Most High, and pictures the One who is higher than the Levitical priesthood and the real blesser of Abraham. He is fittingly a picture, therefore, of the great Executor of the divine plan. The church, by virtue of its Head, is a part of the Melchizedek priesthood. God has called them to this honorable station. Faithfulness now in the performance of their duties gives assurance that they shall be members of this glorious priestly order for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet.—Jeremiah 6:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Amongst all the consecrated, spirit-begotten ones who compose Jehovah’s organization on earth, represented by Jerusalem, there is a faithful “remnant” class who because of their course of conduct are called watchmen. They are the ones who are wholly devoted to the Lord and who have their heart set upon the establishment of his kingdom. They are not particular about conventionalities and daily formalities, knowing that these do not prepare them for the kingdom. They are concerned with watching the movements of the Lord and with diligently performing their part of the covenant entered into with God, that they might glorify him and have his approval. They are of that class of “young men [who] see visions” of what Jehovah is doing and wants done. They are unselfishly interested in the welfare of their spiritual brethren, and sound the trumpet of the Lord’s Word to warn them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">October 30</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. —Romans 12:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah is the only one who has the authority to inflict punishment. His spirit does not authorize any one Christian to act as a prosecuting or a persecuting officer of another in the body of Christ. Not even has an ecclesia of the Lord’s people the right delegated to it to impose punishment. Jehovah has reserved this power to himself. If then there is evidence that one is begotten and anointed of the holy spirit, let everyone hesitate to act hastily in punishing that brother. For instance, some will go to a meeting of the Lord’s people with the determination to humiliate a brother by relegating him to a position of inferiority or inactivity. Such is not the spirit of the Lord. The Lord said: “Touch not mine anointed.’’ Degradation or promotion comes from Jehovah.—Psalm 75:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Malachi 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In 1918 the Lord came to his temple and began to prepare his treasure, which is the temple class. Following that time millions of people have come in contact with the message of truth. Great numbers have expressed their desire for God’s righteous kingdom, thereby showing their fear of the Lord. Their heart’s desire is noted by the Lord, as this text indicates; and a book of remembrance is kept concerning them that fear the Lord and think upon his name. That class must be separate and distinct from the temple class. But it is the temple class that is commissioned to carry the message of God’s kingdom to others that they might think upon God’s name and fear him. How then could one be faithful and true to the Lord now unless he avails himself of the opportunities offered for a part in the witness that bears honor to Jehovah’s name?</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark286"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark287"></a>November 1</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.—Hebrews 5:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah appointed Melchisedec as his high priest on earth without regard to parentage. This priesthood was ‘‘without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life”. Melchisedec was designated as “priest of the most high God”. Priest means chief executive or principal officer. Melchisedec was therefore a foreshadowing of God’s principal officer, the Logos, the anointed Jesus, and Jesus Christ in glory ; for the Logos was the beginning of God’s creation and there is no record of the time of that creation. He has always been the chief or principal executive of Jehovah, who has called him by the title of “priest after the order of Melchisedec”. His work is not confined to the Millennial age, but he will be Chief Officer of Jehovah for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I will bless them that Hess thee, and curse him that curs-eth thee; and in thee shall all families of the earth</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">be blessed.—Genesis 12:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this text Abraham pictures Jehovah, from whom the blessing of all creatures descends. Here is Jehovah’s unqualified declaration of his purpose to produce a seed through which he will bless all the families of the earth, even Abraham included. The mere fact that therein we find the expression of the divine will is conclusive proof that the same will be carried out to the letter and spirit regardless of what any of God’s creatures might do. The Abrahamic promise is a unilateral covenant, which means that its accomplishment by JehoVah does not depend upon whether any one else performs. It is Jehovah’s work. God gave his word and his oath, and beyond his word there is no controversy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">November 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord gave the word; great was the company of those that published it.—Psalm 68:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Having bidden the nations to cease warring and be silent till the Elisha work is done, Jehovah gave the word; that is, the message that Christ’s kingdom is now established and that the King is here to bless. What shall his anointed company do with this word which he has spoken ? The scripture replies: “The Lord God hath spoken, who can but prophecy?” How then can we hold back from publishing the word spoken? How can we clear ourselves of our responsibilities except that we prophesy and preach this gospel of the kingdom in all the world for a witness unto all nations ? The proclamation does not wait upon any individuals: it “shall be preached”, Jesus said. Let us take the matter to heart, and joyfully avail ourselves of the opportunity and be among the myriads of the Elisha company that publish the word that Jehovah, and not man, has given. Tell it out with joy as wise virgins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son.—John 5:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Judgment means a judicial determination. The one to whom judgment is committed must have authority and jurisdiction to hear all cases and to enter a finding or decree and to execute that decree. Jehovah has committed all judgment unto his Son. The Son, as earth’s new King, has assumed power and authority, and is binding the kings and the nobles. His judicial decree upon those who resist the increase of his kingdom will be destruction. As he sits upon the throne of glory in the temple of God, he also judges and refines the members of the temple class. During the Millennium he will judge the people of earth. He will hear their causes, determine as judge what shall be done, pronounce the decree, and enforce it. As a result of his judgment earth’s inhabitants shall learn righteousness. The overcoming saints shall participate in this worthy work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">November 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed.—Genesis 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was God’s purpose from the beginning to use his beloved Son to destroy the works of his disloyal, treacherous son. It was Jehovah who put or decreed enmity between the serpent-like organization of Satan and God’s organization typified by the woman. God’s bare announcement of his determination to annihilate the evil one fanned to a furious flame the enmity of Satan; and God simultaneously laid down the rale that his servants, the seed of the woman, shall not love the great adversary or anything that pertains to him. “Whosoever . . . will be a friend of the world [the Serpent’s system] is the enemy of God.” Under the feet of only his true friends and lovers will God eventually accomplish his work of bruising Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.—Isaiah 1:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Originally Jehovah planted the church a pure vine. The Word of the Lord was her standard of judgment; and the writings of God’s inspired witnesses, the prophets and the apostles, were the source of her counsels. The religious system that later grew up degenerated into a strange vine, unrecognizable by the Lord. In Christendom, which claimed to be the city of the Lord, the unfaithful shepherds and the principal of the flock rejected the judgments and counsels of the Lord’s Word. Both true Christians and the people have suffered as a result. But now the times of restoration have come. The Elijah work has been accomplished; and by this work Jehovah has restored to their original authority and position in Zion, his city, the judgments and counsels of his sacred Word. Zion is now the faithful city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">November 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world.—John 17:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Israelites fell into sin and became a part of the world system. Jesus carried a message from his Father to those professing to be God’s people. To those who had ears to hear, his words became life to them. They belonged to Jehovah, and he gave them to Jesus and his disciples, and to them Jesus made known the name and purpose of his Father, which in due time they fully understood. They were brought into the same relationship with God which Jesus enjoyed, and made partakers of the covenant for the kingdom. All of the temple class now enjoy that blessed relationship with the Father. All who remain faithful in keeping the Word of Jehovah will do his holy will and will continue to dwell in his secret place. Now it is God’s expressed will that all of the temple class shall go forth and make known his name to all who have ears to hear. There is no alternative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore ye</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that 1 am God.—Isaiah</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The day is here when the Lord will make his name Jehovah stand forth in glory and majesty before the eyes of all nations. He will perform his strange work “that men may know that thou, whose name alone is Jehovah, art the Most High over all the earth”. His announced purpose was to have competent witnesses in the earth to give faithful testimony before the great climax of the ages is reached. For this purpose he has separated his people from all strange gods, and has made his name first known unto them. He has taken his witnesses into intimate relationship with himself, declaring his counsels unto them, clothing them with the garments of salvation, and showing unto them the power of his works. Thus they are qualified as his witnesses, thoroughly reliable and able to speak with authority,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">November 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him.—Genesis</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation. (2 Peter 2:9) Enoch, because of his faith in God, was an outstanding figure in the midst of the religious hypocrisy and infidelity of his day. He was a witness on the earth for God. Satan the Devil had the power of death, and without doubt would have killed Enoch; but God prevented. The Devil had nothing to do with putting Enoch to death; nor did Enoch die because of sickness, the result of the inheritance from Adam, his forefather; nor did Jehovah put him to death for any wrongful act on Enoch’s part. While he was in the vigor of youth, and while he walked with God and joyfully conformed himself to God’s righteous law, the Lord manifested his pleasure in Enoch’s faith by talking him away, whither no one knows, from the scene of temptation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I raised thee up .. . that my name may he declared throughout all the earth.—Exodus 9:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was of the Lord Jehovah that the heart of the autocratic ruler of Egypt was hardened. God’s mercy in giving respite from the plagues should have softened Pharaoh’s heart; but the effect of this remission was just the opposite; Pharaoh selfishly tried to take advantage of Jehovah’s forbearance, and hardened his heart against the mercies of God. As a result Israel’s deliverance was delayed; but Jehovah used the occasion to magnify his power and to prove painfully, yet convincingly, that Jehovah is the name of the true God of heaven and earth. The Lord’s people now in the earth should not grow discouraged because Satan’s servants continue to harden their hearts and the deliverance of the church and the people is delayed apparently. Jehovah permits this that he may multiply his signs and wonders in earth and testify in his overwhelming demonstration amid the battle of Armageddon that he is God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">November 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through Icings in the day of his wrath.—Psalm 110:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The armies of the two contending forces are ranging up for the greatest of all conflicts, the battle of Armageddon. Jehovah is at the right hand of the Field Marshal of his appointment, lending him his fullest support. He undertakes the work of subduing the enemy, and in doing so he uses Christ Jesus as his great Arm and Power to plunge through and smash the stoutlooking battle lines of the foe. Thereat those who during long centuries past have led mankind into captivity themselves go into captivity. Meantime Jehovah has stationed his Servant class in the forefront of the consecrated ones this side of the vail. They do not strike </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">blow; but their part in the battle is to sing in the hearing of friend and foe, saying, “Praise the Lord; for his mercy endureth for ever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">November 12</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Hath not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?—James 2:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This does not mean that one must be poor in order for Jehovah to choose him, but he must possess something else. He must be rich in another way. He must possess the riches of faith. In order to have faith he must have a reverential mind; for “the reverence of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom”. The natural course will then be to seek a knowledge of the Lord. As one increases in knowledge of the Lord’s Word, he will increase in confidence in it; and thus will his faith grow. When he has an abundance of faith, a copious supply of it, he may be said to be rich in faith. If he becomes an heir of the kingdom these riches of faith must increase. His treasure, then, is in doing the Lord’s will; and in this he delights. There is where his love, his affection, is. What great condescension of Jehovah to choose the poor of this world and to make them heirs of the promised kingdom 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">November 13</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Galatians 4:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Father means life-giver. The realization that one has life brings joy of heart with gratitude and thankfulness to the Giver. The ideal relationship between the father, the life-giver, and the son is a sweet and blessed one. There is a perfect confidence on both sides. There is true fellowship between them. Each delights in the other. We have become sons of God because Jehovah has freely justified us upon the basis of the precious blood of Jesus Christ and has begotten us by his spirit, thus adopting us into the house of sons, if so be that we continue to fulfil our covenant, rejoicing in the hope even to the end. Now we can truly and delightedly say: “Jehovah, thou art my Father; and thy will I delight to do.” This spirit of sonship impels us to look about earnestly to see what we can do to glorify his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">They that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.—Psalm 9:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the time the Lord comes to his temple he sets judgment in the earth upon the nations. The time of trouble is on and God’s faithful witnesses must proclaim his holy name. This Psalm refers to that time. Satan goes forth to make war against the remnant who keep the commandments of God, and he rages against them. But being the people of the Lord they rest in security of Jehovah. They know Jehovah’s name and his purpose concerning them, and they put their trust in him. They know he will not forsake them, because he always keeps his covenant. They counsel each other, and continually remind one another that they are in the secret place of the Most High, free from all harm. With joy they sing forth the honor of his name; and by so doing their 'appreciation of the blessed opportunity of serving God ever increases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">November 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord hath chosen Zion: he hath desired it for his habitation.—Psalm 132:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For Jehovah to desire a thing means that in due time that thing shall exist. In due time he founded Zion in his faithful Son Jesus and chose it, having desired it for his habitation. Habitation means a site or seat of government, a permanent place of operation. Such Zion is; for it is Jehovah’s organization for the purpose of carrying into effect the various provisions of the divine plan. Thus in poetic phrase the Lord’s prophet states that God’s seat of government for the establishment of order in the earth, and for the gathering together of all things in heaven and in earth under one head, is Zion. Hence the church, now in the pinnacle of her earthly experience, is no longer in doubt as to the Lord’s purposes towards all his creatures; but she exercises herself that she might eventually stand victorious with Christ Jesus on Mount Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.—2 Tim. 4:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Christian finds it necessary to battle unceasingly against the unholy influences of the world. He is misunderstood by his friends, and deliberately misrepresented by his enemies. At times he finds himself standing seemingly alone; all have forsaken him except the Lord. He must fight on, consoled with the assurance that many indeed are the afflictions of the righteous, yet these afflictions shall not prevail over the faithful but Jehovah will deliver him out of them all when the time is ripe. For Jehovah is true to his side of the contract. Having called us to his kingdom and glory, he will preserve through the hottest of the conflict those who enthrone him in the chiefest place in their affections and who make it their effort unto the end to please and glorify him. Courage, then; the church approaches the last stages of the battle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">November 17</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.—Hebrews 12: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s love is of the rare sort that does not hesitate to chastise, to wound deeply, if thereby the loved one is to be brought to a proper course. When about to send fleshly Israel into the seventy years’ captivity, he does not hesitate to say, “I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.” Throughout the Christian era Jehovah’s little ones have been chosen and have been undergoing testing as to their faithfulness and love. Their journey has been through a vale of tears. But amidst all the trials and tears that have lined them pathway, Jehovah has exercised his loving powerin their behalf, turning their sorrow and tears into joy, and proving throughout that they are his sons. His love planned it all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—James 1:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This begetting is likened unto a contract. At the time one is justified and accepted as a part of the sacrifice of our Lord, he is begotten by the holy spirit. For God to will means for him to exercise his power; therefore, it is the power of God, or his will in action through his Word, by which the begetting is accomplished. By his Word he brings to Christ one who desires a knowledge of the truth. Such a one sees his privilege of making a consecration to do God’s will. Voluntarily submitting himself to the exercise of the will of God, and having faith in the merit of Christ Jesus, he is received and justified. God’s will is that the right of such a one to live as a man shall cease; and that there shall begin in him a newness of life, that is to say, a life upon the spirit plane. Begetting means beginning, and the exercise of Jehovah’s will begins the new creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">November 19</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thanks unto the Father, which hath made its meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Colossians 1:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah is the Father of lights. How variegated these lights must be we can slightly apprehend in that dyemakers have been able to make thousands upon thousands of variations of color, each color representing a hue of light. Wonderful and entrancing beyond degree must be the light in which Jehovah dwelleth! In that place of light he hath prepared an inheritance for his saints. No man can approach unto this light, so radiant is it; but Jehovah has made his saints meet for their inheritance in light by translating them now out of darkness into the kingdom of his dear Son. When their earthly course is run, he will usher them into their inheritance by resurrecting them as divine characters of light. Let us then give thanks unto the Father, and faithfully “walk in the light, as he is in the light!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">November 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord . . . satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 103:2,5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pointing forward to our day the Prophet Daniel wrote: “Oh, the blessedness of him that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days!” Are we not blessed? Has not the Lord satisfied our mouths with good things, even the most precious things of his Word? How much more true is God’s promise since the Lord has come to his temple and has bidden the faithful members thereof to enter into his joy! The strength of those who had been engaged in the Elijah work needed to be renewed, that they might be adequate to the requirements of the-strenuous Elisha work that lay before them. Jehovah duly renewed our strength. He gave brighter vision; he put his choice Word into our mouths, and has made us as youths again, strong, vigorous and clear-eyed like the eagle. Shall not our soul and all that is within us bless God out of Zion ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">November 21</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.—Proverbs 18:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To the faithful Israelites the name of Jehovah was an integral part of his covenant. He who trusted in that name and was faithful was safe from the attack of the enemy. To trust in God’s name means to do the will of Jehovah, and those who trust in his name do his will. God’s promises are sure. In times of stress the fact that the child of God is in a covenant with Jehovah is to him a strong tower, a place of shelter and of safe retreat. The servant of God, knowing this, with full confidence goes forth in his service and has no fear that evil shall befall him. Joyfully he says: “In God I will praise his word; in God I have put my trust: I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.” (Psalm 56:4) The Lord has provided opportunities for his children to serve him, and provides complete protection while they are serving. He rewards the faithful ones who honor his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">There is no power 'but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.—Bomans 13:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Most High is the name Jehovah takes to signify his purpose toward all creation. It refers to him as Supreme Ruler over all powers and principalities. In him reside all power and authority. Anything and everything that is held in possession by any creature is from and subject to the will of the Most High. It is plain therefore that “the powers that be” could have no power except Jehovah ordained or arranged to permit it. He is above all. There is none like unto him, and no power can prevent him from carrying out his will. The name Most High bespeaks supremacy over all, the One to whom all governments, powers and creatures must be in subjection. He is the Author, the Maker, the Executor and the Finisher of the great divine plan. He is also the Head of The Christ, the new creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">November 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places.—Psalm 18:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The sure-footed hind climbs to the highest and most rugged parts of the mountain peak, and looks over the precipice with calmness and serenity, and is not at all confused. Similarly with the faithful Christian who is now honored by Jehovah; he sees that he is highly honored and exalted in being made a witness for Jehovah; but this does not cause him to topple over, for he trusts in God and not in man. He looks down from his high station upon the elements of the earth warring with each other and marks the oncoming of the forces of the Devil to Armageddon. He is calm, trustful and serene; and his feet are sure and steadfast like hinds’ feet. Though everything that is committed to him is in a weak, earthen vessel, yet he knows that his strength comes from Jehovah, his shield and his protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He hath shewed his people the power of his works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 111: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">His people are members of The Christ, God’s new creation. These favored and faithful ones have been privileged to see the power of the works of Jehovah in advance of others. There must be a reason why. The Psalmist gives the reason: “That he may give them the heritage of the nations.” The greatest blessing that could come to any one is to be made a member of the royal family of heaven. But members of the anointed class should always keep in mind that before God will exalt them to heavenly power and glory they must be gladly submissive to him and must prove their faithfulness by loving and joyful devotion to the Lord. For this reason the “servant” class now see that it is of utmost importance to the Christian to be diligently engaged in the Lord’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">November 25</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah hath . . . made my mouth like a sharp sword. —Isaiah</span><span class="font3"> 49:1,</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The “servant” class must plainly declare the truth, which truth serves as a sharp sword and as a polished shaft directed against the enemy of the Lord. Let no one construe this to mean that harsh and vindictive speech is authorized. Those of Jehovah’s “servant” class tell the truth in the spirit of the Lord; and the truth, sharp as a two-edged sword and like a piercing shaft, accomplishes the purposes of God. It is manifest then that those who bear witness are to use no carnal weapons to accomplish destructive work. The “faithful and wise servant” class will tell the people plainly of Satan’s wicked organization, and that Jehovah is God and that through his organization complete deliverance shall come. All members of Jehovah’s elect Servant will join in this proclamation as opportunity is afforded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall he no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Revelation 21:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah God through The Christ will dwell with the people, and they will he his people and he will he their God. The kingdom of Messiah will be God’s kingdom because it will be the outworking of the great divine plan. There will be some trials in the kingdom for the peoples of the earth, but as they learn obedience Jehovah will wipe away their tears. The peoples of earth, who give their unqualified allegiance to the new government, will find their citizenship in the new and holy city, and will reeignize Jehovah as their God and themselves as his people. Those who pursue the course of holiness will finally pass completely over the highway and be fully restored, and will become a part of that grand hallelujah chorus which shall for ever sing Jehovah’s praises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">November 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Peter 2: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Each Christian was once in darkness, even as the world is in darkness; but now Jehovah has brought him out of darkness into a really marvelous light, forasmuch as in that light he sees things which the natural man cannot perceive. However, the mere fact that a member of the church has been translated out of darkness does not mean that he will not continue to have a battle with the powers of darkness. There is a battleground now evistent in his mind; and he must needs fight against principalities, powers, and the rulers of the darkness of this world. He must avail himself of the provision Jehovah has made to keep him in the light, and thus walk in the light. He must also turn the rays of this light outward from himself and reflect it upon others, because everything in harmony with Jehovah, the great Source of light, must shine out like him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">November 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">We will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.—Micah</span><span class="font3"> 4:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These words express the unalterable determination of his people to walk in the name of their Father from a time certain and for ever thereafter. That time is when the anointed are in the secret place of the Most High and abiding under the hand of the Almighty. They see that the time has come for Jehovah to take action looking to the destruction of all such in opposition to him and his people. From that time forward the anointed ones can walk in righteousness and truth, knowing that God will not permit his faithful ones to be confounded by the deceit of the evil one. From henceforth no institution set up against God’s anointed ones shall prosper. They may apparently seem to triumph for awhile, but they shall not triumph. There is great need for full assurance now; and God has graciously provided it. Let all who love him boldly proclaim the honor of his holy name henceforth and for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">November 29</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love; he will joy over thee with singing.—Zephaniah 3:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since the pouring out of his spirit on his servants and handmaids and the coming of the “Adonai” to his temple, Jehovah is in a special sense in the midst of his people. The vicious Dragon would harm those who keep God’s commandments, but Jehovah protects them like the mountains round about Jerusalem and promises early to deliver them. Jehovah’s love for them is not the demonstrative, shallow kind. It is the deep love that floweth like a river. He will rest, that is, “be silent” (margin), while his plans of love are working out. He will rejoice when they come to fruition. Everybody in heaven and in earth will rejoice then, even including the Father himself, who will joy unto the point of singing. Then God will be “all in all”, everything to everybody. Then all will be God’s family, united for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to hattie; . . . and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not he cut off from the city.—Zechariah 14:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All the nations of the earth belong to Satan’s organization. Jehovah God is gathering them against Jerusalem, his organization; because he is choosing their delusions for them, having decreed that the time of their destruction has come. As Joshua of old wrote: “It was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favor.” Under the stress of the assault against those who take their stand on the Lord’s side, a part, and doubtless the greater part, shall fall to the enemy. The remnant will refuse to budge from their position of complete devotion to Jehovah. They shall have his protection and be delivered.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I will come near to you to judgment; and I will he a swift witness against the sorcerers, . . . and against those that . . . fear not me, saith the Lord of hosts.—Malachi 3:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has come near to judgment against nominal spiritual Israel, Christendom, in that his Son, the Lord whom they confess to seek after, has come to his temple to cleanse it. The judgment is not limited to the antitypical priests, the “sons of Levi”. It extends to the entire religious system which calls itself by the name of the Lord. The sorcerers, the adulterers, the false swearers, the oppressors of the hireling and the widow and the fatherless, and the defrauders of the stranger of his right, draw near in their sanctimonious way with a profession of fear of the Lord on their lips; but their heart is far from him. They have denied the coming of the Lord and his kingdom to bless mankind, and have openly allied themselves with the Devil’s scheme of salvation by human effort and leagues. The Lord has not delayed but has been swift to witness against them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.—Matthew 24:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many have expressed surprise that the war stopped so suddenly. Jehovah wanted it stopped. In due time the Lord saw that his seiwants in various parts of the earth were released from prison that preparation might be made for the Elisha work, the witness to the nations of the earth. A knowledge of this fact should thrill the heart of every Christian. The fact that the great Jehovah God and the Lord Jesus, the King of kings should intervene and stop the warring nations and command peace, in order to give a little handful of Christians in the earth an opportunity to be his witnesses, is too marvelous to be expressed in words. It should humble every Christian and cause him to tighten up his armor for service unto the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">December 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">thank thee, 0 Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Matthew 11:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s secrets are with them that fear him. They are hid to those who are wise and prudent in a worldly sense. Jehovah has so arranged it that if any one would be wise in the things of the Lord he must become a fool in the eyes of the world, and he must become as a babe in receiving the milk of the Word. To such the Lord reveals the deep things, the mysteries of the kingdom, by his spirit. This should be a cause for thanksgiving. Yet it follows that greater knowledge brings that much greater responsibility. A knowledge of these mysteries requires everyone to whom they are revealed to use his faculties to the glory of the One who grants him this privilege. Blessed is the portion of the Christian now, when “none of the wicked . . . understand”, to know the mysteries of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">December 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Pray to thy Father in secret; and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Matthew 6:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If you desired a special favor at the hands of some earthly ruler, you would not wish to call a public assembly of the people, and loudly announce in their presence your requests addressed to the ruler. You would prefer to have a secret audience with him that you might present your matter in a better and more direct way. Since prayers are addressed to Jehovah, the effectual prayer is that petition which is secretly presented to Jehovah God in the name of Jesus Christ. Long prayers uttered in the presence of others, and praying openly with a sanctimonious attitude that can be seen of others, are generally intended to attract attention to the one praying and not to God. We may be sure that Jehovah does not hear and answer such prayers. Let us remember that Jehovah sees and hears us, even though we but come to him in prayerful attitude in secret.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">December 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A. Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred 'forty and four thousand, having his Father’s name written in their foreheads.—Revelation 14:1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The name of Jehovah written in their foreheads in effect says: These belong to Jehovah God and have the honor of bearing his name before others. They are seen on mount Zion, which is God’s organization. The class here described includes the last members of the church on earth, called to the position of honor to declare the name of Jehovah. These are therefore standing with Christ Jesus the King, which means that they willingly and joyfully support him and are described by the Psalmist thus: “Thy people [are] willing in the day of thy power.” (Psalm 110: 3) The Lord graciously gives them a vision of his purpose; and appreciating their favor from him, the faithful remnant joyfully enter into his service. If faithful they will continue to so serve him henceforth and for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">So didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.—Isaiah 63: 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God led his people forth out of Egypt to get for himself a name. He will shortly manifest his supreme power before all nations. The people of God now go forth to battle, knowing that he will be their strength. There are times when the way seems dark, and the enemy seemingly will overwhelm the anointed of God. It is a test of faith. God will not permit the enemy to triumph from henceforth. The fact that the time has come to get for himself a name in the earth is conclusive proof that the enemy must fail. The anointed witnesses of God do not go forth in a cocksure manner, declaring that they are going to win; but it is their privilege to declare with absolute certainty that Jehovah will win. The honor of his name is at stake. Great is their privilege now by being permitted to be on the side of the Lord, to bear witness to his name and be partakers of the victory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">December 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.—Psalm 126:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah anointed Jesus with the holy spirit to proclaim liberty to the captives. In harmony with this Jehovah sent him in 1874 as the great Cyrus or Sun to bring “deliverance to the captives” of mystic Babylon. They longed for freedom and were eager to avail themselves of the opportunity to leave Babylon and go up and build the house of the Lord God. There Jehovah turned the captivity of Zion. The Psalmist had previously composed a song of gladness which now they could sing: “Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them. The Lord hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.” That which first made glad the hearts of Christians, then, was the revealing of the great truth that Jehovah had provided restoration blessings for all the nations of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly; not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">before of God, even to us.—Acts 10:40,41,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah did not openly display the resurrected Jesus to the vulgar gaze of the people who three days before had cried for his crucifixion, nor to the priests and other chief religionists of the time. Thus he did not try to convince them of Jesus’ resurrection and thereby make them his witnesses. Jehovah authorized Jesus to manifest himself to the few faithful ones, whom he thereby made his witnesses in behalf of the rest of the people. This illustrates Jehovah’s order of dealing; namely, to favor the approved ones and make them competent and reliable witnesses to the peoples of his manifold works. His witnesses are never the mighty, the haughty or the proud. He does not choose evil men to represent him. His witnesses at this time are, like the apostles of old, the meek and teachable ones, who are moved by love in his service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">December 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Peter 1: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus, the Head of the new creation, was begotten by his heavenly Father’s spirit at Jordan river. Inasmuch as begetting means to give a start in life, here was the beginning of the new creation. For three and a half years he taught his disciples. Though fully consecrated, they could not, however, become new creatures before the great ransom sacrifice was presented to divine justice as a sin-offering. When Jesus was resurrected from the dead and ascended on high, this was presented; and evidence of the presentation and the divine acceptance was given at Pentecost, when the holy spirit was poured out upon the disciples. Then first were the disciples justified, and begotten unto a hope of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God . . . hath prepared for them a city.—Heb. 11:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the outworking of his plan God honored certain men, among whom was Abraham, by giving them the privilege of being his witnesses. These men were imperfect, but they had an honest desire to see better conditions for mankind. They were in the world over which Satan presided as god; and yet they had no sympathy with that world. Their desire was for a government ruled over by the righteous One of heaven. They took their stand unreservedly on the side of God, and all manner of persecution failed to move them from their course. Because of their faithfulness God was not ashamed to be called their God. He has provided that their citizenship shall be in the new earth which will be presided over by the new heaven, of which Christ is the Head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">December 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.—Romans 6: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It seems to be a clearly settled rule of Jehovah to compel no one to accept life; but he provides the way whereby eternal life may be gained, and then offers it as a gracious gift. There can be no gift without knowledge and without consent and acquiescence on the part of the recipient to the terms governing the gift. In harmony with this fact, the great God of love has so arranged it that in his own due time all men shall be brought to a knowledge of divine truth in order to furnish them an opportunity to accept life on the generous terms offered. Ye truth-favored ones, give thanks to the Giver of every good and perfect gift, for this boon of life. Bear the knowledge of the truth which you now possess to others that they too may rejoice in knowing of Jehovah’s loving provision for eternal life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the Lord will I destroy them.—Psalm 118:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The servants of the Lord see themselves compassed about by the enemy. But they are not afraid. In the name of Jehovah, that is to say in the strength of his promises and covenant, they will go into battle and behold Jehovah destroy the enemy. He permits them to share in the victory. This does not mean that the people of God will themselves do any destroying; but it does mean that God will gain the victory for his people and destroy all who oppose him and his works. All nations, meaning all the organized powers of Satan, endeavor to destroy the anointed ones. The enemy broken in pieces, then God will save the people and show them the way to life. He will thus vindicate his name. That the people might have an opportunity to know what he will do, God now commands his anointed to be his witnesses in the earth and to sing forth the honor of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">December 13</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God: for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness.—Isaiah 61:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The garments of salvation and the robe of righteousness are Jehovah’s; and he furnishes them to his loyal Son, the Bridegroom, that he may invest the prospective members of his bride therewith. The company of approved ones, manifested since the great Refiner began his purifying of the antitypical sons of Levi in 1918, now stand gloriously arrayed in these vestments of divine approval, favor, and protection. It is a time of great rejoicing on their part; and their joy is not in themselves but in Jehovah, who has so highly honored them. They are zealously striving to manifest their appreciation to their great Benefactor by being true to the insignia of office conferred upon them. The high praises of God are in their mouths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Malachi 4:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has sent Elijah. Consistent with this fact, restitution began in 1874. Restitution is not confined alone to the restoring of man to his original state of perfection. Jesus said: “Elias [Greek form for Elijah] truly shall first come, and restore all things.” (Matthew 17:11) Elijah pictured the work of the church on this side the vail done prior to 1918. About 1874 began the restoration of the great fundamental truths of God’s plan. This same thing was pictured by the restoring of the golden vessels to the house of the Lord in Ezra’s day. The church has been doing a restoration work under the supervision of the King, Christ Jesus; and now all the great fundamental truths long hidden from view have been restored. Eor mankind to accept Jehovah’s gift of life, they must first come to an accurate knowledge of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">December 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, I create new heavens, and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.—Isaiah 65:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God’s announced purpose is to plant the new heavens and lay the foundation of the earth; and this he does’ through his organization, Zion. It is his purpose to establish his kingdom, both visible and invisible to man, which kingdom shall rule the people of earth and establish righteousness among them; and this work he does through Zion, whom he calls his people. While this work is proceeding, he has appointed his faithful remnant still on earth to bear witness to the inauguration of the new order. He has placed his message in their mouths that their lips might speak forth his praise. That they might be dauntless in the delivery of the message he assures them that they are sheltered under his overshadowing hand of power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Open io me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the Lord.—Psalm 118:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font3"> gate is a means of passage or a way through and into the wall of a city. A city symbolizes a government. The new government of earth was born in. 1914; for there Jehovah placed the government upon the shoulder of the Prince of Peace. That new government or city is Scripturally termed Zion. Of it the Prophet Isaiah writes: “Thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.” Since 1918 those who desire to serve the Lord in pointing the people to the way that leads into the kingdom have called upon the Lord to clear the way for service. Jehovah has opened the gates, opening the avenues of service; and they have entered into them by publicly showing forth the praises of the Lord. Thus they offer the Lord an offering in righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">December 17</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I will  ransom them from the power of the grave; I will  redeem them from death: 0 death, I will be thy plagues; 0 grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Hosea 13:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By virtue of the ransom which Jehovah provided in his obedient Son, Jesus, the redemption from death has been accomplished. Soon the immortal ones, The Christ, Head and body, will begin the great work of bringing the dead back to life. Out of tombs the Lord shall bring the millions that are sleeping there, and thus work the destruction of the grave. Millions of these shall come unto him with songs of joy upon their lips. He will gain for them the victory over death by restoring them to life. When his reign is finished, death will have received its plague, its death blow. It will be swallowed up in victory. Let us tell this good news to the sorrowing ones of earth, that their hearts may be comforted now in this time of stress. It is our privilege so to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">December 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Genesis 9:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God manifestly intended that when man looks upon the rainbow he shall call to mind that life proceeds from Jehovah, that life is a sacred thing, and that it cannot be taken with impunity. This arrangement stands for an everlasting covenant because God calls it such and because it must stand for ever. God will never change his expressed rule concerning sanctity of life. God has not tried to regulate the affairs of earth’s rulers, but he holds them responsible in proportion to their knowledge or their opportunity to acquire knowledge of the terms of his law. God’s covenant with Noah included all the living creatures on earth. It was his official covenant because it announced his law. The breaking of it time and again by rulers and inhabitants has resulted in defiling the earth. Isaiah 24: 5, 6 therefore assigns the breaking of this everlasting covenant as one of the reasons for God’s wrath against the organizations of men upon earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">December 19</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Let them . . . that love thy name be joyful in thee. —Psalm 5:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This text is a prayer that Jehovah will stay the further progress of his enemies that his name may be vindicated, and that those who love the name of Jehovah might be joyful in him. This is the proper prayer for the anointed ones of today. The time is at hand when God will vindicate his name; and, knowing this, our prayers and service should always be in harmony with that thought. Sometimes it seems that the enemy might triumph, and the anointed ones are for the time being discouraged. Then they cry unto the Lord, praying that the enemy may be held back and his destruction follow, and that those who love the Lord’s name may be joyful in him. He has brought such into his secret place and placed them under the protection of his mighty hand. They call upon each other to express appreciation by joyfully proclaiming the honor, fame and glory of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">December 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Fear thou not; for 1 am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will  strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Isaiah</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What a consoling and strengthening word this is I What a repellent of fear and dismay it is I Jehovah is with us. Blessed thought! And why ? Because we have made him the God whom we worship; we are his servants, and he has chosen us and not cast us away. He has taken us from the ends of the earth, and called us from the extremities thereof. He has called us to be his witnesses. His righteousness prompts him to be faithful to his calling of us and to uphold us in our capacity as his witnesses. Were it not for his support and defense we could not continue to carry on in this world of hateful enemies. But the right hand of his righteousness bears us up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">December 21</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">O sing unto the Lord a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.—Psalm 98:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord Jesus Christ is the great Executive Officer of Jehovah to carry into action the divine plan. Therefore he is the Right Hand and Holy Arm of Jehovah, the Most High. Christ is the One whom Jehovah uses to get the victory for the church; and in the great war in heaven against the Dragon, it is this same Right Hand and Holy Arm of God that gains the victory. In the fight on earth between the beast, the Devil’s organization, and the Lamb, it is the mighty Executive Officer of God that is triumphant. The victory over the Devil and his organization will be complete; and when that victory is won there will stand with the great Executor of Jehovah the one hundred and forty and four thousand called, chosen, and faithful ones. The victory is God’s which he gets in his own due time through his “holy arm”. With faith in the coming victory, let us sing the Lord’s praises throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever he mindful of his covenant.—Psalm 111:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was the love of Jehovah and faithfulness to his covenant that caused him to provide “whatsoever things were written aforetime . . . for our learning”. He did not provide that all the meat or food should be served to his household of sons at one time. He provided it as it was needed. “Thou givest them their meat in due season,” writes his prophet. As the perfect day has drawn nigh, Jehovah has caused greater light to shine upon his Word, thereby increasing the provision for those that fear him. He has given meat to the household through the Head of the house of sons, Jesus; for all things are of the Father and all things by the Son. Let no one flatter himself into believing that the Lord has specially authorized him to provide food for the household of faith by interpreting the Scriptures; for the Scriptures are not of private interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">December 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.—1 John 3:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To be loved by Jehovah, the eternal God, what a blessed privilege! How shall we express our deep regard and high valuation of his unusual manner of love bestowed upon us in begetting us and calling us sons of the divine family? Love begets love. “If God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.” We ought to have an unselfish love of our brethren that shall prompt us to lay down our lives for them that they may be aided in proving faithful unto death and gain the crown of life. Yea, and “if God so loved us” and was the first to demonstrate love in this now mutual interchange of love between the new creation and himself, we ought to love God above all. How may we possibly do this? “This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments : and his commandments are not grievous.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">December 24</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1 have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and 1 will clothe thee with change of raiment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Zechariah 3: J/..</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The travel-stained garments that the faithful wore on their return from captivity in mystic Babylon will not do, now that the Lord has come to his temple. They are not suitable for the church’s condition during the presence of her Bridegroom. Satan maliciously pointed to these soiled garments worn by the faithful church, pictured by Joshua the priest (Zechariah 3:1), and by this means accused her. The Lord rebuked Satan, and through his own messenger said concerning the faithful: “Take away the filthy garments from him [Joshua, the church]. ... I will clothe thee with change of raiment.” This pictures the faithful ones as </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">company receiving the robe of righteousness when the Lord comes to his temple. The receiving of the robe of righteousness is marked by a time of rejoicing by all who are faithful priests under the great High Priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">December 25</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign: Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.—Isaiah 7:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Over seven hundred years beforehand Jehovah God promised to give a sign or token of coming deliverance. The sign was to be that a virgin handmaid of the Lord should conceive a son in purity by the power of God. His name Immanuel was to indicate that God was with him and also with the cause of mankind. In due time Jehovah gave the sign by the human birth of his Son Jesus, and the angels of heaven glorified God in song and explained the sign to the lowly shepherds. It was the grandest event of human history up to that time; but a far greater event now outshines that event of more than nineteen centuries ago. For now chaste Zion has conceived; and in 1914 she brought to the birth a man child, the new nation. It is a sign of deliverance at hand, and Jehovah’s anointed ones now jubilantly announce the glad tidings to all the world, in honor or his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.—Isaiah 26:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the time of earth’s distress when the great city of Babylon is beginning to crumble, Jehovah’s faithful people find the place of security in him. Their soul or being desires him. They have nothing for which to live but to do his will and to seek the honor of his name. They are reminded of all he has done for them in the past and all that he has caused to be written for their encouragement and guidance in these last days. Being glad, they call upon him for continued strength and further opportunity of service. Their heart’s desire is that in this great work Jehovah is now doing in the earth they might have a part in it and bring some honor to his name. Those who really are devoted to the Lord not only will seek to have a part in his service, but they will encourage their brethren to join in this happy service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">December 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.—1 Corinthians 15:57.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah believes in victory for himself, for his cause, and for his people. Victory means the overthrow of that which is opposed to him. It means the triumph of righteousness. It means the vindication of his name and honor. It will result in blessings to those who benefit by the victory. It means the climax of joy and the dividing of the spoil on the part of those who share in the battle and stand on the victor’s side. It was by the exercise of God’s power through Christ Jesus that the great accuser of the brethren was ejected from heaven; and it is through Christ Jesus that God’s remnant, by remaining unequivocally loyal to Jehovah’s organization, get the victory in this day over the beast and over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name. Through Christ also will Jehovah give us the victory over death by the first resurrection. Can we not then take our harps and sing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">December 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater,—1 John 5:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Who has been more true and faithful as a witness for truth and righteousness than Jehovah, the Most High God, himself? If we receive the witness of any men who are serving or who have served the Lord, yet the witness of God is always greater. His great visible works of creation stand as silent, yet eloquent, testimonials to his almighty power and manifold wisdom, helping us to understand or perceive even the invisible things he has created. He has given us a written witness in his inspired Word. He has sent down his only-begotten Son from heaven as his “faithful and true” witness unto men. Jehovah has never left the world without convincing testimony. How significant then the words of the apostle become: “As he is, so are we in this world,” namely, witnesses. (1 John 4:17) Let us therefore “have boldness in (this) the day of judgment”, and bear faithful witness as “imitators of God”.—Eph. 5:1, A. R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">December 29</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1 love thee, 0 Jehovah, my strength. Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 18: 1, 2, A. R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Deliverer means savior, one who comes to the rescue of others and who defends, preserves and draws them out of a condition of danger, distress or death, and places them in a condition of relief, safety and blessing. In all the universe no one is more deserving of the name Deliverer, Savior, than Jehovah is. He properly and rightfully takes the name to himself, saying, “I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour. ... I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour.” These words apply especially to spiritual Israel, the new creation; but they also indicate that there can be no eternal salvation for mankind either apart from Jehovah. The Lord has only one channel on earth for now making known the tidings of coming deliverance for mankind; that channel is his anointed saints, his Servant class. They love him and he is their Deliverer through Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thou crownest the year of thy goodness [margin] ; and thy paths drop fatness.—Psalm 65:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The year” evidently means the period of time in which the goodness of God will he manifested toward all; that is to say, all will come to a knowledge of the glory and goodness and loving kindness of our God. When that year, namely the Millennium, is done, that year will be crowned; and its crown will be God himself, who is the perfect expression of goodness. Then will the prophecy spoken by David have its complete fulfilment, and the way of the Lord will drop with fatness or showers of blessings and joy for all of his creatures. Now the temple class of the Lord see by faith the glorious prospect. They cannot keep the vision to themselves, but act upon their privilege of being witnesses for God. They engage in telling the people of the goodness that he hath in reservation for mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">December 31</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Who shall not fear thee., 0 Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy.—Revelation 15:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When the peoples of earth see that the long dark night is past, when they see that the forces of evil are completely broken and that mankind is liberated from bondage, when they learn of their own redemption and that the way for them to get life and happiness is open, and when they learn that all these things God has provided for mankind, then will multitudes exclaim: ‘Who shall not fear thee, 0 Lord, and glorify thy name!” Out from darkness Jehovah has called his people and put his spirit upon them now. In advance of the world he shows them what he will do. According to their faith and confidence and love for God they enter into his service. They show their appreciation for the loving kindness of God by availing themselves of every opportunity to sing forth the honor of his name that others might know that he is the Most High and that his King and kingdom are now here.</span></p>
