<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">IS MONEY YOUR GOD?</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">W</span><span class="font16">THOUT money these days you could do very little. Yet too much interest in money can keep you from doing very much. When recognized for what it is money can be your servant, your slave. It can provide necessities, meet your obligations and aid you toward sound goals. But when allowed to get the upper hand it can enslave you in a web of greed, hatred and jealousy. It can make you too busy to enjoy your family and too grumpy to be enjoyed by them, too occupied with your own troubles to see a better thing, even when that better thing is set before you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">There are many levels of money worshiping. 'Some people’s love of money is so strong that it leads them into graft, crime, violence and murder. But there are other persons who are totally honest, who would commit no crimes to gain money—none, that is, except against themselves and their families. They may physically damage their bodies, developing ulcers and heart attacks, or becoming so hardened in their search for money that they become greedy and mean. Then, too, there are many ordinary people, perhaps a majority of people today, who are so busy in their search for money and so encumbered with the things that they buy with it that they have no time for true worship or for the true God. They may be very good people. Frequently they are very charitable—toward everyone except themselves! They will look out for the needs and best interests of others, but will take a course that does not meet their own needs and best interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">To prove that this view is real, and that a tremendous number of people do make money their god, just go along with one of Jehovah’s witnesses on a typical Sunday morning as he calls upon the people In their homes, encouraging Bible education and showing the people how to live happier lives. This is a public service, for the good of humanity, but spend your time warmheartedly helping others and common responses are; “What does it get you?” “Who pays you?” “There has to be a catch to it somewhere!” And, most common of all, the simple objection: “I’m too busy,” Too busy to look to a better thing, too enmeshed in the economic struggle to examine God’s Word, too occupied with things that are considered “important” to gain life!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">This is nothing new. Nearly two thousand years ago a rich young ruler, bound down with worldly cares, asked Jesus: “What good must I do in order to get everlasting life?” He was told: &quot;Observe the commandments continually.” This he said he did. He did not murder, steal, bear false witness, and he honored his father and mother and loved his neighbor as himself. But he asked: “What yet am I lacking?” and Jesus told him: “Sell your belongings</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven, and come be my follower.” The Scriptural account tells us: &quot;When the young man heard this saying, he went away grieved, for he was holding many possessions?’ (Matthew 19:16-24, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.)</span><span class="font1"> How similar this man's attitude was to today’s view of putting financial wealth ahead of spiritual welfare!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Why do money and wealth get this attention? Because they raise a man’s position in the eyes of the world, and because they are worshiped as the things that bring security. But money will not buy sound friends, it cannot buy God’s favor and it is not the thing that leads to the greatest happiness. Even further, it is a god whose rewards are short-lived, fleeting and untrustworthy, It is not a sound security.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Obviously it is a necessity and sr defense. But its value can be undermined. The Bible remains true when it calls the wealth of this system &quot;uncertain riches,” and when it advises: “Riches certainly make themselves wings, like an eagle that flieth toward heaven.”—1 Timothy 6:17, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.;</span><span class="font1"> Proverbs 23:5, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Am, Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Your search for money is a search for security. But the facts are that money does not bring real security. It may not buy as much next year as it does now. And when man has to fight with the thing he worships as security, then it is time to look to something firmer in which to trust. There is such a better thing. Many happier people have trusted in it What is it? and how will it benefit you? The following article answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Down through. the ages mon have sought security. Yet all too often they have considered Its real source too simple to be worthy of consideration. Are you interested in yottr own security? and willing to spend a few minutes* time to learn where it really car be found? Then this article is for you.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">SECURITY</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">M</span><span class="font1">ONEY is almost a necessity today. We need it to buy food, clothing, shelter and other requirements of Mfe. But many persons go much farther than that, not just using money as their servant but unwisely becoming its slave. Yet money'does not prove to be a firm security. Everyone knows that the purchasing power of a dollar, a franc, a peso or a shilling changes. Fluctuations in mone/s value have often destroyed in days the wealth men spent their lives accumulating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Money did not prove a firm security in Germany in 1923 where if you had saved even a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">trillion marTcs</span><span class="font1"> (1,000,000,000,000) you would have seen that tremendous sum</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">dwindle to the value of just one solitary mark! -It did not prove a firm security in Hungary in 1946. And even if you live in the United States and are now falling back on savings that you put aside as a young man in 1900, the money that you put aside for a chicken will now buy only the drumstick. The money that you put aside for a shirt will buy only the collar. The money for shoes will now pay for only the heels and laces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Even further, money can be lost through war, theft, poor management, or in any of numerous other ways. Thus, while money is a daily need, it becomes increasingly evident that for a real security we must have something firmer in which to trust— something that could not be lost, stolen or destroyed. There is such a firm security, and many men have set the example of trusting in it. Are you sufficiently interested in a real security to want to examine the examples they have set for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">They Found True Security</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">We can refer to ancient examples of men who looked to that which is of greatest value, and can find those examples in the Bible. Think back, for instance, to Moses’ situation. He lived amidst the majesty'and splendor of ancient Egypt. -The mighty Pharaohs were its rulers, and Moses was raised in Pharaoh’s palace, raised as though he were the son of Pharaoh’s daughter. He had prestige and honor and the security of Egypt’s military might— the very things that men unsuccessfully attempt to obtain with money today. Yet what course did Moses take? &quot;By faith Moses, when grown up, refused to be called the son of the daughter of Pharaoh, choosing to be ill-treated with the people of God rather than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin, because he esteemed the reproach of the Christ as riches greater than the treasures of Egypt.” Quite clearly Jehovah, and not money, was Moses’ God, and Moses received real security, security that came from God, plus great blessings and divine protection for putting his trust in the right place.—Hebrews 11:24-26, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Consider also the outstanding example set by ancient Job. A man of great wealth, he was called &quot;the greatest of all the men of the East.” Though Satan reduced him to a childless poverty-stricken state, Job proved that he considered his service to his heavenly Father to be of far greater importance than material wealth. He said: “If I have made gold my hope, and have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence; if I haye rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because my hand had gotten much; this also were an iniquity to be punished by the judges; for I should have denied the God that is above.” Job knew where to put his confidence, and his loss of material wealth had no effect upon his allegiance to his Creator. He was greatly blessed for this, in both spiritual and material ways.—Job 31:24, 25, 28, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Of</span><span class="font16"> course, there is the outstanding example of Jesus Christ himself. This Son of God could heal the sick—what a moneymaker he could have been had he taken collections as modem faith healers do! He could read men’s minds—what wealth and power and untold commercial accomplishments could have been his if he had wanted them! He was even sought by the people as a king—what political power he could have wielded! But he did not even own a house! He said: “The Son of man has nowhere to lay down his head.” When they wanted to make him king, Jesus “withdrew again into the mountain al! alone.” The greatest man who ever lived wanted only to serve his heavenly Father! Could you gain more than he could have? In trying to do so, are you happier or more secure than he was? Or are you rejecting the true source of happiness and of real security through an overemphasis on commercial gain? Could you spend a little more time in studying God’s Word, and a little more effort in his service, without thinking, as some people do: “What does it get me?” “What do I get out of it?’’ And could ■ you, as Jesus was, be happier for doing so?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">—Matthew 8:20; John 6:15, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Consider, too, Jesus’ apostles and their attitude toward real wealth. Could you imagine them asking, “What’s it going to get me?” when they had the opportunity of proclaiming that Jesus was the long-awaited Messiah? It got them peace of mind and assurance that they were doing right, plus the security of Jehovah’s rich blessings, and those are things that no amount of money could ever buy! Paul’s example is outstanding. Though educated at the feet of noted Gamaliel, he gave up any opportunity of worldly position to become a willing slave of God’s. He says he was “in labor and toil, in sleepless nights often, in hunger and thirst, in abstinence from food many times, in cold and nakedness.” Yet he was not disappointed. Rather, he said </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">he was “as poor but making many rich</span><span class="font16">, a^</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kaving nothing and yet possessing ^JltKin^^</span><span class="font16">Such spiritualriches are 'firm andsure. Thus, Paul did not put aside his missionary tours to gain financial security. Rather, he put his service to God first and securely said: “For all things I have the strength by virtue of him who imparts power to me.”—2 Corinthians 11:27; 6:10; Philippians 4:11-13, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Having set such a good example, the apostle Paul also gave sound advice on whether to put our desire for wealth or our service to God first. He wrote: “Let your manna? of life be</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">. free</span><span class="font16"> of the love of money, </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">while you are contenCwith the </span><span class="font16">present things.” Further: “For we have brought nothing into the world, and neither can we carry anything out. So, having sustenance and covering, we shall be content with these things. However .J</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">^hose wh</span><span class="font16">o </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">are determined to be rich fall into</span><span class="font16">JemnUp </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">tion and &quot;a snare and many sensele</span><span class="font16">ss and hurtful desires which plunge men'intoU^ structionafitr ruin. For the love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things, and by reaching out for this love some have been led astray from the faith and have stabbed themselves all over with many pains.&quot; There is nothing wrong with money in itself, butjfi</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">s. the love of it, the </span><span class="font16">greed for more^the fceling~TEaKTriTlhe oVre^Blng'that brings security, and therefore the making of it into a god, that leads the individual away from real security and out of true worship.—Hebrews 13:5; 1 Timothy 6:7-10, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Do you think that these good examples were set by some special kind of men, and that they could put God’s service first and be happier for it, but that it does not work today and is not practical for you? Well, do not be mistaken; it does work today! True, Christians of the first century were different from the rest of this world. But </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">this was not because they were lunatics or freakishly oiFbalance. R</span><span class="font16">ather, itwasbe^ cause they^Avere^devoted to truth and right</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">eousness.,</span><span class="font16"> andj^tfiy^s</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">^</span><span class="font16">^ff^joSZ^ ^SsFfljlH^^aTTTiey'wreTntclligent men and^womenTTar* smarter than their opponents who were too dull of hearing to recognize the way that really does lead to happiness, security and life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The reason these early Christians had zeal, enthusiasm, determination, power and endurance in far greater measure than did the devotees of other religions is </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">.becau</span><span class="font16">se </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">their God is worthwhile</span><span class="font16">! They considered itareall)opoi</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">\and_£</span><span class="font16">he^gi^atgst</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">^~IPys to fellow c</span><span class="font16">reatures </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">abouk</span><span class="font16">the</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">^nar-</span><span class="font16">velous proyJ</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">^onfe</span><span class="font16">rliaTmade for their salvation and deliverance. This brought them more Joy than any other course they could take, and nothing was going to hinder them from this service. And, though most modem church members are apathetic, </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">True Christianity Jias the sany joy, zeal </span><span class="font16">and securi</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">ty even today !</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">It is foolish to say that this course will not work, until you have examined it for yourself. And it is even more foolish to say that Jehovah's blessings are not of greater value than an excess of money, before you even know what those blessings are.

<div>
<p><span class="font15">IBtCTai</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">No amount of money will buy it, but God’s favor will provide the one thing that is of greatest value, namely, everlasting life itself. Genesis chapters one and two, the only reliable account of creation anywhere ir. existence, says nothing about men’s dying, except as a punishment for disobedience. And after human death came into existence as a result of disobedience, Christ’s ransom sacrifice made it possible </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">that the</span><span class="font16"> present </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">unnatural dying £ </span><span class="font16">man would ritjF last forcvgn.The Bible-pointedly shows that theunflatural state of death is to be abolished and that peace and permanent life will remain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">How can you receive such a blessing as that? Jesus answered: “For this is the will of my Father, that everyone that beholds the Son and exercises faith in him should have everlasting life, and I should resurrect him at the last day.” To receive this blessing of everlasting life, true knowledge is required: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.”—John 6:40; 17:3, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Is there any amount of money that you would not spend to gain such an everlast-ir.g security? Well, you do not have to spend money to receive it, hut </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">you do have to spend time and energy in study and in </span><span class="font16">God’s service. It is certainly worth that time because those who have such a rare and costly treasure are richer than if they had gained the whole world! Should anything, either your love of money, or your search for prestige and position, or any other time-consuming act, stand in your way of receiving that sure promise of everlasting life—a promise backed up by the Creator of the universe? No amount of wealth or position or honor could equal it! So, do not long for the evilly gotten gain of the old system, but look with confl dence to the righteousness of everlasting life in the new.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Of course, it is true that you must support your family, must care for your needs, and if you have obligations you may need to set aside a small sum for a future emergency. But &lt;to not become ensnared by the creeping tentacles of financial greed, </span><span class="font15">It is </span><span class="font16">always a temptation to want a little mere . . . then a little more . . . then a </span><span class="font15">little </span><span class="font16">more than that, until your time and offers are so occupied that you have no time either to study God’s Word cr to prove zealous in his service. Most of the world is in this position today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But remember, it is only from God that true riches will be obtained. Only by lovingly serving him will you receive the real security—protection through the destruction he will socn bring upon this corrupt old world’s systems. No amount of money will help you through that destruction, but the sure wealth of God’s protection will. It is a security that can never be deflated, stolen or undermined by anyone except yourself. It is the best thing you could ever obtain..</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">So, there is every reason to take the sound, Biblical course and to </span><span class="font15" style="font-variant:small-caps;">make Jehovah, not money, your God!</span></p><img src="g_E_19551008_files/g_E_19551008-6.png" alt="" style="width:200pt;height:157pt;">
<p><span class="font16"><sup>r</sup>&quot;pHE sun has always represented an in-</span><span class="font20">1 </span><span class="font16">exhaustible storehouse of energy to man. To harness it for civilization's needs has been one of his aspiring goals. If only one second of the sun’s work could be trapped, say solar experts, tnankind’s power requirements for the next two million years could be supplied!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Every hour the sun floods the earth with a deluge of thermal energy equal to 21 billion tons of coal. Every day it pours out more than a quadrillion (1,000,000,000,000,000) kilowatt hours of energy, greater than the energy content of all the reserves of coal, oil, natural gas and uranium in the crust of the earth; and greater than all mankind’s muscle, fuel and working waterfalls have generated since the beginning o: time. Multiply 684 million tons, the approximate figure of both anthracite and bituminous coal mined annually in the United States, by the number 500 million million. Even that figure would not equal the yearly</span></p><img src="g_E_19551008_files/g_E_19551008-7.png" alt="" style="width:184pt;height:94pt;">
<p><span class="font16">solar energy. Fortunately for us, not alt of this energy strikes the earth or else we would have perished long ago. We do receive about 1/200-millionth of it, or 4,690,000 horsepower for each square mile. The rest goes to other planets or is lost in space. At current power rates our sun bill would be at least a billion dollars a minute. What a wonderful God we have to give us all this power free!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Suppose the sun would cease to shine. How long would earth’s fuel supply last, that is, if it were to give us energy at the rate we enjoy receiving it from the sun? All the earth’s combustible fuel—wood, oil, natural gas, coal, uranium, thorium, etc., would be gone in about three days. After that, the earth would begin its descent toward some temperature only slightly above absolute zero—460 degrees Fahrenheit below the usual zero. The land would become snowbound in no time; the oceans, rivers and lakes would freeze and all vegetation and animal life would cease from the earth. The earth would become a dark, lifeless bail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But there is r.o need to fear for such ever to happen. Scientists are confident that the sun will go on shining for billions of years to come. And our God Jehovah gives us his word that, like bis throne, the sun is established forever. (Psalm 89:36) However, there is cause for concern over the present rate of consumption of combustible material and the known sitf&amp;lies on hand on earth. Eric Hodgins in raSyarti-cle “Power of the Sun” says: &quot;In the hundred years that &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!l</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">ended in 1950, Industrial Man can-sumed two thirds as much energy as was used throughout the entire Christian era of the preceding eighteen and one-half centuries. That is a world figure.&quot; He goes on to say that the United States now consumes fifty times as much energy a year as it did when Thomas Jefferson was president; that, for room or “space heating” alone, this nation consumes “over three times as much fuel as the operation of all the country’s railroads; over twice as </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">much as the running of</span><span class="font16"> all its automobiles, trucks, and airplanes; and fifteen per cent more than the total of its manufacturing and mining operations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In many other parts of the world, like India, the fuel shortage is real and no joke. </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Science News Letter for</span><span class="font16"> November 13, 1954, reports that lack of fuel has forced low-income families to use the only </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">fuel </span><span class="font16">available—the vegetation around them. This has resulted in deforestation and soil erosion. Where vegetation is scarce, dried animal dung is used as the only remaining cheap, available fuel. This authority contends that “in India, 78% of the yearly fuel requirements are filled by dried cow dung.” This practice of using cow dung for fuel, besides having health and esthetic drawbacks, has played havoc with agriculture. Animal fertilizer is heeded for the soil to revitalize it and increase its crop yield. The above report says: “Experts estimate that the use of animal fertilizer for cooking now cuts the productivity of the land by nearly half,” and this in areas that already suffer from food shortages and periodic famines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">An analysis made for the Atomic Energy Commission by palmer Putnam, whose figures were also accepted by fifty scientists as accurately setting forth the problem at hand, stated that the world’s usable supplies of coal, gas and oil will be exhausted by the year 2023. And in an additional 175 years usable supplies of uranium and thorium, the sources of atomic energy, would also be gone. These authorities predict that within 245 yeans man must be prepared to capture one per cent of all incoming rays from the sun and utilize them for heat and for power to drive the world's machinery, or else face a major catastrophe. “There is little enough time left,” say they, “for solving the problems of capturing solar energy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Harnessing the Sun for Power</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Despite the fact that scientists have been experimenting with solar energy for the last two hundred years, the matter is still considered to be in the teasing, research state of infancy. As far back as 1818 Mou-chot designed an engine that produced </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">about one horsepower from a twenty-</span><span class="font16">square-yard reflector at the Paris exhibition. Adams in India built solar stoves around 1870, but neither his nor Mouchot’s contraptions were popular. In 1925, the Smithsonian Museum' exhibited a solar cooker designed by Dr. C. G. Abbot. Since then similar devices have been made,</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A solar engine, which for a time pumped water on a South Pasadena, California, ostrich farm, was powered by 1,800 mirrors concentrating sun rays on a tubular boiler, which heated 100 gallons of water to the boiling point. The steam from the boiling water was used to work a pump, and the pump raised 1,000 gallons of water a minute. In Egypt irrigation power was obtained by rotating mirrors, which focused rays on a horizontal boiler. And, according to Russian claims, giant reflectors operate textile factories; high-pressure solar heaters cook fruit and vegetables in canneries, distill water, -make ice and </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">heat laboratories.</span><span class="font16"> They claim that they have generated steam at 875 degrees Fahrenheit with rolled glass mirrors set in concrete. Professor A. V. Baum, head of the Soviel Union’s Heliotechnical Laboratory at the G. M. Krsyhishanovsky Power Institute at Tashkent, stated that Soviet engineers have succeeded in capturing solar energy with concave mirrors about thirty-three feet in diameter and thus generating some 130 pounds of steam an hour at a pressure of 100 pounds to the square inch, American scientists admit this is amazing—if true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In the village of Mont Louis in the French Pyrenees, Felix Trombe, a solar engine designer, has harnessed the sun’s energy in the form of pure, directed heat which &quot;can melt or vaporize substances without contaminating them with chemical alloys or impurities.” Trombe’s power plant is a giant, flat, 43-by-34-foot mirror that automatically follows the sun, deflecting the sun’s rays to a fixed parabolic mirror some 80 feet away. This 31-foot-high mirror made of 3,500 pieces of cheap window glass, acts as a gigantic burning glass, concentrating the heat into a single focal point, which has reached temperatures as high as 3,000 degrees centigrade or 5,432 degrees Fahrenheit!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">This sun furnace can melt 130 pounds of iron an hour and has actually burned holes in aluminum oxide—the fire resistant material used to line electric furnaces! Only sun power can produce such intense heat. And only sun power can make a fire brick, which is made to withstand heat, radiate like a miniature sun. Under the 120-inch aluminum solar furnace owned by the United States navy, fire brick not only will glow like the sun but can be turned into a steamy vapor in less than ten seconds. Before you can count ten, the furnace temperature rises to three thousand degrees centigrade, and in a few seconds more it doubles that amount, and it is possible to cool the furnace off almost as quickly with the use of special shades.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Future Prospects</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Experimental solar mocfels indicate that twenty to twenty-five per cent of the sun’s energy intercepted by man can be transformed into mechanical power. At this rate, the experts say, 750 square miles of desert territory in the United States could easily furnish all the electric power now required for heat, light, transportation and industrial purposes. A power plant covering one-fifth the state of New Mexico could supply 10 trillion horsepower hours a year —30 times the present annual electrical energy production in the United States. Such a power plant could now be built, only the project would be expensive, about 200 billion dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Recently, the Bell Telephone Laboratories demonstrated a solar battery that can convert sunlight into usable electric current without costly intermediate steps. The battery produces enough electricity to power small radio transmitters and record players. Since nothing is consumed or destroyed in the energy-conversion process and there are no moving parts, the solar battery should theoretically last indefinitely. The Bell solar experts foresee in their new discovery a beginning of a solar era.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Scientists are positive that a solar age will arrive, but there appears to be some discrepancy as to when. Professor Farrington Daniels of the University of Wisconsin said that in the next twenty-five years solar energy would be used mainly for small appliances such as cookers and heating apparatus or air conditioning for homes. Solar power plants of 100,000 kilowatts or more, he said, are probably beyond the horizons of 1980. Dr. James Bryant Conant, former president of Harvard University, also a top scientist, predicted that by 1985 cheap solar stills would turn deserts into garden spots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Future prospects of the sun’s coming to man’s rescue in his fuel crisis are bright.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">By &quot;Awoke!<sup>1</sup>* t&amp;f-rwpandent In Austria</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-variant:small-caps;">mOMETIMES you see them driving from K one place to another with their horse-ggg drawn carts. From their features you can tell that they are not natives of Europe, They have dark wavy hair, large black or brown eyes, dark skin and are of small stature. They are not understood by most people, and wherever they go they are not welcome. Who are they? The gypsies’</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Where did the gypsies come from? Their origin is obscure. Their language is one of the clearest indications of their origin that exists. It belongs to the Indo-European language family and is called Romany; all of its dialects are clearly connected with Sanskrit, the oldest-known written language cf the group. So it is now generally believed that the gypsies came from southeastern or central India, reaching Persia about the beginning cf the tenth century A.D. The first gypsies appeared in Europe at the beginning ^of the fourteenth century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">&lt; Persecuted wherever they wandered, they have been accused of crimes from petty thievery to witchcraft. They have been subjected to much suffering, even in modern times. During the Nazi regime many male gypsies were sterilized and both sexes were put to forced labor. In 1938 there were about 15,000 gypsies in Austria; after they came out of Hitlers concentration camps, just </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">4000 were</span><span class="font20"> left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">i The gypsies are an intelligent people, whose IQ often is much higher than that cl the people among whom they live, 'They have had to yield to the surrounding people, if they wanted to get along relatively well- -n spite Of this their pride and a certain feeling cf superiority are unbroken. These outcasts from human society have built up a tight relationship among themselves. They claim to obey and follow only their clan chief, who has the right to demand unconditional obedience. All quarrels are brought before him and severer cases before a regular gypsy court. So gypsies, in their own affairs, appear very seldom !*■ fore the courts of the countries in which they live. In their own courts everything is done orally, and the most severe sentence is to be expelled from the tribe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Tn gypsy family life the women play not an insignificant part in the support of the group, principally by means of their fortune-telling, in which they employ various forms of prediction, ranging from tea leaves to the tarot pack of cards. The parents have a real love for their children. Yet they do not pamper them. The belief that gypsies steal other children and take them along as their own, it appears, is largely </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">a myth.</span><span class="font20"> It is not in keeping with their custom of extreme pride that the gypsies have in the purity of their race<sup>1</sup>. </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">A </span><span class="font20">gypsy couple have, on the average, between six to eight children; not Infrequently a family has up to eighteen members</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Children marry early and within the tribe. The laws are very strict and marital unfaithfulness is rare. The penalty for it is a. visible cut with a knife from the mouth to the cheek; at the same time the guilty one is cast out cf the tribe. But these cuts are not found very often.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The many taboos stem from the gypsies rfuigicn, which In Austria is Roman Catholic<sup>1</sup>. But the gypsies have more suj^erstilions than many Roman Catholics have. This is because the gypsies absorb the religion of the people among whom they move, mixing with it (he accumulated mythologies and superstitions that they have picked up In their many wanderings. This results in a hodgepodge cf false religions, Gypsies even practice a kind of heathen ancestor worship, and they believe so thoroughly ir the spirits of the dead that they, for fear of being attacked, do not like to leave their camp at night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20"><sup>1</sup> It is heart-cheering to know that today in Austria, as well as in Germany, there are some gypsies who have abandoned false religion. These ones have renounced dishonesty, divination and superstition, and have taken up true religion. They now live according to the righteous principles of God's Word, being associated with the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses. The hope of these gypsies is to be among that &quot;great crowd” of persons “out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues” who will gain everlasting life or. earth, after Armageddon, in God’s new world. —Revelation 7:9, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">What damages the scorpion’s reputation for ferocity the most is the fact that he harbors no hatred for man; he looks for bugs, not us. And the scorpion just cannot live up to his reputation of bringing death to every man he stings. This is because his poison, though instantly fatal to bugs, very rarely produces death in man. So, as the American Museum of Natural History recently pointed out, the scorpion just does not live up to tales told about him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">There is a widespread belief that when a scorpion is surrounded by fire he will commit suicide by stinging himself to death. This is ridiculous for the reason that the scorpicn is immune to his own poison and the poison of his own species. quickly, but not because he commits suicide. Another story about scorpions is that they always travel in pairs. This is not entirely true. It may happen occasionally; but when two are found together they usually are courting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Ln a contest for sinister-looking animals the scorpion ought to take top honors; at least there are thousands of women who would cast their votes his way. Though he looks much like a small lobster, the scorpion has the added hideous feature of a dagger attached to his flexible tail. No doubt about it, that tail, as it waves in all directions, is really wicked-looking! The tail is usually carried upward and forward over the back; at its tip is a curved, hollow, poison-oozing sting. This is the scorpion’s heavy-caliber weapon. It is highly effective ir. protecting the scorpion’s life. Evidently the scorpion believes in preparedness, since his front end is also well protected. Here are two formidable pincers. These certainly ought to frighten enemies away.’But their primary function is to grab, hold and mash prey. A pair of nippered jaws completes the scorpion’s sinister-looking'equipment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">How Dangerous to Man?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">If scorpions were as ferocious and deadly as many people believe, there would not oe many of the human family left, for scorpions live in almost all parts of the world south of the fortieth parallel of north latitude, a notable exception being New Zealand. Preferring the warm climates, scorpions live under a wide variety , of conditions. Some thrive in tropical forests; others do well on open plains and sandy deserts. There are a few at high altitudes with abundant snow in winter. About 400 species exist. These range from one to eight inches in length. Of course, things grow big in the tropics and some, such as the big black scorpion, may reach a length of nine or ten inches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Generally, the scorpion does his best to avoid members of the human family. But his best is not always good enough. In his nighttime travels he sometimes blunders into human habitations. When day begins to break, Mr. Scorpion clambers into anything cozy and dark. So we sometimes meet this. sinister-looking animal. To prevent these chance meetings from being painful, the prudent man in tropical areas develops the habit of thoroughly shaking his shoes and clothing before putting them on. But what happens if a man fails to see the scorpion in time and he gets stung?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">What happens depends upon the type of scorpion and the type of person stung. A scorpion sting can be most dangerous to an enfeebled, hypemervous adult or to a young child. On healthy adults, the sting of most scorpions has no serious effect other than to cause a very painful wound. But some very dangerous scorpions live in Trinidad, North Africa, Malaya, India and other tropical regions. An Egyptian scorpion is reported to have a death rate of over 50 per cent among young children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The most formidable scorpion in the Western Hemisphere is the Durango scorpion found in the state of Durango, Mexico, and adjacent areas. A healthy, grown person has been known to die within less than an hour from the sting of one of these. Over a period of some 35 years about 1,600 deaths in Durango have been ascribed to these creatures. A good antivenom has now greatly reduced the deaths. In the United States scorpions do no worse than bees or wasps. But for children there is an exception. In southern Arizona there are scorpions, relatives of the Durango species, that reportedly have caused the death of two dozen children. But whether children or adults, all should give due respect to any scorpion. Remember, even the least dangerous stinging creatures, such as honey bees or hornets, may occasionally cause severe trouble in an especially sensitive individual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Scorpions<sup>1</sup> Bill of Fare</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">When it comes to making a living, the scorpion, as you can well imagine, does all right for himself. Strangely enough, he is almost deaf and can see only a few inches; so he depends largely on touch. The scorpion’s large, powerful pincers are studded with hairs. These hairs are hypersensitive. The plodding beetle or the scurrying cockroach that blunders into these hairs has sounded its own death knell. With hair-trigger action the scorpion's pincers seize the bug in a vicelike grip. If the prey is small, the claws do the whole business of slaughter. A larger victim, however, is firmly grasped and held, while the tail is curved over the back and the sting is brought down to deliver the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">coup de grdce. </span><span class="font16">After this there is no resistance, and Mr. Scorpion leisurely eats his meal. He may remain at the dinner table for an hour or more while dining on a single beetle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It should be remarked that the scorpion’s meals are often made up of agile, elusive creatures (what is more elusive than a cockroach?). So in spite of his poor eyesight he does extremely well. But not too much credit should be paid the scorpion in this regard, because his potential dinners are not all keener of sight than their captor. If the tidbit-minded scorpion fails to stir up a juicy bug during the night’s prowling, he can bear it. If he has to, the scorpion can live without a meal for as long as thirty days!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Cannibal Bride and Baby-toting Mother</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">One item of diet has not been mentioned. It is the scorpion! The courting season often ends in tragedy. Before wedding bells the males woo most ardently. The male grasps a buxom female, greatly his superior in size and power; and, with their hideous faces brought into contact, they exchange what a scorpion poet might dignify with the name of a kiss. Then off they prance. This dance of the scorpions is truly remarkable (it was shown in the nature movie “The Living Desert’’). As in the tango, the male leads. He grasps the female’s claws and leads her after him. They may prance about for hours till finally he induces the future Mrs. Scorpion to approach a burrow that he digs for the wedding. Once the nuptials are over the bride settles down to the chores of housekeeping, and she sometimes dines on her bridegroom. Oh, he is not stung to death—merely eaten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In due time the children arrive. Mrs. Scorpion does not deposit eggs like her cousins, the spiders; she gives birth to living young. Immediately after birth the baby scorpions scamper upon mamma’s back and cling to all parts of her body by their pincers. Perched on her back like so many passengers on a crowded bus, they are ready for a ride. Fortunately no conductor is present or there would be wholesale ejections: “No room on top” would be sounded. Once aboard and seated the babies are quiet and good. But the driving is careless and sometimes makes insufficient allowance for obstructions so that the passengers are swept from their seats. On these occasions the bus usually stops and waits and the passengers run up and climb back to their places. Babies or no babies, mother still likes to snatch a morsel now and then; so she runs down what game her burdened state allows. While mother, with knife and fork, the pincers and nippers, tears into a bug dinner, the young sit above, viewing the orgy with complete indifference. They are no more interested than human passengers are interested when their bus stops to refuel. After about a week the scorpion transit system loses its passengers as the youngsters, one by one, drop off and begin shifting for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">So the scorpion, though not exactly a lovable creature, is curiously interesting. His villainies have been exaggerated. He is on the search for bugs, not you. If he meets you he shows a much more anxious desire to avoid notice than to attack. With proper provocation, of course, any scorpion is not adverse to testing his stinging weapon on human anatomy. So if you meet up with nature’s Mr. Sinister, and he starts to wave the business end of his tail, remember, he is simply saying: “You have been warned!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Sewage Gas Packs Power!</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">■g Sewage gas, the result of the bacterial decomposition of sewage sludge, packs more power than most people think. It is now being used in the United States to heat buildings, generate electricity and operate engines for pumping sewage. At a meeting of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, R. A. Hoot, sanitary engineer for Philadelphia, estimated: “'If all the energy contained in America's sewage could be captured, it would provide sufficient power to run a half-million horsepower engine continuously.”</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Smoking and Lung Cancer</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">,■ At the American Medical Association’s convention at Atlantic City, New Jersey, early in June, 1955, more proof was adduced showing the direct relationship between lung cancer and smoking. One report shows that in 32 months lung cancer had killed only 33 per 100,000 of observed nonsmokers, but 246 per 100,000 regular cigarette smokers, or seven times as many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">As regards typical carcinoma of the lungs, the following statistics were reported: nonsmokers, 5 per 100,000; less than a pack of cigarettes a day, 128 per 100,000; one to two packs a day, 227 per 100,000; and more than two packs a day, 460 per 100,000, or 90 times the rate of non smokers!</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Those reluctant to see the connection between lung cancer and smoking like to point to the fact that there is a higher incidence of lung cancer in the cities than in country areas. The report indicated that this was so because city dwellers smoked more heavily than did country smokers—Time, June 13, 1955.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Blood Transfusions and Hepatitis</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">, Dr. Walter C. Alvarez, emeritus consultant iri medicine, Mayo clinic, and emeritus professor of medicine, Mayo foundation, in discussing hepatitis had the following to say about it and blood transfusions:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">/ &quot;What is sad is that the virus is very hard to kill or to get rid of. It can be transmitted from person to person, even on a hypodermic needle which has been thrown in alcohol or boiled only a minute. To be safe, the needle must be boiled for many minutes. Many of the kind of persons who give their blood to a blood bank are, all unknown to themselves, carrying the virus. It remains in the body a long time. Obviously, then, it is dangerous for much needed it.”—Minneapolis, Minnesota,</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Star,</span><span class="font15"> May 11, 1955.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">. Agreeing with Dr. Alvarez is the Virginia </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Medical Monthly,</span><span class="font15"> which in its issue of May, 1955, told of the warning by three physicians that “blood transfusions should be given only when the risk of failure to use it is greater than the risk of the many complications which may arise from its use.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">In view of the foregoing, of pertinent interest is what the Atlanta, Georgia, </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Journal and Constitution,</span><span class="font15"> February 27, 1955, reported under the heading: “Hepatitis Spread Puzzles Officials.” “In Georgia, as in the nation as a whole, the rapid spread of an old disease, infectious hepatitis—or yellow jaundice—is puzzling health ofiicials. Nationally, during the past three years, the number of cases reported has doubled annually.&quot; And according to a United Press dispatch, it is now the fifth-most prevalent communicable disease. Could it be that there is a connection between the increase of infectious hepatitis and the ever-increasing use of blood and plasma transfusions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Do the hospitals and doctors have any responsibility in this matter? While there seems to be a division of opinion on it among legal circles, as far as the United States is concerned, the French Supreme Court upheld a decision handed down by the Paris court of appeals condemning the French National . Blood Transfusion Center to pay 400,000 francs (about $1,100) to a woman who had contracted syphilis as a result of receiving contaminated blood in a blood transfusion. </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">—Le Monde,</span><span class="font15"> December 24, 1954.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">. And that there is also another risk in blood transfusions is apparent from the following headlines that appeared in the public press in the past few months: “Mismatched Blood Blamed for Death,” </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Breeze,</span><span class="font15"> Hermosa Beach, California; &quot;Wounded Boy Dies of Transfusion,&quot; the Knoxville, Tennessee, </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Journal;</span><span class="font15"> &quot;Death Blamed on Transfusion of Wrong Blood,” Toronto, Ontario, Canada, </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Star,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">AKING, selling and smelling perfume is a fabulous business. Over one hundred million dollars* worth is sold yearly in the United States alone! There are more than five thousand American and a thousand French brands to choose from. And their prices range anywhere from 50 cents to $400 an ounce. The bewitching potions come in bottles of all shapes, sizes and colors, and some of the names are simply fantastic: My Claw, Scandal, Mad Love, Snob, Savage, Frantic and Fanatic—to name just a few. Some firms have as many as 25,000 formulas stored away in their vaults. It takes just one good one to thrive in the business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Even though perfumers direct their advertising largely toward the women, yet the American male is more marked as a perfume buyer than the American female. More than “60 per cent of all perfume is bought by men for women, who, to the dismay of perfume makers, are about 80 per cent wrong in the way they use the product.” Scent manufacturers report that women know little about perfumes, and men a great deal less. But, says wo r Id's perfume king, Pierre Wertheimer, “a trained woman's nose knows more about perfume than the hest technician.**</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19551008_files/g_E_19551008-12.png" alt="" style="width:371pt;height:234pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">Maurice Talmage, who has been concocting devastating whiffs for 30 years, stated rather bluntly that “there isn't one woman in a thousand who can tell the difference between her favorite perfume and another similar brand.” He declared that women have dabbled with perfumes for centuries and yearly spend tens of millions of dollars on perfume to make themselves attractive to men. “But the funny thing is,” Talmage said, “they’re so interested in pretty bottles and exotic names they’re rarely aware of how attractive or unattractive a perfume actually may be.” Fanciful names, beautifully shaped bottles, various shades and colors—none of those things really count. His expert advice is that “women should choose perfumes by how they smell and nothing else. And then they should apply them very sparingly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Perfume reveals its carefully blended secrets when lightly and lovingly applied to the skin. The doctors of scent say that for best results chemicals in the individual's skin must harmonize with the perfume used. Otherwise, a fragrance changes or fades away. It should be applied with care at pulse spots, mainly in front of and not behind the ears, at the sides of the neck, at the temples, in the folds of the arms, inside the wrists and even behind the knees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">’ A light spray of perfume over i new hairdo will enhance its beauty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Perfume, however, should never be put on clothing. It may ridn or injure the fabric* When applied about the person in small amounts, perfume is more effective than when put on in a single big splash- One other thing. Do not expect one application to last Indefinitely. The fragrance soon evaporates, but retouching as necessary wfU keep the delightful vapors alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Toilet Water and Scent Appeal</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Toilet water is less concentrated than perfume. It may be applied more generously. “Perfume cologne” implies addition of other fragrances. In the United States colognes are merely perfumes diluted about seven times, and many times diluted as to cost. One authority says that a “woman who cannot afford Tabu can use Tabu cologne and smell just about the same. If she used no more than seven times as much cologne as perfume to get the same effect, cologne might be her better buy. The catch is that women hoard perfume, splash cologne.” These women fail to realize that fine perfume evaporates. So instead of economizing, they are actually wasting the precious aromatic oil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When wearing several fragrant preparations at one time, be sure they are compatible. Or let your perfume dominate and use lightly scented accessory preparations. Talmage admitted that perfume makers have been “trying for years and years to develop a perfume that will make men fall in love at first sniff, but our best efforts have been in vain.” foren the most tantalizing aroma is powerless, he said, unless a man is more than casually interested in a girl in the first place. A good perfume used carefully can enhance a woman’s beauty even as a fragrance enhances the beauty of a flower. But if she expects the perfume to do it all, she is in for a setback. Because, said Talmage, “perfume just doesn’t have what it takes,” despite what advertisers say to the contrary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It has been known for years, however, that perfumes produce actual physical reactions in both men and women, but there was no means of definitely determining the extent of the reactions. According to Professor R. C. Davis, who has been conducting experiments along this line with the help of the psychogalvanic reflex instrument, the human physical system does react to perfumes. His tests have shown that rarely do two persons react in the same manner to the same perfume. Therefore, buying the right perfume for someone else is risky business, unless you know the brand name. Lonnelle Aikman, writing for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The National Geographic Magazine,</span><span class="font1"> April, 1951, says: “Most people agree on what smells good and bad. But there are surprising variations. In group tests some have been found to favor odors generally considered revolting.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This authority further states that various colors can affect one’s judgment in selecting perfumes. For example, a large group was asked to test three bottles of differently colored perfume, nearly all gave reasons for favoring one over another although the odor actually was the same. A shaving-cream manufacturer inquired of thousands of men as to whether they preferred his product perfumed or unperfumed. Ninety-six per cent said they preferred the unperfumed articles. A little later, this same group of men was asked their preferences of two accompanying samples, 92 per cent favored the one that had been perfumed. Aikman states that customers are often unconscious of the lure in smell. The author tells of an experiment that was made with two sets of stockings placed on sale in a department store. The stockings were the same, except that those on one table were faintly scented with the rather unpleasant odor from the finishing process. The author says that decidedly more purchasers took the perfumed goods, though few consciously noticed the lightly applied fragrance. Their preference, they innocently explained, was dictated by “superior quality and finer texture.” Manufacturers today flavor most of their items with whiffs of perfume to boost sales. And it works like magic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">European and Latin-American men admittedly delight themselves with perfume, but North American men think the practice quite sissified. While these men shy away from labels marked cologne or perfume, they are easily wooed by a “ 'man’s cologne/ bottled in a sturdy container and decorated with horses and dogs.” F. A. Hampton, the author of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Scent of Flowers and Leaves; Its Purpose and Relation to Man,</span><span class="font1"> says that English people in general show a preference for rose, lavender, violet and the more definitely aromatic scents. The Latin races enjoy scents that northerners find unpleasantly sweet and heavy. In the Eastern nations the preference for heavy scents is still more marked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Why So Expensive?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is more to perfume than one can smell. The most delectable and expensive fragrances may contain tiny amounts of some of the worst smells known in nature. There are no less than thirty ingredients in each recipe, and some have as many as 2,000! These must be blended according to theme, taste and originality. In some of the complicated mixtures sometimes an infinitesimal amount—as small as one part in 50,000 of certain elements—is added to give a particular touch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All finished perfumes must use both synthetics and natural substances. The rose, the jasmin and the orange flower unite to form the wonders of fine perfume. Perfumers say that the rose adds richness, depth and smoothness to their creations. It takes about two to four tons of Bulgarian roses to produce one pound of rose oil. Jasmin is more precious than rose oil and is more widely used in quality perfumes. Jasmin imparts smoothness and gives “life” to the perfumer’s creation. Just one fragile blossom will scent a room. But the blossoms must be picked before daybreak, before the dew rises, to prevent 20 per cent loss in their fragrance. Almost every perfume creation, regardless of its overtone, employs some natural oil of jasmin. It is the perfumer’s one indispensable! Without it perfume would not be what it now is. Almost as precious to perfumers is the essence of orange blossoms, it requires 880 pounds of blossoms to make but one pound of oil. The violet yield of oil is microscopiq. An entire acre of the finest violets will yield only a few drops of the highly prized essence. Oil of violet leaves, while different in character, is also invaluable, as it gives a “leafy” or “dewy” effect to the violet fragrance. But again, it takes 33,000 pounds or about 161 tons of violet leaves to yield but one pound of the oil! “If perfumers were completely dependent on the minute oil reservoirs of the violet plant,” says Jill Jessee in her </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perfume Album,</span><span class="font1"> “only millionaires could afford to buy violet perfume.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Regardless of whether the perfume is a solid, like the unguents, or a liquid or powder, it has three components, namely, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">base</span><span class="font1"> of essential oils and aromatic chemicals that makes the odoriferous part, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fixative</span><span class="font1"> that gives “life” and durability to the odor, and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">solvent</span><span class="font1"> or diluting vehicle that thins down the concentrated^mell to a weakness that can be handled. From ten to fifty nations provide the base, which is seeds, barks, roots, leaves and flowers. Animal scent-secretions supply the fixatives. They slow up and equalize the evaporation of the more volatile oils. Castoreum comes from the Canadian beaver. Putrid-smelling civet, worth 40,000 francs a kilogram, comes from the civet cat in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Precious musk, worth many times the civet, comes from Asiatic musk deer. So valuable is it in perfume markets that hunters have risked the Tibetan lamas’ penalty for killing the deer—a punishment that called for cutting off both hands of the guilty and hailing them to the temple door. And ill-smelling waxy ambergris, valued at more than $1,000 a pound, is produced by sick sperm whales.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The manufacturer must be on guard against another factor. An authority explains : &quot;If Tabu were offered at a ‘reasonable’ profit, it would be gobbled up by the masses and presumably destroyed. A price of $17.50 per ounce (plus tax of $3.50) satisfactorily limits and prolongs its sale. The actual cost to the manufacturer is less than $2.50.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So like musical symphonies composed of different notes, some high, others low, some heavy, others light, yet all blended together in a pleasant and perfect harmony, in the same way man unites science and art to create from things made a harmony of odors called &quot;perfume.” And as the Bible says: &quot;Oil and perfume rejoice the heart.”—Proverbs 27:9, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Am, Stan, Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">HUMAN SACRIFICES</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">■SACRIFICING living cnuureu </span><span class="font15" style="font-variant:small-caps;">iaj ucuivu. </span><span class="font20">■ gods in this twentieth century is horrify-Hing, to say the least. But when these are committed in the name of God and religion by Scripture-quoting *‘priests” and “pastors,” the whole thing becomes unthinkable. Stuart Morrison, special correspondent of the New York </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span><span class="font20"> of April 24, 1955, reports that “two hundred men and women danced wildly and chanted hymns as they whirled about the flames that burned to death four children they had chosen as sacrifices in a weird jungle religious ceremony on Good Friday.” A police expeditionary force revealed details of the gory massacre. After having been tortured half to death, the four children were then burned alive. “The sect is called Adventists of Promise and numbers about 200. Its ceremonies were described by the police as part Christian, since the members sing hymns and recite chapters from the Bible during their orgies, and part Macumba—Brazilian version of African voodoo which is strong throughout the country. The sacrificed children were a girl, five years old, and three boys, one 10, the other two nine months.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The father of one of the slain children described the bloodthirsty “religious” rites to horrified police and newsmen. The report states that the children were thrown to the ground, kicked, &quot;beaten and stamped on by the crazed fanatics of the sect. When half dead, their bodies were tossed on a huge fire and in one case, [the father said] a child was</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ON 'GOOD FRIDAY”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">umviutu tutu uuuieu </span><span class="font15" style="font-variant:small-caps;">lu</span><span class="font20"> death. During the / burning alive, the father told police, the reli-\ gious fanatics danced around the leaping &lt;&nbsp;flames, singing hymns, and their ‘priest’ recited chapters from the Bible. During the orgy the priest shouted ‘Bum the devil out of their &lt;&nbsp;flesh and bones/ the father said.<sup>1</sup>’</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">While these religious orgies are horribly &gt;&nbsp;shocking, they have been identified with devil &lt;&nbsp;worshipers for ages. Baal worshipers in Jere-/ miah’s time sacrificed their children in fire, j But Almighty God Jehovah had no part in »’ their abominations. He states: “They built the ? high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and % their daughters to pass through the fire unto / Molech; which I commanded them not, neither / came it into my mind, that they should do this \ abomination, to cause Judah to sin.”—Jere-&gt; miah 32:35. k-</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">'» &nbsp;&nbsp;■ The above report might cause some people</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">\ to cringe in abhorrence to such practice. Yet, / many of these think nothing of charging God '■ with the same barbaric crime, and this without reason, by their teaching and propagating ? the “hell-fire” doctrine. These claim that God '■ Almighty torments and tortures wicked in-\ corrigibles and unbaptized babies without / their having any hope of deliverance. This / falsehood taught is more wicked and barbaric than those demonic sacrifices held in the jun-i; gles of Brazil, for it claims God continues the '&gt; torture forever. Both have their origin with J Satan the Devil.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">HE hypothalamus?” you exclaim, “I never heard of it before!” Well, that is not surprising. Most likely ninety-nine out of every hundred have not heard of this part of the brain either. In fact, Dr, Berglund, in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">It’s Not AU in Your Mind<sub>}</sub></span><span class="font1"> says regarding the hypothalamus: “Its workings are so obscure that many doctors try to avoid thinking about it by denying that it exists,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Toward the base of the cerebrum or main part of the brain is a section termed the diencephalon,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">a name having two Greek roots, dia meaning “through,” and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">enkephalos</span><span class="font1"> meaning *‘brain.” Among the various parts of the diencephalon is the hypothalamus, a name also having two Greek roots, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hypo</span><span class="font1"> meaning ‘‘under” and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">thalamos</span><span class="font1"> meaning “bed, bedroom, chamber,” the thalamus also being a part of the diencephalon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">quency and strength, electrical impulses on one part of the hypothalamus will cause the animal to shiver as if cold, on another part will cause it to growl as if angry, on still another part will cause its hair to stand on end, etc. This type of experiment is possible because the nerve impulses of the body are electrical in nature, in fact,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The hypothalamus is about the size of can be measured in terms of voltage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">a walnut and accounts for about one threehundredth of the size of the brain. Since the brain of the average man weighs about fifty ounces, the hypothalamus weighs only a fraction of an ounce. Only about a century ago did doctors begin to take notice of it, the first comprehensive work dealing with it not appearing until the last decade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Scientists have used various methods to gain information about the tiny hypothalamus, From autopsies they have established a relationship between its diseased state and certain mental ailments. By making lesions, cutting off or destroying a part of it in experimental animals they are able to note the various roles it plays in animal behavior. They also use cathodes by which they give electrical impulses to various parts of the hypothalamus to discover the same. Depending upon their fre-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Co-ordination and Automation</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The hypothalamus occupies a key position in the central nervous system, the brain and spinal cord, it acting as a coordinator of both the sympathetic and the parasympathetic or vagus nervous systems. The sympathetic nervous system is that set of nerves that goes into action in an emergency calling for fight or flight. On the other hand the parasympathetic or vagus nervous system is that set of nerves that regulates the normal functions of the body such as breathing, heartbeat and digestion. The two act as checks on each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The hypothalamus might be said to be the connecting link between the higher centers of the brain and these two systems. In the higher centers the cause for emotion originates, by what they see, hear or imagine, etc., and the hypothalamus translates these into actions. Though termed the center of emotions, it is thus seen actually to be only the center for producing the physical manifestations of emotion. Recent research indicates that it is also the boss g</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">land</span><span class="font1"> of the chain of ductless glands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is well termed “the concert master of the symphony of human behavior,&quot; and the foremost United States authority on it writes: **The supreme mystery lies in the commonplace phenomena, so exquisitely maintained that they excite almost no attention. The regularity of the rhythm of breathing, the constancy of the pulse rate, the exact maintenance of body temperature, the beautiful balance between intake and output of fluid, the cycle of sleep/* woman's menstrual cycle, etc., “all these ebbs and flows are instrumented primarily through the hypothalamus.&quot; Modem man is proud of his automatic factories utilizing automation, but the Creator put automation in the human body thousands of years ago!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Body's Thermostat</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Air conditioning the body by keeping its liquid content uniform and its temperature at 98.6 is also primarily the job of the marvelous hypothalamus. Its efficiency in this respect accounts for the fact that man can thrive in both arctic and equatorial regions. To appreciate the role it plays in man and other warm-blooded animals let us note how cold-blooded animals such as lizards and snakes fare. “Cold-blooded animals may regulate their body temperature at optimal [most favorable] levels by moving from sunshine to shade, or by changing positions in order to expose greater or less surface to the sun. When such temperatures are attained, those functions having to do with defense, nutrition and reproduction are consummated; this results in individual and species survival.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With evening, these cold-blooded animals, without any ability to retain heat, lose warmth to their environment. This leads to a slowing down of metabolism, of circulation and of general activity: the animal may fall into a sleep-like torpor. Each day this cycle of warming and activity, cooling and torpidity is repeated/'</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the other hand, “the remarkable stable body temperature of warm-blooded animals Is evidence of an efficient thermostatic control. Heat is continuously formed in the body, even during rest, and the amount thus formed is very greatly increased by muscular activity. To maintain an even temperature the rate of heat loss must be adjusted to the rate of heat formation and this adjustment is complicated by changing environmental temperatures. A high external temperature reduces heat elimination, and vigorous exercise increases heat production, causing body temperature to rise and thus starting heat loss activities such as dilation of the cutaneous blood vessels [capillaries] and sweating. In carnivores panting is the chief means of heat elimination. Exposure to cold causes shivering which increases heat production and constriction of the cutaneous vessels which reduces heat loss by diminishing the flow of warm blood to the skin.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Incidentally, this is why a sudden change of temperature of the water in a fish tank will kill tropical fish; being cold-blooded they do not have a mechanism that helps them to adjust to such sudden changes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All the brain above the hypothalamus can be removed without affecting the body's heat regulation, but if the hypothalamus is removed or the brain stem is severed below the hypothalamus thermostatic regulation is greatly impaired if not entirely destroyed. Damage to the hypothalamus results in inability to sweat, causing a rise in temperature. Certain parts of the hypothalamus regulate the various processes above described. Heat causes blood to become thinner; cold causes it to become thicker. When the blood becomes thicker not only has it more red cells in proportion to volume but its plasma also contains more protein proportionately. The extra water goes into the spleen, liver, muscles or else is carried off by the kidneys or the intestines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Defense Mechanism</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The body’s defense system, which is both triggered and co-ordinated by the hypothalamus, might be illustrated by the way a large city during World War H responded to an air raid alarm: Lights went out, people left off their regular tasks and either manned special posts or sought refuge in air raid shelters, nurses and doctors and ambulances were alerted, antiaircraft guns and searchlights went into action and interceptor planes rose to meet the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A very similar defense pattern for emergencies goes into action when sudden danger confronts a human. Blood vessels leading to the internal organs, except the heart, constrict so that the blood is forced into the muscles for extra strength, additionally extra hormones from the hypothalamus (according to latest research) as well as from the pituitary and the adrenals are poured into the blood for extra strength. At the same time the blood also leaves the surface of the body, accounting for facial pallor and for cold and clammy hands. Among the most common manifestations of the defense mechanism is that of the hair standing on end and goose pimples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These various manifestations, we are told, “represent a widespread discharge of sympathetic impulse, in an effort to cope with a critical situation. Only one center in the central nervous system is known to co-ordinate such apparently diverse mechanism, the hypothalamus.” Thus it raises and lowers the blood pressure and increases or decreases the pulse rate as the situation requires. Nor does any part of the brain so affect the secretions of the stomach as well as its rhythm and that of the intestines as does the hypothalamus. Muscular tone, or that permanent tension that gives muscles their firmness and keeps them ever ready for immediate action, is also controlled by the hypothalamus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Appetite, Sleep and Sex Center</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Experiments have also disclosed that the hypothalamus is the appetite center of the body. Destroy a certain part of it and animals will eat from two to three times as much and gain up to 70 per cent in weight. Destroy a tiny section right next to that part and the animals will refuse all food, starving to death because of having no desire to eat, this being true even of animals that had previously eaten two to three times as much because of damage to another part of the hypothalamus. Animals that had thus refused food, however, gained practically normal appetites by being fed with a tube from six to sixty-five days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Obviously our appetites are not the sole criterion of whether we should eat or not, since experimental animals ate three times as much as they needed or refused food on the basis of the condition of their hypothalamus. And this would seem to indicate that just as persons with too good an appetite must restrain themselves so those without appetites must make themselves eat so as to get enough nourishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The sleep mechanism is perhaps the least understood of all the body’s natural functions. However, it has been learned that the hypothalamus also plays a vital role in the “diurnal^rhythm of sleep.” Injury to the hypothalamus causes excessive sleepiness. On the other hand, an overactive hypothalamus accounts for an excitable disposition and “nerves.” From this it is apparent that the influence of the hypothalamus not only extends downward, which it does to the extent of governing even elimination, but also upward to the higher centers of the brain, to the mind with its will, imagination, memory and sense perception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And finally, as far as this discussion is concerned (for the last word regarding it has by no means been said and to treat the hypothalamus comprehensively would require a thousand-page volume), it has a direct bearing on sexual activity. While for long man has considered the gonads as the basis for sex activity, yet these are impotent when the hypothalamus is injured, One of the very latest works on the diencephalon states: “That all aspects of the sex drive also originate in the hypothalamus is shown by the experiments of [certain scientists] who were able to carry out a kind of ‘central castration’ by thermo coagulation in the region of the tuber cinereum,” the tuber cinereum being a sort of continuation of the hypothalamus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All in all, the foregoing information has its practical aspects. Human nature is ever prone to go to an extreme, and here we see a biological basis for it. Friend husband either fails to get enthusiastic about his wife’s culinary art in spite of its excellence or he overeats, all because of his hypothalamus. On the other hand, friend wife may be Jacking in ardor because of a lack in her hypothalamus. The slow and easygoing one is irritated by the overactive one, and vice versa, but each one is just built that way because of his hypothalamus. Not that we should not try to become balanced in all things, but try as we may we shall always have innate tendencies to contend </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">with and this understanding</span><span class="font1"> will make us patient with others as well as keep us from getting discouraged ourSelves.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font20">&lt;1 There is a story told by Moss Hart, the playwright, in a letter to Bennett Cerf, printed originally in Cerf’s “Trade Winds” column in the Saturday Keview that is pertinent today when so many parents believe in total freedom for a child:</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">&lt;L “The Klobber Method was discovered, or rather invented, by Ernest J. Klobber, a Viennese psychiatrist who, at the time of the discovery of the method which was to bear his name, was a staunch believer in the modern and accepted formula for rearing children. ... So great an exponent of this formula was Professor Klobber that, at the time of his discovery, the Professor, who has six children of his own, was about to be carted oflf to a sanitarium in a state of complete nerV' ous collapse; a condition any modem parent will understand at once. As the stretcher was being carried out of the house one of the children aimed a kick at it which, with unerring childlike aim, landed exactly where it was meant to land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The Professor, though thoroughly used to being kicked by his children, was under mild sedation at the time, and it may have been this that caused a curious reflex action on the Professor’s part. Bringing his am up from the stretcher, he brought his hand down with a good sharp crack. . , . There was an anguished howl from the child-first time in its life no reason had been given for an action—but the effect on the Prbfessor was startling. He leaped up from the stretcher and gave each of the other five kiddies in turn a good smart crack, , . . Life, for the Professor and his good wife, was livable for the first time since the patter of little feet had thundered through the house.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">UTNFIDELITY in marriage is more </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">I</span><span class="font1"> common than most people wish to believe,” said Dr. Abraham Stone, director of the Marriage Consultation Center of the Community Church of New York. A recent survey showed that “among 10,000 persons interviewed, one out of every two married men and one out of every four married women up to the age of 40 admitted extramarital relations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Plural marriages may be legally practiced in many lands and there are societies that grant men to have common-law wives. But these customs are not Christian. They are not the standard that God established in Eden. He gave man only one wife. “And Jehovah God proceeded to build the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman and to bring her to the man. Then the man said: ‘This is at last bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. This one will be called Woman, because from man this one was taken.’ That is why a man will leave his father and his mother and he must stick to his wife and they must become one flesh.” His unalterable law provides for only two to become “one flesh,” not three or four or more.—Genesis 2:22-24, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jesus upheld this God-given principle in his reply to the Pharisees who questioned him about divorce. Jesus said: “Did you not read that he who created them at the beginning made them male and female and said: 'For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and will stick to his wife, and the two will be one flesh’? So that they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has yoked together let no man put apart.” The laws of most democratic lands also recognize that a man have only one wife, and by social and religious custom he is expected to remain faithful to her in the marriage bond. God’s law to Christians plainly states that a man practicing polygamy lives in adultery, and that any one living in common-law marriage is practicing fornication. Both are violators of Jehovah’s moral code and will suffer adversely for it. —Matthew 19:4-6, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Infidelity, or more specifically adultery, remains the one offense that is legal ground for divorce throughout the United States. Scripturally, it is the one offense that allows for divorce and severance of the marriage tie, freeing one to remarry. &quot;I say to you that whoever divorces his wife except on the grounds of fornication and marries another commits adultery,” declared Jesus. In a study of 148 different societies, Dr. George P. Murdock has found that in only five are adulterous relationships condoned. “Marital fidelity,” said Dr. Murdock, “is one of the main buttresses of any social structure.”—Matthew 19:9, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Christians are warned against promiscuity and infidelity. Paul warns against such sins, “for God will judge fornicators and adulterers.” Jehovah says: “I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers.” So it is disastrously dangerous to expose oneself to advice of “marriage counselors” who wink at infidelity or try to justify extramarital affairs as a safety valve, or who regard it as an emotional disturbance or a neurotic tendency. Such men have no regard for God’s law. To listen to them is to jeopard-</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;">Ize one’s life.—Hebrews 13:4, </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Trans.;</span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;"> Malachi 3:5, </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Dr. Kinsey states that man's promiscuity is natural, that it &quot;is undoubtedly a product of his interest in a variety of experience.” But does a base desire for extramarital affairs justify breaking God’s law? No; no more so than a desire to murder, defraud, lie and steal is justifiable for the same reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A husband’s extramarital sexual relations cause involvement of others, his wife, his children, the other party, and it may involve still others. In case of a dedicated servant of Jehovah, infidelity directly affects his relationship with God and with his congregation. In fact, his unfaithful conduct directly or indirectly stigmatizes his entire field of association. It brings others into question and disrepute. In this connection Paul says: &quot;Flee from fornication. Every other sin which a man may commit is outside his body, but he that practices fornication is sinning against his own body. What! Do you not know that the body of you people is the temple of the holy spirit within you which you have from God? Also, you do not belong to yourselves, for you were bought with a price. By all means, glorify God in the body of you people.” So the enormity of the crime of infidelity cannot be lightly brushed aside as of little or no consequence. It is an Infraction of God’s law and if pursued It will prevent one from inheriting the Kingdom.—1 Corinthians 6:9, 10, 18-20, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Facts show that not all who stray from the marital bed are neurotic, immature, emotional casualties, as some psychiatrists claim. These may be exceptions, not the rule. As far as a casual extramarital affair's preserving a shaky marriage, Dr. Stone completely shatters that absurdity. He says that, in a quarter century of counseling on marital problems, &quot;I cannot recall a single case where infidelity has strengthened the marital bond. ... In fact, it usually leads to deep personal conflicts and family disruption.” Emotional injuries, deep resentment, bewilderment, insecurity, shame and grief are usually the result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Follow the Scriptural advice and you will be happier for it: &quot;Let marriage be honorable among aU, and the marriage bed be without defilement, for God will judge fornicators and adulterers.”—Hebrews 13:4, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">In his </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">A Window on the Avenue</span><span class="font20"> Edward Streeter, a vice’presidfcnt of a New York bank, writes of the time when Caruso had to sing to cash a check: '&quot;The relationship of the bank to the Metropolitan Opera Company has always been a close one, and most of the great singers have carried accounts there at one time or another. . . . Caruso was a depositor. One day he came into the bank at the noon hour to cash a check and happened to go to a new teller. Forty-fourth Street and Fifth Avenue Is a windy comer where anything can happen, and when an alert young paying teller sees a famous name like Caruso's on a check, he instinctively becomes suspicious. In this case the fact that the person on the other side of the wicket looked like Caruso only increased his doubts. The more Caruso tried to convince the distracted teller that he was Caruso, the more convinced the latter became that he was a fraud. Then Caruso had&quot; an inspiration. Stepping back a few paces from the teller’s window so that he would not blow the money around, he placed one hand on his breast and began to sing an aria from ‘Tosca? Long before he had finished, the teller began to count the money out in a panic. When he came to the end, Caruso bowed and took his money, while the customers and the clerks cheered.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">&lt;£• For a generation rocket ex pens have been working on the goal of sending an earth-circling satellite into spate. The Germans made progress toward this goal when they developed the V-2 bombs. Since then research on rockets has proceeded feverishly in both East and West. In 1349 the U.S, sent up the Wac Corporal, a two-stage rocket that reached a height cf 250 miles. In July the U.S. announced plans to launch history’s first man-made. earth -circling satellite into space during 1957 or 1958. The preposed earth satellite vehicle will flash around the earth about once every 99 minutes at a. speed of 18,000 miles an hour in a fixed path 200 to 300 miles above the ground. After being pushed off by a final rocket blast, the vehicle will travel without power, entirely under its own momentum. Since there is some air at 200 miles cr more, the vehicle will slow down. As it slows it will begin to spiral toward the earth. Upon hitting the thick cushion of air that wraps the planet, the vehicle will vaporize and disappear in minute particles miles above the earth. The greatest return that scientists expect the satellite will bring is knowledge of conditions in the outer atmosphere. It is expected also to provide information cn the nature of the sun and cosmic radiation. Scientists hailed the announcement as marking what may possibly be one of the greatest achievements of mankind. In August the world’s leading scientific specialists on space flight, gathered at Copenhagen, predicted that if man succeeds in placing an unmanned earth satellite by 1958 he can set loot on the moon by /he end of this century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">Harnessing the Atom</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In the decade since Hiroshima the nations have made progress in harnessing the atom, hut they have done so behind the barriers of national secrecy. In August, at the Geneva International Conference on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, the curtain of secrecy was lifted, as the UA, Britain. France and the Soviet Union shared fundamental secrets essential to the production of atomic power. At the meeting was histcr/s largest assemblage of the world's leading scientists—1.260 delegates from 72 nations. The subject that created the greatest interest was the potential use of the atom as a source of power. New discoveries, it was disclosed, promise to reduce the cost and make atomic power for many parts of the world competitive with other fuels within a few years. Western scientists listed the other most important revelations at Geneva as: (1) the development of a breeder reactor—one that can produce more fissionable material than is put into it—Is already far advanced; (2) the leading nations are hopeful of making progress on the problem of harnessing for peaceful purposes the energy released in the fusion process—the process that gives the H-bomb its tremendous power; and (3) if fusion becomes practical for power production all the water in the oceans is potential fuel. The 2,000 participants and observers pronounced the meeting a resounding success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">New Kind of Thaw</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">&lt;$&gt; Th? thaw In East-West relations began last March—a month after the Bulganin-Khrushchev regime came to power. During five months of warmer political weather Moscow granted Austria its sovereignty and restored relations with Yugoslavia. The Big Four heads of government have also met, and the international conference on the peaceful use of the atom has been marked,by an unbelievable freedom of exchange. In August a still different kind of thaw took place in the cold war, one that amazed the West, &quot;Recent developments,” said the Soviet news agency Tass, “show that a certain relaxation of international tension has been achieved. With a view to promoting the relaxation of International tension and establishing confidence among the nations, the Soviet Government has decided to reduce the armed forces of the Soviet Union by 640,000 men by 15th December, 1955.” Though knowing that it would be difficult to check up on how the Russians followed out their promised cutback, there was an exultant stir among Western officials. They felt they had a basis for rejoicing, since the Soviet regime, in all its nearly</span></p>

<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">4</span><span class="font20"> More than two months after naval and air force units staged an abortive revolt, Argentina refused to settle down. In August another antl-Perdn plot was announced. The disclosure of a plot to assassinate Perdn was followed by arrests of several hundred opposition members—ranging from Communists to Catholic Actfonlsts. As the federal police made their sweeping raids throughout Buenos Aires, they arrested three priests. The clerics were charged with being involved In the latest Per6n assassination plot. There were general charges that priests hid been inciting “subversive activity.’* Provincial police announced that a raid on a Roman Catholic school in suburban San Isidoro uncovered a store of explosives and ammunition. The arrests gave rise to the view that a new antichurch campaign was In the offing. On one cathedral’s walls were chalked the slogans: “Perdu yes, priests no—priests are murderers.&quot; That Argentina was uneasy was only too apparent as Roman Catholic of* facials warned priests to discard their cassocks and to walk the streets in civilian clothing, and the Supreme Council of the Peronist party announced that it was going to reassume the fighting role it had in 1946, the year Pferdn was elected to the presidency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">Tendon over Go*</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Since the beginning of the sixteenth century Portugal has ruled over Goa, a 1,300-square-mlle area on the west coast of India. The Goan people, ethnically, are Indian, So New Delhi has long pressed the Portuguese to get out. Not satisfied with New Delhi’s efforts, the Indian Communist and Socialist parties organized a “passive resistance<sup>1</sup>' cam-palgn to bring further pressure on the Portuguese. On Indian Independence Day (8/15) pressure was applied: hundreds of Indians tried to walk into Goa as a demonstration of protest. But Portuguese soldiers, armed with machine guns and grenades, were waiting. When the first demonstrators crossed the border, the soldiers fired a volley In the air. When they moved forward again the Portuguese shut to kill. When the shooting ended, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">22 Indians</span><span class="font20"> had been killed and scores wounded. News of the shooting, upon reaching India, set off riots. Furious rioters brought out effigies of Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar, which they hanged and burned. As tension reached a high pitch, Lisbon sent New Delhi a stern note protesting the attempted “invasion.&quot; Indian Prime Minister Nehru deplored the Portuguese action in shooting down unarmed Indians as “brutal and uncivilized.” A few days later India broke eff diplomatic relations with Portugal and tension over Goa appeared likely to continue at a high pitch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">Vloleoc* in North Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">4&gt; The postwar growth cf nationalism In North Africa has oeen rapid. In August the demands for self rule In Morocco and Algeria brought gruesome violence. In Algeria, where the nationalists have organized an outlaw army 2,500 strong, the nation alls t guerrillas stormed the city of Constantine (100,COO population). The French garrison fought back. When the fighting ended the death toll was over 1,000, Meanwhile in Morocco, where the nationalists have Jost a leader of influence by the French deposing of Sultan Mohammed ban Yoia-sef, the second anniversary of the sultan’s deposing was the signal for trouble. Berber tribesmen of the Smala tribe emerged from the hills and swooped down on the cities of the plain. They swept through Khenlfra, killing and burning. At Oued Zem, a town of 5,000 Arabs and Frenchmen, they blocked all roads. Then with knives in hand they stormed through the streets, Frenchwomen and children were stabbed to death. Whole families were burned in their homes. By the time French Le glonnalres arrived, the tribesmen were gone. The Legion naires wreaked vengeance on the local Arabs by </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">blasting </span><span class="font20">their huts and shops with cannon. Then they pursued the Smala tribesmen and surrounded their village, 'Hie warriors surrendered. Said the French commander: “If France did not have a heart you would all be dead.” As it was, the dead in Morocco numbered over 70C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">Death over Bulgaria</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Nine times since World War II Communist planes or ground batteries have shot or forced down nonmill tary-type planes of noncommunlst countries. The tenth incident, occurring In July, aroused the most intense Indignation in the West. It resulted fn a greater loss of life than all the other nine incidents combined. An Israeli air liner on a 2,300-mlIe flight from London to Lydda, Israel, strayed off its scheduled route and crossed a few miles ever the border into Bulgaria. Bulgarian Jet fighters attacked the air liner, making three firing </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">runs with rochets and</span><span class="font20"> machine guns as the plane sought a landing. Bie aircraft exploded in mid-air. All 58 persons aboard the plane—Israelis, Americans, Britons and Russians—were killed. In August Bulgaria acknowledged that two ©I her fighter planes shot down the air liner. Sophia expressed regret and admitted that the fighters had been “too hasty.&quot; Bulgaria offered to pay damages to relatives of victims as well as share the cost of the plane.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">In Its eight years of Independence Pakistan has experienced serious difficulty In establishing democratic self-government The country's paramount Job Is to write &amp;&nbsp;constitution. For six years a Constituent Assembly tried to write one, but in vain. In October, 1953, the Assembly was dissolved by Governor General Ghulam Mohammed. Since then Ghulam Mohammed has ruled by decree. In August a new Constituent Assembly convened. Shortly thereafter Ghulam Mohammed resigned as governor general because of bad health. He was replaced by his personal prot6g£, Maj. Gen. Iskander Mirza. On the same day Pakistan’s prime minister, Mohammed All, resigned. He was replaced by Finance Minister Ch audit Mohammed All. Pakistan's new regime is now faced with the immediate task of finishing the work on the constitution that began eight years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">Tim Hurricane-triggered Floods </span><span class="font20">&lt;$&gt; Winds and high tides are not the only blows a hurricane can pack. This is because a hurricane has long arms of wind that extend as far as 500 miles from the core. If these hit a separate mass of warm, moist air, the effect may tie to trigger additional rains to reinforce those of the hurricane </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Itself. Just how disastrous</span><span class="font20"> this can be became a grim reality in August when the hurricane Diane hit hot and humid northeast U.S., releasing a torrent of rain. For 24 hours rains fell from burst clouds. Rivers hurdled their banks and trickling creeks became deadly monsters, Large areas of the northeast were inundated. The flash floods brought sudden death. The worst single disaster struck Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. The usually gentle Brodhead Creek rose 30 feet in 15 minutes, leaving more than 50 dead. At Camp Davis, a religious retreat, 31 of some 40 campers, nearly all of them women and children, were dead or missing. Helicopters made many dramatic rescues, one of them being the rescue of 235 passengers on a stranded Lackawanna Railroad train in the Pocono Mountains. The flood damage is staggering. In six bffdJy </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">hurt states—Connecticut,</span><span class="font20"> New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania ■ and Rhode Island— the death toll stood at 191, with many more missing. Property damage is estimated at close to $2,000,000,000. More than 20,000 homes were destroyed or damaged; 40.000 people were homeless, It was one cf the most disastrous floods in U.S. history.</span></p>
